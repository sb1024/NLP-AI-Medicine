"A portable photoacoustic imager for diagnosing vascular diseases Project Summary/Abstract Vascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. Some common vascular diseases include: cardio vascular disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease (PAD). Many of these vascular diseases need point-of- care (POC) diagnosis and monitoring using non-ionizing, non-invasive and cost-effective approaches. Although Doppler ultrasound meets all these requirements, it only maps blood flow, which is operator dependent and influenced by motion artifacts, resulting in limited sensitivity and specificity to detect the disease in its early stage. A POC technique that provides direct label-free molecular and functional information of vasculature is needed to reliably detect and monitor vascular diseases.  A mobile photoacoustic imager (mPAI) is proposed for diagnosing various vascular diseases in resource poor settings of the world. Leveraging on strong multispectral optical absorption of oxy- and de-oxy hemoglobins, the mPAI is capable of providing multi-parametric information of deep vasculature, such as blood oxygen saturation, plaque lipids, blood flow and blood clot. The mPAI is non-invasive, real time and uses non-ionizing optical and ultrasound radiation. This will be the first and perhaps the only portable technology capable of deriving such multiparametric functional information of deep vasculature without the use of contrast agents. Competing technologies cannot provide such a direct information of vascular health, and certainly not in a compact portable device form. Health care providers can use the mPAI to instantly diagnose several vascular diseases affecting humans of all ages, including infants.  In the R21 phase, Aim1 will design and develop the mPAI, integrating the low-cost optical illumination and piezoelectric micromachined ultrasound transducer (PMUT) arrays. Dr. Rundra Pratap team from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, will design and fabricate the PMUT arrays. Dr. Kothapalli team will develop the mPAI and validate its performance on tissue mimicking vascular phantoms in Aim 1, and rat models of PAD in Aim 2. The ultimate goal of the two-year R21 phase is to achieve a clinical grade mPAI device with reliable vascular imaging metrics.  In the R33 phase, to test the clinical performance of the mPAI, the following multicenter pilot clinical studies on PAD patients will be conducted in 1) Penn State Hershey medical center, 2) Vikram Hospital in India through collaborations with the IISc team, and 3) in Ghana in Year 5 with the help of Dr. Colette Pameijer of Penn State who conducts medical camps in Ghana every year through Penn State Global Health Program. Clinical studies in R33 phase will be undertaken only if well-defined milestones are achieved in the R21 phase.  The overall goal of these studies is to carefully validate the clinical potential of emerging label-free photoacoustic imaging technology to screen for vascular diseases, in a portable form, in resource poor settings of the world. Project Narrative Vascular diseases are becoming epidemic with increase in aging population, obesity and type II diabetes. They affect humans of all age groups, including neonates.

"International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions (MICCAI) 2020 Project summary  The Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions (MICCAI) society is dedicated to the promotion, preservation and facilitation of research and education in the fields of medical image computing and computer assisted interventions, including biomedical imaging and robotics. This aim is achieved through the organization and operation of regular international conferences of the highest quality, and publications that promote and foster the exchange and dissemination of advanced knowledge, expertise and experience by leading institutions and outstanding scientists, physicians, and educators around the world. MICCAI Conferences have their origin in three separate but related conferences beginning in early 1990s--Visualization in Biomedical Computing, Computer Vision and Virtual Reality in Robotics and Medicine, and Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery--, which merged into a single annual conference in 1998. MICCAI Conferences have defined new scientific disciplines over the years and have become the premier meeting in the field. The conference proceedings have an impact factor comparable to high-impact computational journals. Conference topics include, computer vision & medical image processing, computer-aided diagnosis, interventions & surgery, machine learning in medical imaging, guidance systems & robotics, visualization and virtual reality, bioscience and biology applications, imaging systems and new biomedical imaging applications, spanning disciplines such as radiology, pathology, surgery, oncology, cardiology, physiology, and psychiatry.  The MICCAI conference includes three days of oral presentations and poster sessions. The quality and importance of poster presentations are considered to be on a par with those of oral presentations, with both undergoing a rigorous double-blinded peer-review (~30% acceptance). Selected presented papers became landmark publications over the years with up to 2,000 citations. The conference series includes satellite events like community-driven software challenges, workshops and tutorials just before and/or after the main conference. These events focus on the current status and advances in topics relevant to MICCAI and are very well attended. The MICCAI Conferences span the entire globe and are usually rotated among the American, European, and Asian continents. Attendees are typically from over 45 countries, with strong student representation (>40%). The MICCAI 2020 Conference will be held in Lima, Peru in October 4th-8th, 2020. Since 2018, a Mentorship Program to connect students and young investigators with established mentors from academia and industry is also part of the conference. Along with the Mentorship Program and mission of the “Women in MICCAI” Committee, this proposal requests funds to support student and early investigator travel awards to enhance diversity in conference attendance (including women, underrepresented minorities, students with disabilities, and people from disadvantaged backgrounds) and provide minority groups with a unique opportunity to reach an international audience for career development and collaborations.

"IEEE Medical Imaging Conference Abstract  The IEEE Medical Imaging Conference (MIC) is the leading international scientific meeting bringing together a broad community interested in the physics, engineering and mathematical aspects of medical imaging, with special emphasis on nuclear medicine and multi-modal systems. The MIC runs in conjunction with the IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium (NSS) and the Workshop on Room Temperature Semiconductor X-ray and Gamma-ray Detectors (RTSD).  The purpose of the MIC is to disseminate and foster new research in physics and bio-engineering methods in medical imaging. While the traditional topics of primary interest are related to nuclear medicine techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), increasing space will be also given to recently evolving imaging modalities such as X-ray, CT, optical, MR, with special emphasis on their multi-modal combination with nuclear medical imaging. Recently there has also been additional interest in employing deep learning and AI to enhance the field medical imaging. The conference provides a well-established forum of scientific exchange and dialogue between researchers in academia, industry, and government as well as education of the public, with special emphasis on young generations. This is reflected by the large spectrum of educational refresher sessions and short courses. One of the major objectives of the conference is the education of young investigators, and therefore this NIH R13 proposal seeks $10,000 in funding for each of the next three years to provide 20 trainee grants of $500 each to partially cover costs of MIC conference registration, housing and/or short course fees for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows based at US institutions.  We anticipate that the main impact of this grant program will be to increase attendance of students and postdocs at the 2020 meeting, especially those typically underrepresented, as well as to support their participation in educational activities. It is important to bring young generations, especially women, minorities, and those with disabilities, into the medical imaging field, where they could become main actors in the coming years. They will attend plenary and oral presentations given by many of the world leaders in the nuclear medical imaging instrumentation, image processing, and quantitative analysis fields. Moreover, they will be given the unique opportunity of direct personal interaction through the short courses and dedicated poster presentations. In turn their work will be exposed to the other participants for critical evaluation, constructive suggestions and dissemination. Furthermore, many of these trainees will likely continue in this field, thereby contributing to advancing technology with high societal relevance as being increasingly used in the clinical management of disease and therapeutic interventions. Narrative  The IEEE Medical Imaging Conference (MIC) has the purpose to disseminate and foster new research in physics and bio-engineering methods in medical imaging. The conference covers a variety of medical imaging topics including quantitative imaging, PET/SPECT techniques, image reconstruction, imaging in radiation therapy, portable imaging, multi-modality systems, new medical imaging technologies, CT/MR/optical/ultrasound, parametric/kinetic image modeling, and signal/image processing and modeling. One of the major objectives of the conference is the education and encouragement of young investigators, and therefore this NIH R13 proposal seeks funding to provide twenty grants for each of the next three years to graduate students and postdoctoral fellows based at US institutions to partially cover costs of MIC conference registration and short course fees.",IEEE Medical Imaging Conference,10071524,R13EB030423,"['Academia', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Clinical Management', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational workshop', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Fees', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Gamma Rays', 'Generations', 'Government', 'Grant', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'International', 'Italy', 'Japan', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Technology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nuclear', 'Optics', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Photons', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Semiconductors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Students', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detector', 'disability', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'kinetic model', 'meetings', 'member', 'models and simulation', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'nanoparticle', 'novel', 'nuclear science', 'parametric imaging', 'portability', 'posters', 'programs', 'public education', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiation detector', 'reconstruction', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'theranostics']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R13,2020,10000,551214295,0.0038699776692463677
"8th International CEST workshop (CEST2020) Project Summary/Abstract The 8th International Workshop of chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI in November 2020 (CEST2020) brings together an international community of experts in CEST imaging. CEST MRI has gained tremendous interest from the research community, and many leading institutions have joined forces to optimize CEST MRI and develop new applications in a host of diseases including acute stroke, epilepsy, and, most importantly, tumor imaging. Recently, machine learning and neuron networks have been explored for CEST imaging. The CEST 2020 forges research and learning opportunities for students and young researchers in a dedicated forum unmatched by other meetings. CEST 2020 is being organized by Phillip Zhe Sun, Ph.D. (Emory University), in conjunction with the CEST Workshop steering committee of well- established scholars in the CEST MRI field. It will run November 8-11, 2020, at the Emory Conference Center Hotel located on the Emory University campus in Atlanta, Georgia. The goal is to bring together researchers from varying backgrounds and clinicians from related disciplines and to provide a forum for communication among these multi-disciplinary groups. The workshop will feature a blend of plenary sessions, invited scientific presentations, manuscripts, poster presentations, and panel discussions. The meeting will provide all participants the opportunity to present and learn emerging applications of CEST imaging. Emory University researchers have contributed to the development of the CEST MRI field, from the theory, experimental optimization, and quantification. Members well established in the CEST MRI field including Dr. Peter van Zijl, Dr. Dean Sherry, Dr. John Gore, Dr. Marty Pagel, and Dr. Reddy Ravinder, will attend and present their work. This creates an outstanding intellectual enrichment opportunity not just for well-established investigators but also for students, postdocs and junior faculty as they enter into this exciting field of MRI research. The primary goal is to create opportunities and offer supportive mentoring at this formative stage in the trainee's career to enhance their research potential and the likelihood of success. We will have two plenary sessions, two poster sessions, and two power pitch sessions, in which the goal is to share the state of the art CEST research and engage newcomers to the field. Also, we will select 3-4 oral presentations for each scientific session from submitted abstracts to promote the rising stars in the field and provide our feedback on their work, strength, and, most importantly, areas to improve. This grant will support students, postdocs and junior faculty to participate in the CEST2020 Workshop. Project Narrative The 8th Biennial International CEST workshop (CEST 2020) will focus on the technical development of CEST imaging and clinical applications in a broad spectrum of diseases.

"Mobile bedside ultrasound for the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia in resource limited settings Project Summary In low and middle-income countries (LMICs) pneumonia is by far the leading cause of death among children < 5 years of age. Despite progress in reducing global pneumonia deaths, pneumonia still kills over 1 million children a year. A key factor is the challenge of pneumonia diagnosis. Chest X-Ray is the gold standard for pneumonia diagnoses but exposes children to ionizing radiation and is mainly restricted to hospital settings. Outside of hospitals, pneumonia is diagnosed based on clinical grounds using the WHO’s Integrated Management of Childhood Illness algorithms. However, that approach lacks specificity, resulting in significant overdiagnosis of pneumonia. That wastes precious resources, exposes children to antibiotics unnecessarily, and delays identification of the true cause of a child’s illness. Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in bedside ultrasound as a radiation-sparing alternative to X- Ray. The accuracy of bedside US for diagnosing pneumonia is comparable to X-Ray. However, traditional bedside US suffers the same limitations as X-Rays in terms of portability, and still requires interpretation of images by a trained radiologist. Recent innovations in ultrasound technology and artificial intelligence applications suggest a possible pathway forward. Bluetooth enabled US transponders that connect to a smart phone or tablet, effectively create a truly portable US suite that can fit into one’s pocket. Similarly, advances in artificial intelligence render possible the automated interpretation of mobile bedside US (mBSUS) images on a smart phone, obviating the need for a radiologist. The twin goals of this project are: 1) to compare the accuracy of the mobile, Bluetooth US system, linked to a cell phone, against the gold standard of Chest X-Ray for diagnosis of pneumonia among children aged 1-59 months; and 2) to apply machine learning algorithms to assist in the identification of accurate classification features that reliably identify lobar pneumonia. If successful, this would be a pivotal first step towards the goal of a truly portable yet still highly accurate approach to the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia that could function autonomously without the need for external evaluation by a skilled radiologist. Such a tool would revolutionize pneumonia case management in resource limited parts of the world and could save the lives of many. Project Narrative Pneumonia remains the leading cause of death for children <5 years around the world. A key barrier is the lack of affordable and portable imaging systems. In this project, we will 1) test the accuracy of a mobile ultrasound system that connects to a smart phone via blue tooth against the gold standard of chest X-Ray, and 2) use machine learning algorithms to automate the diagnosis of pneumonia, thereby obviating the need for external review by a radiologist.",Mobile bedside ultrasound for the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia in resource limited settings,10246667,R21TW011343,"['5 year old', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Aorta', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blinded', 'Bluetooth', 'Breast Feeding', 'Breathing', 'Case Management', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest wall structure', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Convulsions', 'Coughing', 'Cyanosis', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Head', 'Heart', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Lethargies', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pediatric Radiologist', 'Pleura', 'Pneumococcal Pneumonia', 'Pneumonia', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Regional Anatomy', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Diaphragm', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Ultrasonography', 'Unconscious State', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vomiting', 'Zambia', 'aged', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'drinking', 'health training', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'low and middle-income countries', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'portability', 'radiologist', 'smartphone Application', 'tool', 'wasting']",FIC,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R21,2020,10065,164685352,-0.02260128479252509
"A Real-Time Computational System for Detecting ARDS Using Ventilator Waveform Data Project Summary:  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe form of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure affecting 10% of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in the United States. In-hospital mortality of 35-46% has been reported across the spectrum of mild-severe ARDS, and one third of patients with initially mild ARDS will progress to moderate or severe ARDS. Over the last 20 years, multiple studies have reported improved outcomes for ARDS patients using specific ARDS targeted therapies. However, ARDS remains persistently under-recognized and challenging to diagnose. Only one third of ICU providers correctly identify ARDS on the first day when diagnostic criteria are met, and less than two thirds ever recognize the diagnosis in the ICU. This under recognition of ARDS may prevent some patients from receiving lifesaving therapies necessary for treating the disease. Attempts to automate ARDS diagnosis using rule- based algorithms have seen limited success, and require analysis of subjective data from patient histories, like chest scans, which limit diagnosis automation, timeliness, and study reproducibility.  To improve the current state of the art of ARDS detection technology, we intend to utilize objective and readily available data including both ventilator waveform data, (VWD) and electronic health record (EMR) data to 1) improve the recognition of ARDS, and 2) identify high-risk ARDS patients most likely to benefit from additional ARDS treatments. For this task, we will make use of an existing dataset of VWD from over 500 patients receiving mechanical ventilation, including 156 patients with confirmed ARDS. Our preliminary analyses using a machine learned model and a subset of lung physiology features derived solely from VWD, suggest that ARDS can be diagnosed in the absence of a chest scan or medical history. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will improve our existing model used for discriminating ARDS by adding objective EMR data, and additional features extracted from VWD, such as patient respiratory compliance and airway resistance. Our next focus will be to predict worsening of ARDS severity in intubated patients based on Berlin criteria. So in Aim 2, we will evaluate the best tools for predicting increases in ARDS severity, and which types of temporal information yield the best predictive results.  We hypothesize that model development using additional objective data derived from VWD analysis and the EMR, along with advanced analytic techniques, will further improve ARDS diagnosis, and enable the prediction of clinical trajectories in patients with ARDS. The proposed work will yield innovative clinical decision support models that can be used to improve the state of the art in automated ARDS diagnosis. Our predictive modeling will also enable greater insight into the times when physicians can perform clinical interventions to arrest ARDS induced physiologic deterioration. Ultimately, these innovations could save lives by quickly detecting ARDS, and alerting physicians to begin or intensify ARDS focused therapies based on patient pathophysiologic state. Project Narrative: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a highly lethal disease contracted by over 100,000 Americans each year. We seek to address whether we can create automated technologies to detect onset and change in severity of ARDS in critically ill patients using widely available ventilator waveform data. With these automated diagnostic testing technologies, doctors can promptly deliver necessary treatments for ARDS before the disease worsens.",A Real-Time Computational System for Detecting ARDS Using Ventilator Waveform Data,9980981,F31HL144028,"['Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Airway Resistance', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automation', 'Berlin', 'Chest', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Contracts', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Model', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hour', 'Hypoxemia', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical History', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States', 'Ventilator', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'deep learning', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'markov model', 'model development', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'recurrent neural network', 'respiratory', 'success', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,F31,2020,15376,254622553,-0.0022304264672789622
"2021 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging SUMMARY This application requests funding to support the 2021 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging, a three- day meeting to be held from February 25-27, 2021, which will be the seventh of its kind hosted by the University of Pennsylvania. The requested funds will primarily be used to cover travel and lodging for junior researchers who will be presenting at the workshop: undergraduate, graduate and junior faculty. Some funds may also be allocated to help pay for live webcasting and publication costs related to workshop materials. As with previous meetings, we intend to stream each session of the meeting in real-time, allowing those who are interested in the proceedings but unable to attend in person to access them online for free. As mortalities associated with pulmonary disease continue to rise worldwide, innovative imaging techniques capable of both diagnosing and helping to treat these pathologies are becoming an increasingly important. As a field, pulmonary imaging currently encompasses a wider range of techniques for the structural, functional and molecular assessment of lung disorders than at any time in its history. What is more, these techniques are being developed and optimized by researchers across an increasingly diverse set of fields such as biology, chemistry, physics, engineering, computer science and medicine. Given the field's rapidly-evolving nature, the existence of a regular forum in which scientists and clinicians can communicate their ideas with each other is of the utmost importance. Given the absence of other scientific meetings with a similarly focused agenda, our previous workshops have succeeded in providing just such a forum—allowing a diverse group of pulmonary imaging researchers to come together for the kind of rigorous, collaborative exchange that can continue to advance the field. The specific aims of the proposed workshop are as follows: (1) host a one-day workshop on pulmonary inflammation; (2) inform the pulmonary imaging community of the latest advances in structural, functional and molecular lung imaging; (3) explore the use of pulmonary imaging to evaluate therapeutic response, the inherent obstacles to doing so, and strategies to overcome them; (4) investigate new approaches for integrating deep learning and pulmonary imaging techniques to more accurately diagnose and phenotype disease and predict injury progression; (5) broadcast the entire workshop live online, thereby enabling interested parties not in attendance to access the proceedings in real-time, free of charge. Based on the uniformly positive feedback in response to our one-day boot camp on pulmonary physiology prior to the 2019 workshop, we intend to hold another boot camp before the 2021 meeting, this time focused on pulmonary inflammation. This boot camp will consist of ~5 longer presentations (approximately 1 hour each) on topics related to this central theme, with significant time devoted to question and answer after each, and a final discussion panel aimed at synthesizing the most important issues covered over the course of the day. In addition to this exciting addition to the format, the 2021 workshop will again seek a more equitable balance between functional, structural and molecular imaging approaches to pulmonary disease across the invited talks, while also continuing to expand our recent focus on the topics of imaging assessments of treatment response and the integration of imaging techniques with machine learning. Finally, the 2021 workshop add a session on bridging the gap between current clinical practice and innovative imaging technologies.

"Leveraging Neural Imaging for Automated Neonatal Infection Diagnosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Post-infectious hydrocephalus (PIH) is a leading cause of neonate mortality in the developing world, but there are limited resources in place for appropriately diagnosing and monitoring the infections that lead to hydrocephalus. There is often a lack of personnel and laboratory resources available for the gathering and processing of lumbar puncture and blood cultures, which are the gold-standard for diagnosing the infectious agents at play in sepsis and PIH. In order to overcome this obstacle, CSF and blood samples were taken from a cohort of septic neonates in Mbale, Uganda, as well as a cohort of neonates and infants who had already progressed to PIH. Cranial ultrasounds (CrUS) were taken from the cohort of septic neonates, and head CT scans were gathered from the PIH cohort. This proposal hypothesizes that the pathogens determined from RNA and DNA sequencing of the blood and CSF samples can be used to train supervised machine learning algorithms to recognize imaging phenotypes characteristic of the underlying pathogen. Therefore, PIH can be prevented by providing pathogen-specific diagnosis and targeted treatment recommendations at the bedside for septic neonates using CrUS. Furthermore, surgical treatment success for PIH can be optimized using CT for the purpose of identifying the underlying pathogen and providing management plan recommendations. This project provides an ideal training environment for a fellow interested in pediatric neurosurgery with a research emphasis on engineering and machine learning applied to image analysis. The interdisciplinary and global nature of the project encourages development of a collaborative and innovative research approach. The home institution of Penn State provides multiple clinical opportunities for growth in pediatric neurosurgery, the MD/PhD program is supportive of truly translational research efforts, and the sponsor and co-sponsor are more than adequately prepared to provide all aspects of training mentorship necessary to accomplish the aims of this project and develop a well-rounded physician-scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Post-infectious hydrocephalus is a devastating condition with a global impact, but diagnostic options and available treatment plans are limited in the developing world in particular. This project aims to design machine learning algorithms that leverage cranial ultrasound and head CT for the diagnosis of pathogen-specific sepsis and hydrocephalus in neonates, and propose treatment paradigms based on the diagnostic output.",Leveraging Neural Imaging for Automated Neonatal Infection Diagnosis,10066656,F30HD102120,"['Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Cauterize', 'Central Nervous System Infections', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Coupled', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Management', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Endocrine', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Human Resources', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Institution', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentorship', 'Microbiology', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Sepsis', 'Shunt Device', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Structure of choroid plexus', 'Survivors', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Uganda', 'Ultrasonography', 'Ventriculostomy', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cerebrospinal fluid flow', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'design', 'diagnosis standard', 'disease classification', 'genome sequencing', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'neonatal infection', 'neonatal sepsis', 'neonate', 'neurosurgery', 'non-invasive imaging', 'optimal treatments', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'septic', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,F30,2020,32183,68045551,0.0028648835347108844
"Abiotic-Biotic Interfaces for Ophthalmology Symposium ABSTRACT This proposal seeks funding to support a symposium, Abiotic-Biotic Interfaces for Ophthalmology (ABI), which will bring together recognized world experts in clinical, research, vision science, engineering, industrial and pharmaceutical communities as well as junior investigators (i.e., young faculty and those in training) to discuss the current state of ABI, ranging from bioelectronic implantable and wearable devices, to nanoscale scaffolds for stem cell and gene therapies. Given the multidisciplinary nature of this field, it is essential to bring together researchers and clinicians with varying levels of expertise across many domains related to ABI to advance the progress of this novel field, identify challenges of advancement, and develop a strategic action plan to overcome these challenges. The timing to have such a symposium to further the application of implantable and/or wearable bioengineered systems in ophthalmology is now as we focus on precision and personalized medicine and leverage the revolution in deep learning artificial intelligence algorithms. Through symposium talks, sessions, and discussions we will cover the fundamentals and also identify innovative and cutting-edge strategies and methodologies to accelerate the rate of major discoveries and development of novel therapeutics. The specific aims of this symposium are: Specific Aim 1. To bring together both established and junior investigators representing a broad range of disciplines to discuss cutting edge research in this novel field, catalyze the development of cross-disciplinary and translational approaches to advance abiotic-biotic interfaces for ophthalmology, and identify gaps in knowledge and barriers to advancement. We will identify research questions and develop an agenda to guide future research that is consistent with the objectives and interests of NEI. Specific Aim 2. Develop a junior investigator program to motivate a diverse group of students and junior investigators to pursue research careers in vision science and ophthalmologic therapeutic development, who will ultimately submit grant proposals to NEI solicitations and contribute to the scientific literature. Specific Aim 3. Develop a strategic action plan to set priorities for future studies that will encourage inter-agency collaborations (e.g., NEI, NSF, DARPA, etc.). This is critical because often certain engineering tasks are best suited to be supported by NSF or DARPA whereas the biological testing of the engineered systems lends itself to funding from NEI. Hence such inter-agency or cross-agency efforts can help leverage the funding to develop sophisticated abiotic-biotic systems NARRATIVE This meeting is the first on this topic dedicated to the broad use of implantable and/or wearable bioelectronics for ophthalmological applications. It is anticipated that the strategic action plan will significantly impact the field by greatly accelerating the translation of basic science and engineering research findings to stimulate the development of novel treatments and improve clinical practice. Key topics include visual restoration, drug and gene delivery, and sensing intraocular pressure. This meeting will foster training and development of future leaders in this emerging field and promote collaboration and exchange of knowledge and ideas among junior and established investigators.",Abiotic-Biotic Interfaces for Ophthalmology Symposium,10070800,R13EY031988,"['Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Testing', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Contact Lenses', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Eye', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Delivery', 'Glass', 'Industrialization', 'Intraocular lens implant device', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Nature', 'Neural Retina', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optics', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Route', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Scientist', 'Senior Scientist', 'Students', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Virtual and Augmented reality', 'Visual', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'gene therapy', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanoscale', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'restoration', 'scaffold', 'stem cell therapy', 'symposium', 'therapeutic development', 'translational approach', 'vision science', 'wearable device']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R13,2020,42465,324592664,-0.007507843464213925
"Modeling and Assessment of Maternal Uteroplacental Circulation During Pregnancy ABSTRACT In this proposal I am interested in developing a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling approach for volumetric assessment of human uteroplacental blood flow in vivo. The placenta is an organ that exchanges nutrients and oxygen between the maternal circulation and the growing fetus. In the United States, about 3.4% of pregnancies per year are affected by hypertensive pregnancy disorders (HPD) such as preeclampsia (PE), which have been found to carry both fetal and maternal risk. Associated placental pathologies are believed to be linked to alterations in maternal arterial remodeling. Currently, Doppler ultrasound (US) is the primary method of assessing flow to the placenta from the uterine artery (UtA). Clinical studies have shown a relationship between high UtA flow resistance and risk of adverse pregnancy outcome late in gestation, but it has not been reliable as an early gestation screening tool. In order to improve predictive technologies for reliable risk assessment assessment of HPD, more research into the relationship between vessel structure and function in the UtA is needed. I hypothesize that CFD modeling can be a useful tool for investigating possible pathophysiological mechanisms of HPD by simulating complex hemodynamics of the maternal vascular system including pressure, wall shear stress, and pulse wave velocity. I plan to set up various 1D CFD simulations to understand the hemodynamic parameters of normal versus abnormal pregnancies. Then, I will validate the simulations with 4D flow MRI acquired from an in vitro flow phantom and a cohort of normal and hypertensive pregnant women. I anticipate that the results of this investigation can advance scientific knowledge regarding the progression of early HPD phenotypes to adverse pregnancy outcomes. This CFD study can also demonstrate the extent to which patient-specific hemodynamic simulations can be reliable for future improvement of clinical management. This training experience will provide opportunities to build my expertise in cardiovascular physiology, fluid mechanics, medical imaging, data analysis, and clinical care. I will be publishing articles on my CFD/4D flow MRI findings and communicating the impact of this work in medicine at various internal and external symposia. This research will be conducted under the mentorship of award-winning experts and the University of Pennsylvania in cardiovascular MRI (Walter Witschey), fluid mechanics and computational modeling (Paris Perdikaris), maternal fetal medicine (Nadav Schwartz) and cardiovascular physiology (Victor Ferrari). PROJECT NARRATIVE The human placenta is an understudied organ believed to play a critical role in pregnancy health and the pathophysiology of hypertensive pregnancy disorders. Current technologies like ultrasound are limited in its ability to assess complex hemodynamics, and clinical studies have not yet found reliable biomarkers of adverse pregnancy outcomes. We will develop a computational fluid dynamic model of the maternal vessels delivering blood to the placenta and validate it with magnetic resonance imaging to characterize uteroplacental structure and function, providing future avenues for new predictive biomarkers of pregnancy health.",Modeling and Assessment of Maternal Uteroplacental Circulation During Pregnancy,9991192,F31HD100171,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists', 'Angiography', 'Arteries', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doppler Ultrasound', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electric Capacitance', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Navier–Stokes equations', 'Nutrient', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Paris, France', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placentation', 'Play', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Training', 'Tube', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Uteroplacental Circulation', 'Uterus', 'Variant', 'Vascular System', 'Velocimetries', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'arterial remodeling', 'base', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'falls', 'fetal', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'maternal risk', 'neural network', 'non-invasive imaging', 'phantom model', 'predictive marker', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pressure', 'screening', 'shear stress', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'symposium', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,45520,593605914,-0.013096891015387788
"MRI and machine learning to improve early prognosis and clinical management after spinal cord injury PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Purpose/Hypothesis: Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes substantial social, economic, and health burden.1 For individuals with motor incomplete SCI, some basic ability to stand or walk is expected during the recovery process,2 and this is a top priority in rehabilitative programs.3 However, establishing a prognosis for recovering community walking ability is extremely difficult.4 Within 72 hours after SCI,5 edema develops within the damaged spinal cord. This edema is a hallmark of spinal cord injury, expressed as signal hyperintensity using T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).6 Correlations between the sagittal length of this spinal cord edema and walking ability are generally poor.7,8 However, advanced but available high resolution axial T2-weighted MRI to quantify spinal cord edema in people in the acute stage of SCI may improve prediction of walking ability.9,10 The early clinical management and targeted rehabilitation of these individuals could be drastically enhanced, optimizing recovery and rehabilitation outcomes. The main objective of this research project is to use early axial spinal cord MRI sequences as neuroprognostic biomarkers to improve the prediction of residual motor function. This objective will be realized by the implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: To establish to what extent the axial damage ratio biomarker, measured by high-resolution axial T2-weighted structural imaging, can predict residual function in persons with SCI. Previously-collected axial T2-weighted spinal cord structural MRI data of 200 people with SCI from the US Model SCI System at Craig Hospital will be used to quantify cord damage. This metric will be related to the primary 1-year status-post injury outcome measures, which are clinical records of walking ability and function. Multivariate statistical analyses will be applied to create exploratory models to determine the prognostic value of the MRI measures. We hypothesize that the axial damage ratio can be used in the acute stage as an accurate and objective neuroprognostic biomarker of residual motor function. Aim 2: To identify the relationship between damage to specific spinal cord regions and specific motor and sensory deficits. MRI data from Aim 1 will be used. Spinal cord regional damage analysis will be related to right and left upper and lower extremity motor and sensory scores. Correlational statistical analyses will be applied to analyze relationships between specific tract damage and motor/sensory deficits. We hypothesize that damage to descending lateral corticospinal motor regions is related to ipsilesional motor deficits, and that similar findings exist for ascending sensory regions and sensory deficits. For both Aims, we will compare our manual damage quantification to our machine learning approach to automatically detect spinal cord damage. Aim 3: Develop, test, and distribute a machine-learning based analysis pipeline for spinal cord damage measures. We will use functions included in the Spinal Cord Toolbox and the open-source NiftyNet deep-learning platform to develop the machine-learning based analysis pipeline. The processing steps will include spinal cord detection, spinal cord damage segmentation, registration to the spinal cord template, and the calculation and output of the axial damage ratio and regional damage biomarkers. Significance: Successful completion of these Aims will advance the NIH/NICHD NCMRR aim: “to enhance the health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of people with physical disabilities.” The significance of this outcome relates directly to improving the clinical management of SCI. This research may inform clinicians, patients, and families, regarding the percentage chance of regaining walking ability. The healthcare team will be able to determine, early-on, which people will optimally respond to locomotor training. This work will significantly improve the prognosis for recovery of walking and specific motor/sensory function based on early imaging of the damaged spinal cord. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this research project is to use early axial MRI measures of spinal cord damage as objective biomarkers to improve the prediction of walking recovery and specific motor return of individuals following SCI. This research will provide patients with a quantified sense of expectations regarding their chances of walking recovery, and will help guide the healthcare team on the best options for clinical management and rehabilitation (i.e. focusing on neuroplasticity and restoration of walking versus compensatory strategies). Ultimately, this research aims to improve the lives and wellbeing of those suffering from spinal cord injury.

"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at a younger age have higher rates of complications than those diagnosed later in life.

"Multi-modal and Extreme PET/MRI Reconstruction Methods Project Summary / Abstract  Hybrid PET/MRI systems are very advantageous for a variety of clinical applications by combining the soft tissue contrast of MRI with the functional and metabolic information of PET. These systems have found success for oncology studies, particularly in head and abdomen/pelvis, as well as for epilepsy, neurological diseases, heart disease, and pediatrics for dose reduction. However, the PET resolution and SNR is typically worse than MRI, and suffers from the loss of feature and data due to motion as well. PET/MRI systems offer the potential to create more accurate, higher resolution PET reconstructions, including correction of artifacts, motion, and im- proved localization, by performing synergistic reconstructions that leverage the simultaneous data acquisition. In particular, this fellowship proposes to develop novel physics-constrained machine learning models for informa- tion sharing between PET and MRI for enhanced spatial localization, estimation of attenuation and activity, and motion. We propose to develop a deep maximum-likelihood estimation of attenuation and activity (MLAA) that can compensate for artifacts and improve PET reconstruction accuracy. We also propose a motion-enhanced joint PET/MRI reconstruction to capture arbitrary motions and reduce dose requirements for chest and abdomen studies. Together, these models aim to improve the PET spatio-temporal resolution, SNR, and quantiﬁcation for a broad range of clinical applications, and will be evaluated for cancer assessment in the pelvis, liver, and lung.  This fellowship will be performed in the Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging at UCSF under the guidance of Prof. Peder Larson, who leads a research program on advanced imaging methods development, and Dr. Thomas Hope, a radiologist and nuclear medicine physician who leads multiple PET/MRI projects. The Department is one of the leading centers in biomedical imaging research, and has been at the forefront on translating PET/MRI systems into clinical practice. The UCSF PET/MRI scanner has dedicated research time, which is also available on other MRI and PET/CT research systems, and extensive computational resources to support the proposed project. The applicant, Dr. Abhejit Rajagopal, has a background in computational imaging and machine learning, will be jointly mentored by this engineer/physician team. He will be trained to become a biomedical imaging scientist by participating in formal coursework on medical imaging systems, training on the PET/MRI system, grant writing, and performing clinical research, supporting his development into a creative, independent biomedical researcher. Project Narrative  Hybrid positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imagery (MRI) imaging systems cur- rently aid in diagnosis and prognosis of numerous types of cancer and disease, but are not always precise enough to accurately measure and track a patient’s response to therapy, particularly in organs and tissue that are sub- ject to motion. There is an unrealized potential here to synergistically combine complimentary PET-MRI data to dramatically improve the spatial resolution and SNR of PET, as well as to create motion-resolved 4D (x,y,z,t) imagery by combining information across modalities and time-frames to combat severe undersampling. These methods will be evaluated in human studies of cancer to capture ﬁne structure and micro-features on moving organs (e.g. lung nodules, liver metastases), ultimately aiding in quantitative characterization of disease.",Multi-modal and Extreme PET/MRI Reconstruction Methods,10069132,F32EB030411,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Chest', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Fellowship', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Implant', 'Joint repair', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metals', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Oncology', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Writing', 'attenuation', 'bioimaging', 'bone', 'cancer type', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'combat', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'heart imaging', 'high resolution imaging', 'imaging modality', 'imaging scientist', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'information model', 'lung imaging', 'method development', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'programs', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'soft tissue', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'systems research', 'uptake']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2020,69426,685608202,-0.004074156438178756
"Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is notoriously difficult to diagnose non-invasively, and current methods of assessing CMD utilize only the peak velocity of the coronary flow pattern. While new imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved the assessment coronary perfusion, there are currently no non-invasive methods that incorporate the coronary flow pattern over a complete cardiac cycle to definitively assess and predict the development of CMD.  Coronary blood flow (CBF) reflects the summation of flow in the coronary microcirculation, and our lab has begun to harness the full CBF pattern under varying flow and disease conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes) to determine whether it might harbor novel clues leading to the early detection of CMD. Our past and preliminary data indicate an early onset of CMD in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that occurs prior to the onset of macrovascular complications and that are characterized by blood flow impairments and alterations in coronary resistance microvessel (CRM) structure, function, and biomechanics. Our data also uncovered innovative correlations between CRM structure/biomechanics and our newly-defined features of the coronary flow pattern, some of which were unique to normal or diabetic mice. We have initially utilized these CBF features, in the presence and absence of other factors such as cardiac function, to develop a mathematical model in collaboration with Drs. Christopher Bartlett and William Ray that to date demonstrated that 6 simple factors can predict a normal vs. diabetic coronary flow pattern with 85% predictive accuracy. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the leading cause of heart disease and is associated with hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMD) is comprised of structural and functional deficits of the tiny coronary arteries that may be an earlier indicator of disease prior to the onset of overt CAD. The proposed multidisciplinary research aims to develop a computational artificial intelligence model that will accurately predict CMD based on a non-invasive coronary flow pattern obtained by Doppler echocardiography.",Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease,10163298,R21EB026518,"['Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic mouse', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doppler Echocardiography', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elements', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperemia', 'Hypertension', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Publications', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'coronary perfusion', 'db/db mouse', 'diabetic', 'disorder prevention', 'early onset', 'experimental study', 'heart function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'macrovascular disease', 'mathematical model', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent']",NIBIB,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R21,2020,75521,43994644,-0.007884959844605605
"Generation of parametric images for FDG PET using dual-time-point scans Project Summary/Abstract Positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET/CT) using the radiolabeled tracer 2- deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) has become a standard imaging tool for cancer patient management. The semi-quantitative parameter standardized uptake value (SUV) is routinely used in clinical for tumor uptake quantification, which is computed on the static PET image acquired at a certain time (typically 60 min) post tracer injection for a short interval (typically 5-15 min). However, the quantification accuracy of SUV from a single PET scan suffers from the variabilities of tracer plasma clearance and acquisition start time. The dual- time-point FDG PET imaging has been intensively investigated and used in both clinical and research studies, typically one scan at 60 min and the other at 120 min, showing the potential to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of FDG PET by differentiating malignancy from inflammation and normal tissue. However, the current clinical dual-time-point FDG PET studies use the relative SUV change between two scans as the quantification index, which cannot eliminate the variations in tracer plasma clearance. Meanwhile, the dual-time-point protocol has not been optimized and standardized currently, leading to conflicting results. The fully-quantitative parameter, tracer net uptake rate constant Ki, is the most accurate parameter to quantify FDG PET, which is calculated using dynamic imaging with compartmental modeling. Ki is independent on the plasma clearance or acquisition start time. However, the long and complex acquisition protocol (typically at least 60 min), which requires dynamic scanning and sequential arterial blood sampling (or image-derived blood activity) used as input function from the time of injection, limits its application in clinical practice. Meanwhile, generation of the parametric Ki image, which can provide additional heterogeneity information for FDG PET, is challenging clinically using voxel-by-voxel compartmental modeling due to the computational cost and being sensitive to noise using non-linear least squares. The graphical Patlak plot, can be used for simplified Ki calculation and Ki image generation by voxel-by-voxel fitting. However, it still needs dynamic scanning starting from 15-30 min after injection and input function from the time of injection. The aims of this proposal are 1) to optimize the dual-time-point protocol for accurate Ki quantification using Patlak plot without the need for individual patient's input function, and 2) to generate high-quality low-noise dual-time-point Ki images using novel techniques based on deep learning. Upon the success of this project, our proposed approach can obtain reliable tumor Ki quantification and parametric Ki image ""for free"" without adding any additional complexity on the existing dual- time-point protocol currently used in clinical practice, with great potential of improving diagnosis and therapy assessment in oncology. We expect the translation of this approach to clinical investigation to be fast, as this is a post-processing approach and is based on data already acquired using clinically used protocol without imposing additional burden to technologists.

"Chronic Inflammation and Type 2 Diabetes: A Multi-omics Approach ABSTRACT The etiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D) likely involves a complex interaction of polygenic, metabolic, and environmental factors including diet. Accumulating experimental, epidemiological, and clinical evidence supports a pathogenic role of chronic inflammation in T2D development. However, the precise mechanisms underlying these findings are largely unknown, and current evidence on the causal relationships between specific inflammatory pathways and T2D risk is inconclusive. Advances in omics technologies have led to the identification of genes and metabolites associated with T2D risk, but data on mechanisms and causality are still very limited. Multi-omics integration in the framework of systems epidemiology may provide new avenues to enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms. To systematically investigate the relation between chronic inflammation and T2D, I propose to examine 3 Specific Aims by leveraging the rich resources in the UK Biobank, Nurses’ Health Studies (NHS), Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (SOL), and Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx). In Aim 1 [K99], I will integrate existing genomic data from the UK Biobank, NHS/HPFS, SOL, and transcriptomic data in the GTEx to examine shared genetic architectures between systemic inflammatory markers and T2D and whether polygenic susceptibility to chronic inflammation confers T2D risk. Meanwhile, I will receive extensive training in T2D systems biology and cutting-edge high-dimensional data analytics and bioinformatics. In Aim 2 [R00], I will integrate dietary and metabolomic data to examine metabolomic profiles mediating the association between dietary inflammatory potentials and T2D risk in the prospective NHS/HPFS and the SOL. In Aim 3 [R00], I will conduct plasma proteomic profiling in a nested case-control study within the NHS to identify inflammatory protein networks in relation to T2D risk, and as a Secondary Aim, integrate findings from Aim 1-3 to explore T2D-related pathways co-regulating at multiple biological dimensions. Findings from this project may improve the understanding of inflammatory mechanisms underlying T2D and identify novel targets/pathways suitable for early detection and prevention. I will be mentored/advised by an interdisciplinary team that includes Dr. JoAnn Manson (diabetes epidemiologist), Dr. Liming Liang (expert in statistical omics methodologies), Dr. Frank Hu (nutritional epidemiologist), Dr. Peter Kraft, (statistical geneticist), Dr. Qibin Qi (genetic epidemiologist), Dr. Towia Libermann (expert in proteomics), and Dr. Clary Clish (expert in metabolomics). The outstanding training opportunities with key leaders in these areas will provide me advanced knowledge and skills, positioning me for a successful, independent career as a diabetes epidemiologist with expertise in systems biology and integrated-omics. This project aligns with the NIDDK’s goal of integrating multi-omics technologies into diabetes research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to systematically examine the relationship between chronic inflammation and type 2 diabetes (T2D) by incorporating multi-omics data from several large prospective cohort studies. The proposed research will yield novel evidence on the biological mechanisms underlying the relationship between chronic inflammation and T2D risk.

"DUET: Rapid dual-mode microscopy for quantitative slide-based renal fibrosis evaluation Contact PD/PI: Fereidouni, Farzad Abstract Kidneys, like other organs, have an inherent capacity to recover from acute injury; however, severe or recurrent injury can result in chronic kidney disease (CKD), the sequelae of which result in 82,000 deaths annually in the US alone. Regardless of the etiology of the initial injury, the common final pathway leading to- end stage renal disease is closely connected to fibrosis(excess or aberrant collagen distribution), one of the most important determinants of renal disease severity and prognosis. Histology is the gold standard for evaluation, typically through the use of histochemical stains such as trichrome and PAS that highlight the presence of collagens and basement membrane, respectively. Nevertheless, these stains are not completely specific, can be technically challenging to perform well and reproducibly, and thus contribute to interobserver variability and a concomitant decrease in diagnostic precision. Moreover, they also require the preparation of extra slides and additional staining procedures, and thus increase cost and can prolong the diagnostic process. We propose to optimize, deploy and test a new kind of microscope, DUET (DUal mode Emission and Transmission microscopy), developed at UC Davis, that will be a low-cost and very rapid solution for detection and digital characterization of the presence and distribution of collagen and other macromolecules, directly from standard formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides. Specifically, we will finalize the design of the hardware and software components of the instrument itself, validate imaging performance against standard histology and immunohistochemical stains for collagen and other components, and with the assistance of scientists at our partnering institutions (John Hopkins University and University of Buffalo) develop robust tools for analysis and quantitation of fibrosis. DUET instrument hardware will be shared with JHU to ensure that the methods are technically reproducible across multiple sites. The application leverages the expertise across three institutions in optics, biomedical engineering, renal pathology and novel artificial intelligence approaches. The goal of the project is development and validation of DUET, which promises to be a robust, inexpensive and practical approach for the rapid and accurate evaluation of fibrosis, extensible to other renal pathologies, and indeed across other organs systems, with significant positive impact on disease research, clinical practice, and patient outcomes. Page 6 Project Summary/Abstract Project Narrative Evaluation of fibrosis and tubular atrophy from chemically stained kidney biopsies are essential for diagnosis and disease-severity assessment, but current techniques are time-consuming, somewhat non-specific and contribute to interobserver variability and imprecision, affecting care. We propose to optimize and test a new kind of microscope (“DUET”) that can visualize fibrosis (scarring) and other tissue abnormalities directly from standard slides to enable high-quality reproducible fibrosis scoring and evaluation. This multi-site project will also provide a unique opportunity to perform a retrospective study from hundreds of existing H&E slides with associated months to years of clinical follow-up data, and to create a method with demonstrated utility in more than one institution.",DUET: Rapid dual-mode microscopy for quantitative slide-based renal fibrosis evaluation,10261643,R56DK124873,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Allografting', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrophic', 'Basement membrane', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biopsy', 'Buffaloes', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Collagen', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fibrillar Collagen', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence', 'Formalin', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Natural History', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Recurrence', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sirius Red F3B', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissues', 'Trichrome stain method', 'Tubular formation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'body system', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'follow-up', 'histological stains', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney fibrosis', 'macromolecule', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized diagnostics', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'software development', 'stem', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R56,2020,91725,254622553,0.0010193093304434809
"Integrative data science approaches for rare disease discovery in health records ABSTRACT: There are nearly 7,000 diseases that have a prevalence of only one in 2,000 individuals or less. Yet, such rare diseases are estimated to collectively affect over 300 million people worldwide, representing a significant healthcare concern. Although rare diseases have predominantly genetic origins, nearly half of them do not manifest symptoms until adulthood and frequently confound discovery and diagnosis. Even in the case of early onset disorders, the sheer number of possible diagnoses can often overwhelm clinicians. As a result, rare diseases are often diagnosed with delay, misdiagnosed or even remain undiagnosed, not only disrupting patient lives but also hindering progress on our understanding of such diseases. Data science methods that mine large-scale retrospective health record data for phenotypic information will aid in timely and accurate diagnoses of rare diseases, especially when combined with additional data types, thus, having significant real- world impact. This proposal will integrate electronic health record (EHR) data sets with publicly available vocabularies and ontologies, and genomic data for the improved identification and characterization of patients with rare diseases, using approaches from machine learning, natural language processing (NLP) and basic bioinformatics. The work has three specific aims and will be carried out in two phases. During the mentored phase, the principal investigator (PI) will develop data-driven methods to extract standardized concepts related to rare diseases from clinical notes and infer the occurrence of each disease (Aim 1). He will also develop data science approaches to compare and contrast longitudinal patterns associated with patients' journeys through the healthcare system when seeking a diagnosis for a rare disease, and aid in clinical decision-making by leveraging these patterns (Aim 2). During the independent phase (Aim 3), computational methods will be developed for the integrated modeling and analysis of genotypic (from Aim 3) and phenotypic information (from Aims 1 and 2). Cohorts to be sequenced will cover diseases for which causal genes or disease definitions are unclear (discovery), as well as those for which these are well known (validation). This work will be carried out under the mentorship of four faculty members with complementary expertise in biomedical informatics, data science, NLP, and rare disease genomics at the University of Washington, the largest medical system in the Pacific Northwest (four million EHRs), world-renowned researchers in medical genetics, and a robust data science environment. In addition, under the direction of the mentoring team, the PI will complete advanced coursework, receive training in translational bioinformatics and clinical research informatics, submit manuscripts, and seek an independent research position. This proposal will yield preliminary results for subsequent studies on data-driven phenotyping and enable the realization of the PI's career goals by providing him with the necessary training to build on his machine learning and basic bioinformatics expertise to transition into an independent investigator in biomedical data science. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare genetic diseases are estimated to affect the lives of 25 to 30 million Americans and their families, and present a significant economic burden on the healthcare system. Currently, our knowledge of the broad spectrum of the 7,000 observed rare diseases is limited to a few well-studied ones, hindering our ability to make correct and timely diagnoses. The objective of this study is to improve the identification of patients with rare diseases in healthcare systems by developing data science approaches that automatically recognize rare disease-related patterns in patient health records and correlate them with genomic data, thus, aiding in diagnosis and discovery.",Integrative data science approaches for rare disease discovery in health records,9884791,K99LM012992,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Markov Chains', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pacific Northwest', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Rare Diseases', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'Washington', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'causal variant', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease phenotype', 'early onset disorder', 'exome sequencing', 'gene discovery', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'health record', 'improved', 'member', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient health information', 'phenotypic data', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'rare condition', 'rare genetic disorder', 'recruit', 'skills', 'software development', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trait']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2020,92070,533302350,-0.017331962271252273

Research plan: The research goal of my proposed K99/R00 grant is to increase the re-use of computable biomedical knowledge, which is knowledge represented in computer-interpretable formalisms such as Bayesian networks and neural networks. I refer to such representations as models. Although models can be re-used in toto in another setting, there may be loss of performance or, even more problematically, fundamental mismatches between the data required by the model and the data available in the new setting making their re-use impossible. The field of transfer learning develops algorithms for transferring knowledge from one setting to another. Transfer learning, a sub-area of machine learning, explicitly distinguishes between a source setting, which has the model that we would like to re-use, and a target setting, which has data insufficient for deriving a model from data and therefore needs to re-use a model from a source setting. I propose to develop and evaluate several Bayesian Network Transfer Learning (BN- TL) algorithms and a Convolutional Neural Network Transfer Learning algorithm. My specific research aims are to: (1) further develop and evaluate BN-TL for sharing computable knowledge across healthcare settings; (2) develop and evaluate BN-TL for updating computable knowledge over time; and (3) develop and evaluate a deep transfer learning algorithm that combines knowledge in heterogeneous scenarios. I will do this research on models that are used to automatically detect cases of infectious disease such as influenza. Impact: The proposed research takes advantage of large datasets that I previously developed; therefore I expect to quickly have results with immediate implications for how case detection models are shared from a region that is initially experiencing an epidemic to another location that wishes to have optimal case-detection capability as early as possible. More generally, it will bring insight into machine learning enhanced biomedical knowledge sharing and updating. This training grant will prepare me to work independently and lead efforts to develop computational solutions to meet biomedical needs in future R01 projects. Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge Narrative Re-using computable biomedical knowledge in the form of a mathematical model in a new setting is challenging because the new setting may not have data needed as inputs to the model. This project will develop and evaluate transfer learning algorithms, which are computer programs that adapt a model to a new setting by removing and adding local variables to it. The developed methods for re-using models are expected to benefit the public’s health by: (1) improving case detection during epidemics by enabling re-use of automatic case detectors developed in the earliest affected regions with other regions, and, more generally, (2) increasing the impact of NIH’s investment in machine learning by enabling machine-learned models to be used in more institutions and locations.",Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge,9952803,K99LM013383,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Big Data', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Influenza', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Parainfluenza', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'computer program', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'detector', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'skills', 'statistics', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K99,2020,92359,570146095,-0.005504322183679354
"Real-time Non-Rigid 3D Reconstruction and Registration for Laparoscopic-guided Minimally Invasive Liver Surgery Project Summary/Abstract Liver deformation leads to difficulties in tumor localization during minimally invasive liver surgery (MILS). The goal of this proposal is to develop an efficient surgical navigation tool for MILS by compensating for liver deformation and mapping preoperative data to the patient’s anatomy. Specifically, we will develop a non-rigid simultaneously localization and mapping (SLAM) approach to estimate the deformation of liver surface from stereo laparoscopy videos. We will develop machine-learning methods to detect landmarks and perform non- rigid registration. The algorithms will be implemented on a GPU to achieve real-time. Preliminary data has demonstrated the feasibility. During the R00 phase, we will mainly address the clinical needs and develop novel ways to provide intraoperative guidance. This project will greatly improve the tumor resection accuracy in MILS.

"Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection Abstract PET is a molecular imaging modality widely used in oncology studies due to its high sensitivity and the potential of early diagnosis. For neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), 68Ga-DOTATATE PET has been recently used in clinical routine for imaging NETs in adult and pediatric patients since 2016. It plays an important role in the diagnosis and staging of NETs. However, compared to 18F-FDG PET, the image quality of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is lower due to much larger positron range, shorter half-life, and lower dose administration limited by generator capacity. All of these compromises the lesion detectability of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET, especially for small lesions, and can potentially lead to inaccurate NET diagnosis. As 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is increasingly used in clinics, there is an urgent and unmet need to further optimize 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging for NET detection. Recently, data-driven methods have been developed for PET image denoising, where the PET system model is not considered. As the tumor-to-background ratio of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is greater than 18F-FDG PET, the lesion recovery of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET can be hugely influenced by the smoothing effects as well as potential mismatches between training and testing datasets. In this study, we propose a novel data- informed and lesion detection-driven image reconstruction framework. The PET system model, image denoising module, and lesion-detection module will all be included in this reconstruction framework. The two specific aims of this exploratory proposal are (1) to develop a lesion detection-driven PET image reconstruction framework and validate it based on comprehensive computer simulations, (2) to apply the proposed reconstruction framework to existing clinical 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT datasets and test it based on various figure-of-merits. We expect that the integrated outcome of the specific aims will be a novel and robust image reconstruction framework to better recover lesions in a 68Ga- DOTATATE PET scan, which is essential for NET managements. Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection  Project Narrative Positron emission tomography (PET) is an imaging modality widely used in oncology. This project aims to develop a novel lesion detection-driven PET image reconstruction framework. Success of this project can enhance the lesion detectability of current PET imaging protocols, e.g. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT scanning for neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).",Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection,10041119,R03EB030280,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Biological Models', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Gallium', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Injections', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors', 'Noise', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Positron', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Reader', 'Recovery', 'Recurrence', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer type', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'effectiveness validation', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'molecular imaging', 'neural network', 'neuroendocrine differentiation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pediatric patients', 'pentetreotide', 'radiologist', 'radiotracer', 'reconstruction', 'routine imaging', 'success', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2020,94255,551214295,-0.021731997981207892
"Lupus Nephritis Neural Network, LuNN Up to 60% of adults and 80% of children with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) develop nephritis (LN), with 10–30% progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The gold standard for diagnosis of LN is a renal biopsy. Histological parameters remain the best predictors of ESRD. Despite being the gold standard, histological diagnosis of LN has several shortcomings. In multiple inter-observer renal pathology assessment studies reported thus far, the inter- pathologist correlation coefficients, or concordance, in assessing most histological parameters have been sub-optimal. This has provided the impetus for the current proposal. We propose to leverage the power of computer vision and deep learning to build a classifier that rivals the best-trained renal pathologists in making a histological diagnosis of LN using current diagnostic criteria. We propose to train a deep convolutional neural network to distinguish the different LN classes, and to identify a full spectrum of histological attributes useful for diagnosis. We will compare the performance of the newly generated neural network in scoring glomerular/tubulo-interstitial features and LN classes, against a panel of human renal pathologists. Finally, we propose to build a neural network that can predict clinical outcome based on baseline renal pathology. Reliable and reproducible classification of LN could dramatically improve patient management and long-term renal and patient survival. Despite being the gold standard, histological diagnosis of lupus nephritis is imprecise, and marked by significant inter-pathologist discordance in readings.

"Fast motion-robust fetal neuroimaging with MRI PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Fetal-brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an invaluable tool for studying the early development of the brain and can resolve diagnostic ambiguities that may remain after routine ultrasound exams. Unfortunately, high levels of fetal and maternal motion (1) limit fetal MRI to rapid two-dimensional (2D) sequences and frequently introduce dramatic artifacts such as (2) image misorientation relative to the standard sagittal, coronal, axial planes needed for clinical assessment and (3) partial to complete signal loss. These factors lead to the inefficient practice of repeating ~30 s stack-of-slices acquisitions until motion-free images have been obtained. Throughout the session, technologists manually adjust the orientation of scans in response to motion, and about 38% of datasets are typically discarded. Thus, subject motion is the fundamental impediment to reaping the full benefits of MRI for answering clinical and investigational questions in the fetus. The overarching goal of this project is to overcome the challenges posed by motion by exploiting innovations in deep learning, which have enabled image-analysis algorithms with unprecedented speed and reliability. We propose to integrate these into the MRI acquisition pipeline to unlock the potential of fetal MRI. We will develop practical pulse-sequence technology for automated and dynamically motion-corrected fetal neuroimaging without the need for external hardware or calibration. We hypothesize that this will radically improve the quality and success rates of clinical and research studies, while dramatically reducing patient discomfort and cost. We propose as Aim 1 to eradicate (2) the vulnerability of acquisitions to image-brain misorientation with rapid, automated prescription of standard anatomical planes. In Aim 2, we propose to address (3) motion during the scan with real-time correction of fetal-head motion. An anatomical stack-of-slices acquisition will be interleaved with volumetric navigators. These will be used to measure motion as it happens in the scanner and to adaptively update the slice tilt/position. We propose as Aim 3 to develop a 3D radial sequence and estimate motion between subsets of radial spokes for real-time self-navigation. Adaptively updating the orientation of spokes and selectively re-acquiring corrupted subsets at the end of the scan will enable 3D imaging of the fetal brain (1). Since the applicant has a physics background, the proposed training program at MIT and HMS will focus on deep learning and fetal development/neuroscience during the K99 phase to develop the skills needed for transitioning to independence in the R00 phase. The applicant’s goal is to become a fetal image acquisition and analysis scientist acting as bridge between deep learning, MRI and clinical fetal-imaging applications to shift the boundaries of what is currently possible with state-of-the-art technology. Fulfilling the research aims will promote this, as it will result in a practical framework for automation and motion correction, applicable to a wide variety of fetal neuroimaging sequences. PROJECT NARRATIVE Subject motion is the fundamental impediment to reaping the full benefits of fetal-brain magnetic resonance imaging, as it frequently produces images with dramatic artifacts. The goal of this project is to exploit innovations in deep learning and integrate them into the acquisition pipeline to overcome the challenges posed by motion in fetal neuroimaging studies. This will be achieved by using fast, automated scan prescription of standard anatomical planes and by adaptively updating the acquisition as motion happens in the scanner, based on sub-second navigator scans interleaved with the imaging sequence.",Fast motion-robust fetal neuroimaging with MRI,9950474,K99HD101553,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Amniotic Fluid', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Calibration', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Radial', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'echo detection', 'experience', 'fetal', 'image archival system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'repaired', 'research study', 'response', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NICHD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K99,2020,108601,551214295,-0.013345282972727803
"Artificial Intelligence-Based Approaches for Renal Structure Characterization in Computed Tomography Images ABSTRACT The goal of this R03 Small Grant Program for NIDDK is to provide additional funding for Dr. Kline to expand upon his work on his K award and apply his expertise to new image acquisitions and problems related to renal imaging. Dr. Kline’s work has piqued the interest of many internal and external investigators and has led to recent collaborations with Drs. Rule, Denic, and Kim. Together with Dr. Erickson, this new research team has prepared this R03 proposal which takes advantage of the unique expertise of each team member. The focus of this proposal is to bridge the gap between microscopic observations and those assessable non-invasively by radiological imaging. To do this, we have established a unique dataset of renal CT imaging data and corresponding biopsy measured nephron densities. We have also generated a large database of gold-standard segmentation data of kidneys, cortical regions, and medullary pyramids. Using this existing data, we propose to: (i) develop tools for segmentation of kidneys, segmentation of individual medullary pyramids, and imputing missing parts of the kidneys outside of the imaged field-of-view in the CT image, and (ii) to establish imaging biomarkers of early CKD, and correlate macroscopic imaging findings to underlying microscopic structure. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic’s outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Aging Kidney Anatomy Study (PI: Rule), which led to the generation of this unique and well characterized dataset. Dr. Kline’s background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly well suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, near the end of this research project Dr. Kline will submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of renal imaging biomarkers. Obtaining this R03 Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline’s transition into a prosperous independent researcher focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. Narrative Non-invasive methods for characterizing micro-structural changes of the kidney during aging as well as in health and disease are currently not possible. This research program proposes to use our existing database of renal imaging and renal biopsy data to bridge the gap between macroscopic radiological findings on computed tomography images to those assessable in microscopic images of renal biopsies. This program will develop new automated methods for performing measurements on the images, as well as use machine/deep learning methods to search for new imaging biomarkers that relate to nephron density and size, as well as establish their usefulness for early chronic kidney disease detection and transplant planning.",Artificial Intelligence-Based Approaches for Renal Structure Characterization in Computed Tomography Images,10040835,R03DK125632,"['Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Albuminuria', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Award', 'Biopsy', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hepatic Cyst', 'Hour', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nephrons', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Radiologic Finding', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Stenosis', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Tubular formation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated analysis', 'automated image analysis', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'density', 'early detection biomarkers', 'graft failure', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'interstitial', 'kidney biopsy', 'learning strategy', 'living kidney donor', 'member', 'microscopic imaging', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel imaging technology', 'personalized decision', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'radiological imaging', 'research clinical testing', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R03,2020,113350,276703803,0.009283932987620078
"Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging and automated textural radiomics for assessment of human placenta accreta spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY  Placenta Accreta Spectrum (PAS) disorder is a condition in which the placenta fails to separate partially or totally from the uterine wall, resulting in significant intrapartum maternal morbidity and mortality at delivery. Depending on the extent of the placental invasion into surrounding tissue, hysterectomy may be lifesaving. Assessment of PAS severity prior to delivery is crucial for multidisciplinary surgical planning and patient counseling. However, there is an unmet clinical need for quantitative, objective measures of abnormal placentation that can serve as predictors of risk of invasion and hysterectomy. The overall goal of the proposed project is to prospectively assess PAS in high-risk women across gestation using quantitative multi-parametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and automated textural radiomics and to correlate findings with surgical outcomes.  Coming from a highly interdisciplinary background of MR chemistry, biology, and physics, the candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator with in-depth knowledge and skills to conduct translational placental imaging research. The candidate's short-term goal is to complete a pilot study under the mentorship of an interdisciplinary advisory committee to evaluate PAS in women with high-risk pregnancies using multi-parametric MRI and textural radiomics.  To meet these goals, the following research aims are proposed: 1) Evaluate placental invasion across gestation using multi-parametric MR imaging and deep learning based novel quantification tools in PAS high- risk pregnancies, and 2) Extract the radiomic pattern across gestation of high-risk PAS placenta and determine its association with clinical surgical outcome. These research aims will serve as the platform for the career development plan and training aims which include: 1) Gain knowledge in translational prospective research design, 2) Improve technical skills in advanced clinical MR acquisition development, 3) Acquire applied statistical and data analysis skills, and 4) Develop mentorship and leadership skills while under training.  Together, the research and training aims will provide the training, experience and preliminary data for an R01 application. The future R01 will develop a clinical and surgical outcome prediction model for high-risk PAS pregnancies, potentially improving maternal and fetal outcomes. The training will position the candidate to become a leader in translational placental imaging research. PROJECT NARRATIVE After a woman has had a cesarean delivery, if the placenta implants on the surgical scar in a subsequent pregnancy, there is a risk for invasion, referred to as placenta accreta spectrum (PAS); depending on its severity, a cesarean hysterectomy may be required with significant morbidity. Imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance (MR) imaging have shown promise in defining characteristics that alert the obstetrician to the severity of PAS. We will explore the vascularity and tissue characteristics of the placenta with MRI and identify quantitative predictive markers of disease severity and hope to better understand the pathophysiology of placenta accreta spectrum.",Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging and automated textural radiomics for assessment of human placenta accreta spectrum,10105139,K25HD104004,"['Abnormal placentation', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cellularity', 'Cesarean section', 'Characteristics', 'Chemistry', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Risk Woman', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Human', 'Hysterectomy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Perinatal', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Accreta', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Spin Labels', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uterus', 'Visualization', 'Woman', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'fetal', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'implantation', 'improved', 'interest', 'intrapartum', 'maternal morbidity', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'recruit', 'skills', 'soft tissue', 'surgery outcome', 'tool']",NICHD,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,K25,2020,114184,225463847,-0.008894397585477685
"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life. This research will also provide quantitative outcome measures that may be used in future clinical trials.",Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS,9963329,K01HD088762,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Equilibrium', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'FXTAS', 'Family', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuroepidemiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Posture', 'Predictive Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'data management', 'design', 'disability', 'disabling symptom', 'epidemiology study', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'gait examination', 'improved', 'instrument', 'male', 'men', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sex']",NICHD,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2020,128408,55098220,-0.007462296008268733
"Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records Project Summary A key aim of this proposal is to equip the candidate, Dr.Ozrazgat Baslanti, with the necessary protected time and additional training and resources to develop her skillset on quantitative methods and understanding of underlying mechanism of progression of kidney disease and facilitate her transition to an independent translational researcher in health care. The long-term career goal is to become an independent data scientist, with a focus on hospital care for acute disease and complications arising from that care. The overall objective of this application is to build the foundation of the analytical approach for identifying patients’ health trajectories during episode of acute hospitalization and quantifying the transitions in health states that can be applied to any acute illness. Our central hypothesis is that using kidney health as a paradigm for this approach we can determine individual states of change in kidney health during hospitalization using longitudinal, highly granular temporal data in electronic health records, determine transition probabilities to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease, and improve understanding of the underlying processes influencing these transitions. Current diagnosis and risk evaluation for acute kidney injury (AKI) are focused on determination of severity of AKI episode and an integrated framework for assessing renal recovery does not exist. There is a clear lack of research on estimating transition probabilities among different states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using longitudinal electronic health records data. The complexity of underlying processes influencing the transition probabilities from renal risk to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease requires application of advanced computational models in sufficiently large and granular datasets. The specific aims of the proposal are: Aim 1- Expand and validate computable phenotypes of kidney health in large-scale medical data. Aim 2- Determine the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of changes in kidney health. Aim 3- Develop and validate probabilistic graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health and identify risk factors for progression. The proposed research is significant as we will have phenotyping algorithms of kidney health, validated in multi-center study, that can enhance their inter-institutional sharing and that enable to study epidemiology and outcomes of changes in kidney health. The approach is innovative because it implements technological advances in data science and statistics in innovative steps to develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm that determines computable phenotypes of changes in kidney health and graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using highly granular electronic health records. This will provide foundation for changes in the care of patients with AKI, through identification of those patients at risk of developing AKI and progressing to acute and chronic kidney disease. On completion of the proposed investigations the deliverables will be new knowledge and a diagnosis and prognostication tool for kidney health. Project Narrative Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common complication among hospitalized patients and is central to the subsequent development of chronic kidney disease and increased mortality. Besides the severity of an initial episode of acute kidney injury, the timing and duration of renal recovery are required to characterize the natural history of this complex condition and its effect on overall kidney health. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help to enhance health, since our research may provide diagnosis and prediction tools for changes in kidney health using electronic records data that contain wealth of clinical data that could be used to identify all dimensions of AKI episode as well as key determinants of undesired outcomes.",Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records,9891542,K01DK120784,"['Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Network', 'Caring', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Preventive therapy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'acute care', 'adjudication', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'computable phenotypes', 'data warehouse', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prognostic tool', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational scientist']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2020,130488,188894159,-0.0032752121682430024
"Advancing Ulcerative Colitis Monitoring with Deep Learning Models Project Summary/Abstract The number of practicing pathologists around the world is expected to decrease by as much as 30% over the next two decades, with some of the world’s poorest countries having a ratio of only one pathologist to many hundreds of thousands of people. At the same time, the diagnostic caseload that requires their expertise in clinical trials and hospital settings will continue to grow. The digitization of pathology data, coupled with the use of machine learning techniques for analyzing and scoring the data, provides exciting opportunities to make the field of pathology more efficient and scalable, even as the workforce continues to evolve. Deep learning in particular provides the potential to enhance the interpretation of medical images by improving the detection of image-based biomarkers for a broad range of diseases. Image interpretation plays an important role in patient eligibility and endpoint determination during the course of clinical trials. For patients with ulcerative colitis, the development of trained and reliable algorithms that can help pathologists identify disease progression and response to treatment in a timely and effective manner can provide benefit in two important ways. First, it will help to ensure that the most appropriate score for histological disease severity is being assigned to each image using the Robarts Histopathology Index (RHI) or similar grading scale. Second, it will support a triage process by which images known to contain non- healthy tissues can be prioritized for earlier assessment. Through a unique partnership between Azavea, a geospatial technology and machine learning firm, and Robarts, a clinical trials organization, the proposed research will begin to address these needs by developing deep learning algorithms for histopathology digital image analysis, testing them on machine-readable annotations of medical imagery from previous clinical studies, and exposing them through a metadata- searchable interface that will enable the images to be categorized and quickly accessed by pathologists and others to support reader training and increase communication between multiple readers and sites. In so doing, it will not only help streamline the evaluation of new ulcerative colitis treatments that rely heavily on the image interpretation process, but also provide the foundation for the identification of additional components present in other gastrointestinal disease indications in the future. Project Narrative The proposed research will contribute critical new insights on the reliability, sensitivity, and practicality of machine learning to support gastrointestinal disease detection and evaluation in a clinical trials setting. In pathology, where manual interpretation of images using a microscope has remained relatively unchanged for decades, machine learning provides particular potential to improve the speed and accuracy of diagnoses by reducing the subjectivity that is often inherent in the process.",Advancing Ulcerative Colitis Monitoring with Deep Learning Models,10081185,R43EB030441,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Endoscopy', 'Endpoint Determination', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning Skill', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Readability', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Series', 'Services', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Software Design', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Triage', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Validation', 'base', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'gastrointestinal', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging detection', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'learning network', 'prototype', 'software development', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIBIB,"AZAVEA, INC",R43,2020,150000,150000,-0.01878273177389041
"WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNDIAGNOSED DISEASES NETWORK CLINICAL SITE 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure. Finally, WUSM will make a clear institutional commitment to maintain its Clinical Site, to adapt UDN Phase I practices for sustainability, to contribute to formation of a sustainable national UDN resource, and to adapt to unique needs and unexpected circumstances that may arise once Common Fund support ends in fiscal year 2022. 2.0 PROJECT NARRATIVE Undiagnosed diseases in children and adults represent frustrating and costly challenges for patients, families, physicians, and society. Building on established institutional infrastructure similar to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) will establish a UDN Clinical Site to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases, facilitate research into the etiology of undiagnosed diseases, and promote an integrated and collaborative community across multiple UDN Clinical Sites, Sequencing Cores, Model Organisms Screening Centers, and among laboratory and clinical investigators. Specifically, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will annually recruit, select, evaluate, and follow 30 participants with disorders in any clinical specialty, adult and pediatric, provide comprehensive clinical evaluations that require <5 days and follow up, and participate in all UDN protocols, data management and sharing, and sustainability planning.",WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNDIAGNOSED DISEASES NETWORK CLINICAL SITE,10124937,U01HG010215,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accreditation', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Consent', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Physicians', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Secure', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data dissemination', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'network models', 'operation', 'outreach', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'student training', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,150000,533594881,-0.003027232731578353
"Bioethics of syndrome diagnosis using 3D image analysis Project Summary/Abstract This supplement will address the unintended consequences and collateral damage that arise when facial recognition software is used for medical purposes, such as for syndrome diagnosis as in our Facebase-funded project. In Aim 1, we will determine whether the accuracy of this technology varies based on self-reported race, sex and age. In this aim, we examine our existing database for evidence of bias based on self-reported race, sex or age. We further determine the extent to which these variables influence classification performance. To the extent sample sizes allow, we will carry this analysis to the level of specific syndromes. Finally, we will use anonymized reference datasets of non-syndromic faces to compare false positive rates based on NIH race definitions, sex and age. The outcome of this aim is to objectively establish bias and estimate the effects of under-representation across race, age and sex categories within our data. In Aim 2, we will determine how the reports of race-, sex- and age-based bias in facial recognition technology may influence views of the technology and its application amongst researchers and clinicians. This aim will establish the extent to which the storing of large databases of facial images and the application of machine learning processes to them for diagnostic purposes may raise privacy concerns. The concerns investigated will include potential hacks into protected health information; fear relating to the bias in some facial recognition software (and, potentially, in the Facebase database); and fear of discrimination in the application of the technology, such as by insurers. The outcome will be a white paper that targets a high-profile journal, summarizing the findings and defining crucial issues that should guide the development of facial imaging for disease diagnosis and clinical usage. Project Narrative Our supplement application will address the important question of unintended consequences and collateral damage when facial recognition software is used for medical purposes, such as for syndrome diagnosis as in our Facebase-funded project. The use of large facial recognition databases in medicine represents a frontier that arrives with tremendous potential but undeniable risks. Our central aims are: (1) determine whether the accuracy of this technology varies based on self-reported race, sex and age; and (2) determine how the reports of race-, sex- and age-based bias in facial recognition technology may influence views of the technology and its application amongst researchers and clinicians.",Bioethics of syndrome diagnosis using 3D image analysis,10132648,U01DE028729,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Age', 'Authoritarianism', 'Bioethical Issues', 'Bioethics', 'Biometry', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Computational Biology', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'FaceBase', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Journals', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient imaging', 'Performance', 'Privacy', 'Private Sector', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Sector', 'Race', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'Secure', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'craniofacial', 'disease diagnosis', 'facial recognition software', 'frontier', 'human data', 'intervention cost', 'new technology', 'professor', 'repository', 'sex', 'tool']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,U01,2020,152200,324592664,-0.004093011409797913
"Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD ABSTRACT The goal of this NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to provide an organized scientific and educational environment for Dr. Timothy Kline to begin his transition into an independent research career focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. This proposal outlines a five-year training plan at Mayo Clinic under the primary mentorship of Dr. Bradley Erickson and a Mentoring Team comprised of accomplished researchers in the fields of: biology, nephrology, genetics, radiology, informatics; medical physics, biostatistics, image processing, and physiology. The focus of this proposal is to improve both research studies and disease prognosis for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients through biomedical imaging techniques. It is well understood that imaging is essential for ADPKD diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome prediction. Clinical studies utilize total kidney volume (TKV) (as measured by MRI as an image-based biomarker) to follow the progression of ADPKD, as larger TKVs have been shown to correlate with worse prognosis in both human and animal-model studies. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming, costly, and poorly standardized. The introduction of automated approaches for measuring TKV will: greatly improve measurement throughput, significantly reduce costs associated with performing research studies, allow accurate and reproducible measurements to be obtained both within and across institutions; facilitate the search for new imaging biomarkers. The specific aims of this project are to: (i) develop and validate automated tools to characterize renal structure, such as TKV and cystic burden; (ii) explore new imaging biomarkers by image texture feature analysis and pattern recognition techniques; and (iii) develop a new technique to measure renal blood flow. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic's outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Mayo Clinic Translational PKD Center, which focuses on translating basic science research into improvements in the management and treatment of ADPKD patients. Dr. Kline's background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, Dr. Kline will: 1) develop a strong knowledge base in both nephrology and radiology by attending relevant rounds, seminars, and national conferences; 2) enhance his knowledge of medical imaging, biology, physiology, genetics, and programming through coursework and mentoring; 3) attend workshops focused on grant and publication writing; and 4) submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of new imaging biomarkers of ADPKD. Obtaining this K Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline's transition into a prosperous independent research career. Narrative Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders and is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Total kidney volume (TKV) has become the main image-based biomarker for following ADPKD progression. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming and costly. This project will develop automated tools to increase measurement throughput, and explore new image-based biomarkers that will significantly add to the assessment of patient prognosis, and will have the ability to more quickly judge the effectiveness of interventions.",Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD,10011565,K01DK110136,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood Vessels', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Consumption', 'Cyst', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'FarGo', 'Fibrosis', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hepatic Cyst', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Microscopic', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nephrology', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Renal Tissue', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Spin Labels', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Writing', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disease diagnosis', 'educational atmosphere', 'functional decline', 'human model', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'kidney vascular structure', 'knowledge base', 'novel imaging technology', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'prognostic value', 'radiological imaging', 'renal artery', 'research study', 'shear stress', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K01,2020,154915,276703803,0.01798212775064522
"Understanding Inflammatory Arthritis due to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors Project Summary/Abstract The major goals of this proposal are to attain skills required to be an independent clinical and translational researcher in rheumatology and to enhance understanding of a new rheumatic disease, inflammatory arthritis (IA) due to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). ICIs are revolutionizing cancer treatment but also cause immune related adverse events. ICI-induced IA is the immune related adverse event most likely to be encountered by rheumatologists. ICI-induced IA causes significant morbidity, is clinically heterogeneous, and can persist after ICI cessation. The proposed project will utilize a group of well characterized patients with ICI- induced IA and ICI-treated control patients who do not develop IA to address several important questions. First, the clinical heterogeneity within ICI-induced IA will be evaluated and factors that predict persistence of IA beyond cessation of ICI therapy will be established. Next, clinical and immunogenetic risk factors for developing ICI-induced IA will be determined. Finally, serum cytokine profiles and autoantibodies before and after ICI treatment will be compared in patients with ICI-induced IA and control patients who are treated with ICIs and do not develop IA. These experiments will address key knowledge gaps for this emerging clinical entity. Specifically, defining relevant clinical subgroups will allow for differential monitoring and treatment of patients. Understanding risk factors for development of IA will allow for risk stratification of patients prior to therapy. Cytokines that are elevated in ICI-induced IA patient sera could serve as future therapeutic targets. Finally, understanding presence of autoantibodies and when they develop in the course of ICI treatment will give insight into pathogenesis and identify potential biomarkers. Concurrently with conducting research during the proposal, the candidate will participate in a variety of career development activities taking advantage of the rich resources of Johns Hopkins in the Division of Rheumatology, the Bloomberg Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, and the Bloomberg School of Public Health. The candidate will participate in didactic coursework, conferences, and mentoring meetings with a diverse group of mentors from rheumatology, oncology, laboratory science, and data science. At the end of this award, the candidate will be an independent clinical investigator in the area of cancer immunotherapy and autoimmune disease and will establish a multi- center consortium with standardized data and biospecimen collection for rheumatic irAEs and for patients with preexisting autoimmune disease who are treated with ICIs. Project Narrative This project addresses an increasingly prevalent health condition, inflammatory arthritis due to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy for cancer. The proposal will allow for improved diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced inflammatory arthritis.

"West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification Project Summary – Overall West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) The West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) is committed to the overall goals of the NIH Common Fund Metabolomics Initiative and specifically aims to largely improve small molecule identifications. Understanding metabolism is important to gain insight into biochemical processes and relevant to battle diseases such as cancer, obesity and diabetes. Compound identification in metabolomics is still a daunting task with many unknown compounds and false positive identifications. The major goal of the WCMC is therefore to develop processes and resources that accelerate and improve the accuracy of the compound identification workflow for experts and medical professionals. The WCMC for Compound Identification is structured in three different entities: the Administrative Core, the Computational Core and the Experimental Core. The Center is led by the Director Prof. Fiehn in close collaboration with quantum chemistry experts Prof. Wang and Prof. Tantillo, and metabolomics experts Dr. Barupal and Dr. Kind with broad support from mass spectrometry, computational metabolomics and programming experts. The Administrative Core will assist the Computational and Experimental Core to develop and validate large in-silico mass spectral libraries, retention time prediction models and innovative methods for constraining and ranking lists of isomers in an integrated process of cheminformatics tools and databases. The developed tools and databases will be made available to all Common Fund Metabolomics Consortium (CF-MC) members and professional working groups. The WCMC will also provide guidance for compound identification to the National Metabolomics Data Repository. The broad dissemination of developed compound identification protocols, training for compound identification workflows, databases and distribution of internal reference standard kits for metabolomic standardization will overall widely support the metabolomics community.

"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs. The proposed novel approaches are expected to advance precision medicine approaches to SUDs by enabling treatment matching and a more refined SUD classification to gene finding.",Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data,9851853,K02DA043063,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurobiology', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol use disorder', 'biomarker performance', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cocaine use', 'contingency management', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'genetic association', 'genomic data', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'opioid use disorder', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,K02,2020,161422,36067938,-0.035659782620202654
"The gut-lung axis influences the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia This proposal presents a five-year research career development program focused on gut fungal commensal ecology, the mycobiome, in the neonatal period to advance mechanistic understanding of the gut-lung axis in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). This research development plan is designed to provide the candidate, an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics and neonatologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, with the mentorship, training and research experience required to accelerate his development into an independent clinician scientist in neonatal mucosal immunology. To achieve the candidate’s long-term goal of leading a productive translational research program focused on understanding mucosal immunology in BPD and facilitate his transition to independence, the candidate and his established mentors have devised a comprehensive development plan based on: 1) intensive, personal mentorship from a team with a proven history of productive mentoring; 2) in-depth experiential and focused didactic training to advance his understanding of molecular mycology, gnotobiotics and clinical research methods; and 3) an innovative research plan to produce causal evidence for gut mycobiome involvement in BPD development. The candidate’s research development plan outlines a focused path to obtain the knowledge, skills and experience required to accelerate his development into an independent clinician scientist who will have a lasting impact on neonatal mucosal immunology.  BPD is the most serious pulmonary complication of preterm birth. Treatments to modify developmental risk factors for BPD are lacking. Neonatal models of the gut-lung axis in other lung diseases, epidemiological studies linking antibiotic exposure with increased risk of BPD development, and the candidate’s extensive preliminary studies in mice and preterm newborns strongly suggest the gut mycobiome represents a therapeutic target to influence BPD development. This proposal builds on the candidate’s prior experience and the expertise of his mentors to explore the mechanisms of the neonatal gut-lung axis. We will test two hypotheses. 1) Prenatal antibiotic exposure-induced mycobiome changes drive increased BPD severity by disrupting the gut-lung axis. 2) Colonization with commensal fungi favorably alters the pulmonary mucosal immune response to hyperoxia. Determining if disruption of intestinal commensal microbial communities contributes to the development of lung injury in BPD will inform the development of therapeutics for mitigating BPD. These studies are expected to lay the groundwork translational studies in human preterm newborns. PROJECT NARRATIVE Bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a devastating chronic lung disease with debilitating long-term consequences, affects approximately half of all infants born extremely preterm. The objectives of this proposal are relevant to public health because they aim to establish that bacterial communities in the gut influence development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia by altering the immune responses of the developing lung. Successful completion of this proposal will provide insight into extra-pulmonary contributions to lung development and characterize new targets for therapy, which addresses goals of the NIH to seek mechanistic understanding of the microbiome in the pathobiology of lung diseases and reduce the incidence of chronic lung disease during early life.",The gut-lung axis influences the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia,9952647,K08HL151907,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alabama', 'Antibiotics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia', 'Cell Wall', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complication', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Education', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Feces', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hyperoxia', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Lymphoid Cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mucosal Immune Responses', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Newborn Infant', 'Pediatrics', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Pulmonary Inflammation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'The science of Mycology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'career development', 'critical developmental period', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'fungus', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'gut-lung axis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interstitial', 'lung development', 'lung injury', 'member', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiome components', 'microbiome composition', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mycobiome', 'neonatal period', 'neonate', 'new therapeutic target', 'pneumonia model', 'pre-clinical', 'prenatal', 'preterm newborn', 'professor', 'protective effect', 'pulmonary function', 'research and development', 'respiratory microbiome', 'screening', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'translational research program', 'translational study']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,K08,2020,165456,325573502,-0.03553179868555157
"Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning RESEARCH SUMMARY The goal of this award is to provide Andrew Beam, PhD with research support and comprehensive mentoring designed to transition him to an independent investigator in perinatal and neonatal informatics. Preterm labor (PTL) is labor which occurs before 37 weeks of gestation and carries with it enormous health and financial consequences. Preterm infants have some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity, yet machine-learning techniques for these important outcomes remains under developed. The research strategy is focused developing predictive models for two very important clinical scenarios using large sources of existing healthcare data. The focus of Specific Aim 1 develops a new form of machine learning known as deep learning for predicting PTL in pregnant women, while the focus of Specific Aim 2 investigates the use of deep learning for predicting clinical trajectories of preterm infants in the NICU. Currently, management and anticipation of both clinical scenarios is challenging and advancement in our predictive capacity could dramatically improve the quality and efficiency of the healthcare system. These models will be built using an existing database of 50 million patient-lives obtained through a partnership with a major US health insurer. Specific Aim 3 seeks to understand how the models constructed using this unique data resource translate and generalize to data from the electronic health records of Boston-area hospitals, which is a key concern for all healthcare data scientists. The education plan focuses on augmenting Dr. Beam’s graduate degrees in statistics and bioinformatics with additional training in clinical medicine and human pathology. This additional education will grant Dr. Beam a deeper understanding of the clinical problems faced by these populations and will allow for more fluid collaborations with clinicians in the future. The composition of Dr. Beam’s mentorship committee, which includes expertise in neonatology, biostatistics, and translational informatics, reflects his long-term desire to be quantitative scientist who works side-by-side practicing physicians so that quantitative research is translated into impactful clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infants born prematurely experience some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity and are among the most expensive patients in all of pediatrics. Now, with the availability of large sources of healthcare data from insurance claims databases and electronic health records, there is an opportunity to better understand prematurity and its predictors using computational techniques. We propose leveraging state of the art deep learning models built using data from hospitals and insurers to both predict which pregnancies will result in preterm birth and to predict which preterm infants will experience severe cardiac and pulmonary morbidity.",Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning,9850130,K01HL141771,"['37 weeks gestation', 'Accounting', 'Acute Disease', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Boston', 'Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia', 'Cardiac', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Technique', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Graduate Degree', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitals', 'Human Pathology', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Informatics', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neonatology', 'Outcome', 'Patent Ductus Arteriosus', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Perinatal', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Premature Labor', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Rest', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'education planning', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'improved', 'insurance claims', 'mortality', 'peer', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'respiratory distress syndrome', 'social', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'structured data']",NHLBI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K01,2020,166320,146629556,-0.0023368100035086933
"Refining repeat screening for coronary artery disease in kidney transplant candidates 7. Project Summary This K23 proposal will provide Xingxing S. Cheng, MD, MS with the protected time, mentorship, training, and research experience to become an independent clinical investigator. Dr. Cheng is a board-certified nephrologist and accredited transplant nephrologist, with a long-term vision of improving the effectiveness of health care for kidney transplant patients. She seeks to combine patient-oriented research and decision science to find innovative solutions to clinical problems. Skills she will acquire in this grant, under the guidance of a strong mentorship team, include 1) integration of patient-oriented research and decision analytic models; 2) assessing the heterogeneity of response in different patient subgroups; and 3) advanced modelling skills. This grant proposes to refine the process of screening of coronary artery disease in patients with chronic kidney disease on the wait-list awaiting kidney transplantation. Currently, patients undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, few of which result in interventions. These tests impose a high treatment burden on patients and potentially delay time to transplant, while bringing unclear benefit to the patient. This grant proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients with diabetes mellitus). It will examine strategies that vary the frequency of cardiac testing and risk stratification for cardiac testing based on a simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive test that can be performed in routine clinical settings, a 6-minute walk test (6MWT). This project will achieve this broad aim by three specific aims: 1) to characterize the 6MWT in identifying low-risk patients who do not additional cardiac testing; 2) to model strategies varying the frequency of cardiac testing and use of 6MWT; 3) to design strategies personalized for specific patient subgroups and model them in the entire kidney transplant candidate population of the United States (US). The first two aims will arise from a well-characterized cohort of patients at Dr. Cheng’s institution. Machine-learning systems will be used to identify which patient subgroups are best served by which strategies (i.e. the heterogeneity of response). The third aim will leverage the US Renal Data System, which Dr. Cheng’s mentors and institution has a track record of leveraging for innovative research. The proposed work has high potential to make a significant clinical impact. Its completion will enable the identification and characterization of rational strategies for pre-transplant screening of coronary artery disease that may be incorporated into clinical practice or pave the way for a future multi-center comparative effectiveness trial. The proposed work is realistic and feasible within the award period, and will allow Dr. Cheng to build research skills, advance and disseminate scientific knowledge, create additional collaborative networks, and compete for R01 or equivalent funding. In summary, the K23 award will provide the support to enable Dr. Cheng to become a successful independent clinical investigator. 8. Project Narrative Currently, patients on the kidney transplant waitlist undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, but relatively few interventions result. This project proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients without diabetes mellitus), by examining strategies that reduce the frequency of cardiac testing and use performance-based risk stratification to reduce the number of patients who need cardiac testing. If successful, this project will reduce the cardiac testing burden and facilitate activation for transplant for patients on the kidney transplant waitlist.",Refining repeat screening for coronary artery disease in kidney transplant candidates,9871208,K23DK123410,"['Accreditation', 'Age', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Information Systems', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Science', 'Specificity', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Wait Time', 'Waiting Lists', 'Walking', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness trial', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'fitness', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'older patient', 'patient oriented research', 'patient subsets', 'personalized strategies', 'predictive test', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relative effectiveness', 'response', 'screening', 'skills']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,166536,560644462,-0.002356686964091171
"Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm PROJECT SUMMARY The development of large observational health databases (OHD) has expanded the data available for analysis by pharmacoepidemiology research. The efficiency of these studies may be improved by simultaneously studying the association of multiple medications with a disease of interest. Unfortunately, prior research has demonstrated that it is difficult to distinguish true-positive from false-positive results when studying multiple exposures simultaneously, thus limiting the conclusions drawn from these types of studies and representing a major gap in the field. The objective of this proposal, which is the first step in achieving the applicant's long- term goal of improving the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases using insights derived from OHD, is to evaluate and validate medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA), a novel set-based signal-to- noise enrichment algorithm developed by the applicant to analyze multiple exposures from OHD with high sensitivity and specificity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that MCEA has equal sensitivity and greater specificity compared to logistic regression, the most widely used analytic method for OHD, for identifying true associations between medications and clinical outcomes. The applicant will complete the following two interrelated specific aims to test the hypothesis: Aim 1 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA) and logistic regression (LR) for identifying medication associations with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and Aim 2 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of MCEA and LR for identifying medication associations with gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GIH). The rationale for these aims is that by reproducing known medication-disease associations without false positives, MCEA can be used to identify novel pharmacologic associations with gastrointestinal diseases in future studies. The expected outcome for the proposed research is that it will demonstrate MCEA as a valid method for pharmacoepidemiology research, opening new research opportunities for the study of multi-exposure OHD. These new research opportunities may lead to more rapid identification of potential pharmacologic causes of emerging diseases and discovery of unanticipated beneficial medication effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications. To attain the expected outcome, the applicant will complete additional coursework that builds on his Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology to learn computational biology, machine learning, and econometrics techniques. With the support of this grant and his institution, he will also directly apply these techniques to pharmacoepidemiology applications under the close mentorship of a carefully selected team of faculty with extensive experience in gastroenterology, pharmacoepidemiology, medical informatics, and mentoring prior K-award grant recipients. Through these activities, the applicant will develop the skills necessary to obtain NIH R01-level funding and become a leader in developing novel techniques for application to the epidemiologic study of gastrointestinal diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traditionally, research studying medications associated with diseases are limited to analyzing one medication at a time. This novel proposal will validate medication class enrichment analysis, a recently developed algorithm to study multiple medications simultaneously for association with a disease of interest. Validation of this method will allow researchers to use existing medical databases to more rapidly identify potential medication causes of emerging diseases and identify medications with unanticipated beneficial effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications.",Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm,9853783,K08DK119475,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Aminoglycosides', 'Antibiotics', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Carbapenems', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cephalosporins', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Outcome', 'Penicillins', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'analytical method', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'career development', 'clinical epidemiology', 'econometrics', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'research study', 'simulation', 'skills', 'usability']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2020,167900,593605914,-0.0072310404921737395
"The Utah-Cohort Of Postnatally persistent Antenatal Hydronephrosis (U-COPAH) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The candidate for this K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award aims to become an international leader in the development, dissemination, and implementation of novel health care interventions and management strategies for pediatric urologic disease, with an initial focus on hydronephrosis that is diagnosed in utero but that persists after birth, or postnatally persistent hydronephrosis (PNH). The proposed mentored research and career development plan lays the foundation for this career and the eventual development of a standardized management strategy for PNH by generating the evidence needed to support its development and creating an ultrasound (U/S) grading tool needed to implement it in routine clinical practice. Kidney U/Ss are the main test to monitor PNH, but U/S reports are heterogeneously formatted and contain synonymous and ambiguous terms that complicate their interpretation. Another major obstacle in the field is a need to predict those at risk for worsening disease and to better understand the natural history of PNH. Aim 1 will develop a Natural Language Processing algorithm to automatically translate free-text U/S reports into structured data providing the PNH grade. Aim 2 will use baseline U/S and renal scan data to predict the PNH grade at 2 years. Aim 3 will use growth curves to simulate PNH’s natural history and provide the time and frequency of disease resolution/improvement, stability, and progression. The candidate brings to this proposal experience as a pediatric urological surgeon at a large tertiary care children’s hospital and core research skills in epidemiology and biostatistics. An integral part of his career development will be a continued relationship with an outstanding multidisciplinary mentoring team with complementary strengths. The candidate’s primary mentor is Rachel Hess, MD, MS. Dr. Hess is a world renown expert in implementing interventions in routine clinical care and has an exemplary track record of mentorship. Flory Nkoy, MD, MS, MPH, the candidate’s co-mentor, is an expert in bioinformatics and internationally recognized for developing, disseminating, and implementing pioneering approaches to treat chronic disease in children. Advisors include Jeffrey Ferraro, PhD, and Wendy Chapman, PhD (bioinformatics), Angela Presson, PhD (biostatistics), Patrick Cartwright, MD (pediatric urology), and Mark Ebert, MD (pediatric radiology). The proposed research and training plan will establish the candidate’s solid foundation in bioinformatics, augment his prior epidemiology and biostatistics training, and provide extraordinary training in dissemination and implementation science. This will provide him with the skills and experience necessary for a career as a successful independent researcher focused on developing, implementing, and disseminating novel management strategies for pediatric urologic disease, with an initial focus on hydronephrosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Hydronephrosis diagnosed in utero but persisting after birth (PNH) affects tens of thousands of infants each year in the United States, but its management is complicated by ambiguous reporting of hydronephrosis severity and a relatively limited understanding of predictors of disease outcome and knowledge of the disease’s natural history. The proposed research uses the largest known pediatric hydronephrosis cohort to develop a tool to translates free-text ultrasound reports into coded PNH grades, predict the 2-year outcome using 3-month baseline data, and apply sophisticated modeling techniques to simulate the disease’s natural history. Taken together, results from this proposal will lead to the development of a standardized management strategy for PNH and facilitate the candidate’s transition to an independent research career in the development, dissemination, and implementation of novel treatment and management strategies for pediatric urologic disease, beginning with pediatric hydronephrosis.",The Utah-Cohort Of Postnatally persistent Antenatal Hydronephrosis (U-COPAH),9892829,K08DK119535,"['2 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hydronephrosis', 'Image', 'Infant', 'International', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Manuals', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Obstruction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Radiology', 'Performance', 'Predictive Factor', 'Pregnancy', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Renal function', 'Renal pelvis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Selection Bias', 'Severities', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urologic Surgeon', 'Urology', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'antenatal', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disease natural history', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'in utero diagnosis', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatrician', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prognostic', 'research and development', 'skills', 'structured data', 'support tools', 'tertiary care', 'tool', 'urinary', 'urologic']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K08,2020,168411,228951281,-0.011642106849369895
"SURPASS: (Statin Use and Risk Prediction of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in minority Subgroups) PROJECT SUMMARY Despite advances in technology, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death, disability, and healthcare costs in the U.S. Yet, there is a tremendous gap in accurate cardiovascular risk prediction and prevention, particularly in racial/ethnic minorities. Furthermore, there is significant heterogeneity in CVD risks and outcomes for disaggregated Hispanic and Asian subgroups. The current cardiovascular risk assessment tools have not been well-validated in these diverse populations, and it remains largely unknown why minority patients are less likely to start and more likely to stop life-saving therapies. The overall goal of Dr. Rodriguez’s K01 application is to address gaps in knowledge about CVD prediction and treatment in understudied racial/ethnic minority populations. The proposed study will utilize the electronic health record (EHR) data from an established NHLBI-funded cohort enriched with disaggregated Hispanic and Asian patients. Using this cohort, Dr. Rodriguez will first test the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations in disaggregated Asian and Hispanic subgroups using a large diverse mixed-payer cohort of 1,234,751 patients from two large healthcare systems in Northern California and Hawaii. Secondly, she will build new CVD risk prediction models for diverse patient subgroups using machine learning techniques. Finally, she will identify reasons for statin underuse and discontinuation using natural language processing in the EHR. This study, which will evaluate existing data from real-world clinical practice in a stable population, will inform future risk prediction models and cholesterol treatment guidelines for diverse racial/ethnic groups. The proposal is aligned with the NHBLI’s strategic goals to eliminate health disparities and inequities by leveraging epidemiology and data science to understand and solve complex health problems. This proposal will also prepare Dr. Rodriguez to meet her long-term goal of becoming a national leader and independent investigator in CVD prevention and minority health. The proposed didactic and applied data science experiences, including training in advanced epidemiological methods and machine learning, will prepare Dr. Rodriguez to apply her research to other areas of CVD prevention and populations. This training program builds on the strengths of Stanford University in health services research, epidemiology, and biomedical informatics. Her mentorship team, led by Dr. Latha Palaniappan, includes experts in cardiovascular prevention and health services research (Dr. Heidenreich, co-mentor), applied statistical analyses (Dr. Robert Tibshirani, advisor), machine learning in the EHR (Dr. Nigam Shah, advisor), and chronic disease prediction and medical decision making (Dr. Michael Pignone, advisor). Dr. Rodriguez’s team is committed to ensuring the success of the proposal as well as overseeing her advanced training in their respective areas of expertise. The research and training plan proposed in this K01 application will develop Dr. Rodriguez into a unique and highly-skilled clinician researcher ready to compete for R-level funding and launch her independent research career. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for racial/ethnic minority groups in the U.S., yet current CVD risk prediction algorithms fail to adequately assess risk in these populations. The proposal will address this substantial knowledge gap by validating current risk prediction models in racial/ethnic minority subgroups, improving risk prediction using modern machine learning techniques, and identifying reasons for statin discontinuation. Findings from this study will provide the foundation for clinical guidelines, research agendas, and public health interventions to improve CVD prevention strategies in diverse populations. !",SURPASS: (Statin Use and Risk Prediction of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in minority Subgroups),9851429,K01HL144607,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Area', 'Asians', 'Assessment tool', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biometry', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Outcome', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Mexican Americans', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Puerto Rican', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'South Asian', 'Stable Populations', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Woman', 'Work', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'college', 'disability', 'disparity reduction', 'epidemiologic data', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health difference', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'i(19)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'minority health', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'patient subsets', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevention service', 'public health intervention', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'random forest', 'risk prediction model', 'side effect', 'skills', 'structured data', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'support vector machine', 'treatment guidelines', 'unstructured data']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,172001,560644462,-0.01731884597476482
"Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Michael Mathis is a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist with board certification in anesthesiology and advanced perioperative echocardiography at the University of Michigan. Through completion of a T32 Research Training Grant, Dr. Mathis has developed expertise in perioperative outcomes research for patients with advanced cardiovascular disease. His long-term career goal is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF) through harnessing perioperative electronic healthcare record (EHR) data for early diagnosis and management. This proposal builds on Dr. Mathis's expertise, providing protected time for training in data science methods necessary to drive forward the analytic techniques proposed for improving HF diagnosis. Environment: The University of Michigan is the coordinating center for the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG), an international consortium of over 50 anesthesiology and surgical departments with perioperative information systems. Dr. Sachin Kheterpal, MD, MBA is the primary mentor for Dr. Mathis, and is the Director for MPOG and member of the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative Advisory Panel. The proposed research will be completed under the guidance of Dr. Kheterpal, as well as co-mentors Milo Engoren, MD, Daniel Clauw, MD, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD. An advisory panel of experts in HF diagnosis and data science methodologies will provide Dr. Mathis with additional guidance. Background: HF is among the most common chronic conditions requiring hospitalization and carries high rates of mortality. In the perioperative period, HF is a risk factor for major cardiac complications. Despite advances in care, little progress has been made to reduce HF healthcare burden, with difficulties attributable to a lack of inexpensive, reliable diagnostic measures. Consequently, patients with HF can go unrecognized in early stages and do not receive treatments to reduce mortality. The perioperative period is an underutilized opportunity to improve HF diagnosis. Beyond the wealth of preoperative data available, the intraoperative period serves as a cardiac stress test through which hemodynamic responses to surgical and anesthetic stimuli are recorded with high resolution. Yet, this data remains an untapped resource for HF evaluation. Research: The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate the perioperative period as an opportunity for early diagnosis of HF. The two specific Aims are to develop a data-driven diagnostic algorithm for HF using preoperative EHR data (Aim 1) as well as intraoperative EHR data (Aim 2). Both aims will use automated techniques to extract features of HF from the perioperative EHR, developed at UM and scalable to multiple centers via the MPOG infrastructure. This work represents a paradigm shift in perioperative evaluation, using perioperative data as a diagnostic tool rather than a risk-assessment tool. The proposed research and training will provide Dr. Mathis with necessary data science computational experience to become an independent physician-investigator focused on improving perioperative management strategies for patients with HF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Public Health Relevance Statement: Heart failure is a common chronic condition affecting over 550,000 patients each year, with a 45–60% mortality rate at 5 years. Despite advances in treatment, little progress has been made to improve heart failure diagnosis, and thus patients in early heart failure stages do not receive appropriate life-extending therapies. Through robust data science methodologies, this study harnesses critically underutilized, high-fidelity data available during the perioperative period to improve diagnosis of heart failure .",Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach,9895469,K01HL141701,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Assessment tool', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Board Certification', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Science', 'Consumption', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intraoperative Period', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methodological Studies', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'blood pressure variability', 'care providers', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stressor', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2020,172274,641965656,-0.010036955932585127
"The Role of the Microbiome in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K23 proposal will complete Robert Dickson, MD's training towards his long-term career goal of improving our understanding and treatment of lung disease by investigation of the microbiome. Dr. Dickson is a Pulmonary and Critical Care physician and scientist at the University of Michigan with established success in the burgeoning field of lung microbiome studies. This proposal builds on Dr. Dickson's previously acquired expertise in pulmonary pathophysiology and microbial ecology with new training in clinical research methods and computational biology. These established and newly-acquired skills will be integrated to improve our understanding of the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). This research will be conducted under the guidance of primary mentor Gary B. Huffnagle PhD, co- mentor Theodore J. Standiford MD and an advisory board of accomplished investigators with expertise in clinical research methods, computational biology and lung immunology as well as extensive mentoring success. This 5-year plan includes formal coursework, professional development, and progressively independent research, with defined milestones to ensure productivity and a successful transition to independence. The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expense, responsible for an estimated 74,500 U.S. deaths per year. Numerous studies have identified indirect evidence of translocation of bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the lung in patients at risk for ARDS, but to date no study has evaluated the role of microbiome in the pathogenesis of ARDS. This proposal will test the hypothesis that translocation of gut bacteria to the lung provokes the inflammation and injury of ARDS via two specific Scientific Aims. Aim 1 will determine if translocation of enteric bacteria to the lung microbiome precedes the clinical development of ARDS, and Aim 2 will determine the temporal relationship between respiratory dysbiosis, host inflammation and the clinical onset of ARDS. Inherent to completing these high-level aims, Dr. Dickson will execute a prospective cohort study of patients at high risk for ARDS, utilize modern culture-independent techniques of bacterial identification to describe the bacterial communities in the lungs and gastrointestinal tracts of high-risk patients, and apply novel techniques of advanced computational modeling to the complex nonlinear system of ARDS pathogenesis. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: 1) to determine if the lung microbiome contributes to disease progression among patients with established ARDS and 2) to determine if the lung microbiome can be therapeutically manipulated in critically ill patients to prevent or modulate respiratory disease. n addition to building a foundation for a programmatic line of research to understand the role of the microbiome in lung disease, this proposal will provide Dr. Dickson with research skills applicable to additional domains of human microbiome and ARDS research. This K23 award will equip Dr. Dickson to establish himself as an independent investigator and international leader in this promising field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expense, responsible for an estimated 74,500 U.S. deaths per year; the National Institutes of Health have identified the prevention and early treatment of ARDS as a research priority. We lack an understanding of the pathogenesis of ARDS, impeding our ability to predict and prevent its onset. Determination of the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of ARDS would both 1) improve our ability to predict the onset of ARDS, enabling targeted preventive interventions and 2) identify novel therapeutic targets at the microbiome/host interface in patients at risk for ARDS.",The Role of the Microbiome in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,9852338,K23HL130641,"['Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Alveolar', 'Bacteria', 'Catecholamines', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Culture-independent methods', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early treatment', 'Ecology', 'Ensure', 'Enterobacter', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Epinephrine', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gammaproteobacteria', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immigration', 'Immunology', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Non-linear Models', 'Norepinephrine', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Pseudomonas', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'bacterial community', 'bacteriome', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical development', 'clinical risk', 'cytokine', 'dysbiosis', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal bacteria', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'host microbiome', 'improved', 'indexing', 'lung microbiome', 'lung microbiota', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'mortality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'respiratory microbiome', 'skills', 'spatiotemporal', 'success']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2020,172800,641965656,0.006429732484210478
"Improving cancer family history collection through social networking and artificial intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY  The  activities  proposed  in  this  NCI  K07  application  are  designed  to  advance  the  career  development  and  research  independence  of  Dr.  Brandon  M.  Welch.  Family  health  history  (FHx)  is  one  of  the most important  resources available to help clinicians identify disease risks. By knowing a patient's FHx, clinicians can quickly  identify  disease risks and initiate risk-reducing strategies such as increased screening, prophylactic surgery,  risk-reducing  therapeutics,  and  lifestyle  changes.  FHx  is  also  the  foundation  of  genomic  medicine.  Unfortunately,  the  collection  and  use  of  FHx  by  patients  and  clinicians  is  suboptimal.  To  improve  the  collection and use of FHx among the general population, a better FHx tool that is easier and more convenient  to  use  than  current  FHx  tools  is  needed.  A  new  FHx  web  tool,  called  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com,​  incorporates  artificial intelligence and social networking to improve user engagement with FHx collection.Utilizing artificial  intelligence  based  chat  entity  can  improve  the  collection  of  FHx  information  by  making  it  easier  and  more  engaging to record FHx information, likewise social networking allows users to tap into the collective wisdom  and  knowledge  of  the  family  to  correct  inaccuracies  and  overcome  gaps  in  FHx  knowledge.  This research  study  will  first  identify  enhancements  to  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com  ​that  will  further  promote  user  engagement,  with  particular  focus  on  rural and underserved patients (Aim 1). We will then evaluate whether this new FHx  tool can improve collection of cancer FHx in comparison with current FHx tools (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess  the impact of ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com ​on the clinical settings (Aim 3). To implement the research plan, it will be  critical  to  apply,  skills  obtained  through  K  award  learning  objectives,  namely  clinical  oncology  (learning  objective  1),  iterative  patient-centered  design  (learning  objective  2),  and  health  technology  assessment  (learning  objective  3).  To  fulfill  these  learning  objectives,  an  interdisciplinary  group  of  mentors  will  direct  a  comprehensive training plan. The training plan includes coursework, seminars, workshops, journal clubs, and  conferences,  covering clinical oncology, patient engagement, health disparities, user-centered development,  human-computer  interaction,  clinical  research  methodologies,  health  technology  assessment,  and  ethical  conduct  of  research.  The  strong  support  of  an  excellent  team  of  mentors,  and  the  vast  resources  of  the  Medical  University  of  South  Carolina,  create  an  optimal  training  environment.  Collectively,  the  integrated  learning  objectives  and  research  plan  are  critical  to  establishing  a  successful,  innovative,  and  meaningful  academic career focused on developing patient-centric informatics tools for oncology.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Family health history (FHx) is one of the most important risk factors for cancer and the foundation of genomic medicine, but is under-utilized by patients and clinicians.

"Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches Candidate: Dr. Tedeschi is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Associate Physician in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy’s Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). She received an MPH from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her 10 first-author manuscripts, two BWH grants, and foundation award exemplify her productivity and commitment to research. She has assembled an experienced team of mentors and collaborators, led by Dr. Daniel Solomon (primary mentor) and Drs. Katherine Liao and Karen Costenbader (co-mentors), to guide her training in natural language processing and machine learning approaches for clinical research, analysis of linked electronic medical record (EMR) and Medicare claims data, and interpretation of advanced imaging modalities. Focused coursework at HSPH and HMS will complement the experience she gains through her proposed studies of pseudogout risk factors and long-term outcomes. Training in dual- energy CT and ultrasound interpretation for crystalline arthritis will be obtained via one-on-one sessions. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator focused on pseudogout. Environment: Dr. Tedeschi has a commitment from her Division for >75% protected time for research and career development activities during the K23 award period. Support from the Division and her primary mentor’s research funds will supplement her salary and project-related expenses. The SCS, a collaborative clinical research group in the Division of Rheumatology, has extensive infrastructure including the VERITY Bioinformatics Core (NIH-P30-AR072577, PI: Solomon) that will provide resources and expertise for the proposed studies. In addition, the BWH Arthritis Center is one of the largest nationally, facilitating subject recruitment, and the BWH Division of Musculoskeletal Imaging has state-of-the-art equipment and expertise applying dual-energy CT in crystalline arthritis. Coursework at HSPH and HMS, adjacent to BWH, will provide training necessary for Dr. Tedeschi’s development into an independent investigator. Research: Dr. Tedeschi’s long-term objective is to prevent and reduce morbidity from pseudogout, an understudied, painful crystalline arthritis that affects 8-10 million Americans. She will use natural language processing and machine learning approaches to enhance an algorithm for identifying pseudogout in EMR data. She will study risk factors for and long-term outcomes in pseudogout, harnessing vast amounts of information contained in Partners HealthCare EMR data and Medicare claims data, and will gain experience working with linked datasets. Dr. Tedeschi will recruit subjects with pseudogout and other types of mono- and oligoarthritis to test and compare the performance of dual-energy CT scanning, musculoskeletal ultrasound, and x-ray for identifying pseudogout. Her proposed K23 projects will lead to manuscripts and data to be leveraged in an R01 application focused on pseudogout during the award period, leading to independence as a patient-oriented investigator. Project Narrative The proposed studies will contribute fundamental knowledge about pseudogout, a common, painful crystalline arthritis for which we have little prognostic information and no targeted treatments. Results from the proposed projects could lead to methods for non-invasive, accurate pseudogout diagnosis, development of preventive strategies for pseudogout, and interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Future work stemming from the proposed projects may include predictive models of pseudogout flares, identification of serum biomarkers for pseudogout, and development of outcomes measures to be used in prospectively recruited pseudogout cohort studies.",Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches,9882206,K23AR075070,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arthritis', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Calcium Pyrophosphate', 'Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diuretics', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Female', 'Flare', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Gout', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Productivity', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors', 'Pseudogout', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Synovial Fluid', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vascular calcification', 'Vascularization', 'Visit', 'Wages', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bisphosphonate', 'calcium indicator', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'crystallinity', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'imaging modality', 'instructor', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'musculoskeletal ultrasound', 'novel', 'patient health information', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ranpirnase', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'sex', 'side effect', 'stem', 'structured data', 'targeted treatment', 'unnecessary treatment']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2020,176541,327644200,0.005136093743529063
"High-definition, wide field of view corneal imaging The cornea is the primary focusing structure of our visual system. Infections and diseases in the tissue can impair vision and lead to blindness, even in eyes with intact neurosensory function. Corneal disease is one of the leading causes of visual deficiency and blindness in the world. Tissue evaluation is an important step for assessing the health of the donor cornea and its appropriateness for different types of placement, yet this process suffers from high subjectivity. High-definition corneal imaging is needed to assist in selection of the most appropriate tissue for transplant. Progress on this front would greatly serve public need, as the cornea is the most commonly transplanted tissue worldwide, with nearly 185,000 transplants annually. Thus, a more sensitive and quantitative method for objective evaluation of tissue at eye banks is needed. We have developed a 3D high-definition imaging instrument based on Gabor-Domain Optical Coherence Microscopy (GDOCM). Our SBIR Phase I research successfully accomplished all Aims and demonstrated the feasibility of quantitative assessment of corneal tissue over a large field of view with GDOCM. Our Phase I results demonstrated that GDOCM has the following key advantages over existing corneal imaging techniques, which include specular and confocal microscopy: 1) improved accuracy of tissue qualification with 4-10x increase in field of view that reduces sampling error – this will provides a truer assessment of the overall tissue characteristics; 2) ability to simultaneously measure corneal thickness, quantify endothelial cell density, and identify morphological variations due to corneal disease – this will lead to complete corneal evaluation in a single instrument; 3) leveraging machine learning innovations to minimize variability induced by users – this will result in a more objective evaluation; 4) enhanced 3D cellular-level imaging of thin translucent endothelial cells – this will enable a detailed understanding of cell viability. The results of the proposed Phase studies II will demonstrate that GDOCM can provide high-definition, 3D visualization of corneal structures with immediate commercial application for qualification of donor tissue in eye banks, and with a path to in vivo clinical imaging of patients with corneal disease. Current corneal evaluation methods employed at eye banks have limited field of view and/or insufficient resolution, and their results suffer from high subjectivity. We propose to commercialize a Gabor-domain optical coherence microscope to enable non-invasive, high-definition, wide field of view imaging in 3D for eye banks.","High-definition, wide field of view corneal imaging",10239347,R44EY028827,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Blindness', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Density', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell Viability Process', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye Banks', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Innovation Corps', 'International', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optics', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Patient imaging', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rights', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Errors', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissue Donors', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visual system structure', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinical imaging', 'commercial application', 'density', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo regeneration', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurosensory', 'novel', 'phase 2 study', 'programs', 'prototype', 'screening', 'three-dimensional visualization', 'tool', 'trend']",NEI,LIGHTOPTECH CORPORATION,R44,2020,178785,974517,-0.021610167617742242
"Leveraging modern analytic approaches to improve diabetes outcomes ABSTRACT Diabetic patients are at risk of developing diabetic heart disease, which may lead to complications in care. Diabetic heart disease patients not only have exceptionally high healthcare expenditures and resource utilization but also are likely to have poor patient outcomes. Studies have shown that early intervention of patients likely to develop diabetic heart disease is cost-effective and yields favorable health outcomes. Therefore, early identiﬁcation of diabetic patients at high-risk of developing diabetic heart disease is crucial to provide effective interventions. The commonly accepted methodology for diabetic heart disease risk prediction is the use of one or more risk scoring systems. However, these risk functions may not generalize well for the diabetes patient and may suffer from poor calibration when used on different cohorts. Moreover, the scoring systems have only been studied on coronary heart disease, one variant of diabetic heart disease while heart failure and diabetic cardiomyopathy remain important, yet insufﬁciently studied problems. Machine learning offers the ability to perform accurate predictive analytics and has been proposed as a way to identify and manage high-risk patients. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a high-impact and practical risk prediction model that can be used to per- form early identiﬁcation of high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. Given the heterogeneity and complexity of patient information in electronic health records, the model needs to capitalize on the multi-dimensional temporal nature of pa- tient records to extract identifying characteristics of patients that will develop diabetic heart disease. To accomplish this, we will leverage modern machine learning approaches such as tensor factorization and natural language processing to model complex patient characteristics, provide a more complete representation of the patient, and uncover excellent predictors of diabetic heart disease risk. An existing dataset that contains the de-identiﬁed electronic health records of approximately 4,100 diabetic patients from the Emory Healthcare System to compare the predictive power of machine learning-based algorithms with the standard risk scoring systems. These algorithms will be evaluated on calibration, discrimination, and ease of interpretability. The results of this work will provide insight as to how to develop a machine learning–based prediction system that can identify high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. The study may also shed light on the best approaches for fusing data from multiple heterogeneous sources to build a better predictive model and potentially identify novel indicators of high- risk diabetic heart disease factors. Moreover, the work will help inform a larger multi-site study of diabetic heart disease risk prediction and develop methods to generalize the results to a broader spectrum of comorbidities. This project is consistent with the National Library of Medicine's mission to translate biomedical research into practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetic patients are risk of developing diabetic heart disease which can lead to high healthcare expenditure, high resource utilization, and poor patient outcomes. Existing diabetic risk prediction models can suffer from poor calibration and predictive accuracy.

"Developing a virtual placenta biobank Project Summary / Abstract The placenta is the first organ to develop and functions as the fetal lung, kidney, gut, skin, immune and endocrine systems. It is the cause of, and reflects changes from, most diseases in pregnancy, yet remains understudied. This career development proposal will train me in the tools and practice of digital pathology, while I apply them to the placenta with the hypothesis that there are reproducible, quantitative changes in the placenta that can be modeled and used to identify abnormalities via artificial intelligence (AI). I will create a publicly available atlas of microscopically normal placentas from throughout the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. Whole slide imaging will be performed on microscopic slides of placentas from the beginning of the 2nd trimester (13 weeks) through post-term (42 weeks). I will lead a team to annotate tissue type, structures, and cells. Algorithms will be trained to replicate the manual annotations. To study the changes in the placenta over time, automated measurements will be performed to identify changes in shape, size, and cellularity of placental structures that correlate with gestational age. This research can be used to develop a model of placental development and study prematurity. I will demonstrate detection of diseases of pregnancy, using preeclampsia (PreE) as an example. Placentas with microscopic changes classically seen in PreE will be scanned and annotated and algorithms trained and tested to identify them. Like many diseases of pregnancy, placental changes in PreE are variable and sometimes absent. Slides from PreE cases with no microscopic abnormalities will be scanned and examined using the quantitative parameters developed for normal placentas, testing the hypothesis that one or more of them will significantly differ between PreE cases and gestational age- matched controls. I am an Assistant Professor of Pathology at Northwestern University with an emerging focus in informatics and machine learning for diseases of pregnancy. The mentor for this project is Lee D.A. Cooper, PhD, an expert in digital pathology and machine learning. The co-mentor is David M. Aronoff, MD, an expert in maternal-child health. Mentor and co-mentor both have a history of NIH funding and graduating mentees to independence. The advisory committee consists of a digital pathology expert (Gutman), a pediatrician (Mestan) and a pathologist physician scientist (Yang). They have proposed an aggressive schedule of one-on-one meetings, coursework, seminars, and scientific meetings to supplement learning by doing the science. Completion of these studies will build my expertise in the application of machine learning to placental pathology while creating a new, publicly- accessible tool for the rapid assessment and understanding of organ structure and function with great potential to improve maternal-child health. Project Narrative The placenta grows over the course of gestation from a single layer of cells to a complex organ that acts as the fetal skin, lung, gut, kidney, immune system, and endocrine system. This project will develop an online repository of placenta microscopic images over the course of gestation from normal placentas and one disease of pregnancy, preeclampsia. Using artificial intelligence to quantitatively describe the changes over time in normal placentas and those with disease could help understand preterm birth and diseases of pregnancy.",Developing a virtual placenta biobank,10040733,K08EB030120,"['Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Cellularity', 'Child', 'Chorion', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decidual Cell', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elements', 'Endocrine system', 'Endothelium', 'Event', 'Feeds', 'Fetal Lung', 'Fibrinoid necrosis', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Hematoma', 'Hemosiderosis', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infarction', 'Informatics', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Measurement', 'Membrane', 'Mentors', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Organ', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Placenta', 'Placentation', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Radar', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Shapes', 'Skin', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Spiral Artery of the Endometrium', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Umbilical cord structure', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Villous', 'Villus', 'Yang', 'algorithm training', 'biobank', 'career development', 'cell type', 'chorionic plate', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'fetal', 'health of the mother', 'improved', 'interest', 'intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'meetings', 'microscopic imaging', 'novel', 'online repository', 'pediatrician', 'premature', 'professor', 'supplemental instruction', 'tool', 'trophoblast', 'virtual', 'whole slide imaging']",NIBIB,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K08,2020,185630,367414121,-0.005722817721755637
"Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury Project Summary Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is recognized as the leading cause of death and disability in all parts of the world and costs the international economy approximately US$400 billion annually, which, given an estimated standardized gross world product of US $73.7 trillion, is a striking 0.5% of the entire annual global output. To address the profound issues related to a drastic increase in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for TBI over the past decades, the United States Congress highlighted injury surveillance as a federal priority. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines surveillance as “use of health-related data that precede diagnosis and signal a sufficient probability of a case or an outbreak to warrant further public health response”. To prevent TBI, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns, in addition to having strong knowledge of clinical disorders, characteristic, or other definable entity, that differentiates TBI from other clinical populations. A critical barrier to the progress of the NIH-funded program “Comorbidity in traumatic brain injury and risk of all-cause mortality, functional and financial burden: a decade-long population based cohort study” was the presence of complex and multifaceted comorbidities in a patient with TBI before and at the time of the injury, and their links to patients’ frailty, injury circumstances, severity, and outcomes. This resulted in a shift in the research paradigm, and development of a novel data mining approach used in genomics to sequence more than 70,000 clinical diagnosis codes in a TBI population, and compare them to a matched population. The developed data mining approach allowed not only the validation of previously known risk factors of TBI, but also the identification of associations previously unknown, without any preconceived human biases. This project will continue advancement of a non-hypothesis driven scientific approach, which will: (1) Characterize patients with TBI at three different time periods in relation to the TBI event – before, at the time of, and after the injury; (2) Develop individual and population level models to study the transitions between the different time states; and (3) Construct and validate predictive models of susceptibility to TBI events, adverse outcomes, and high healthcare resource use at the individual and population level. Decades- long population-based health administrative data from the publicly-funded healthcare system in Ontario, Canada is ready to be further analysed for clinical and technological advancement, to support human thinking in categorizing personal, clinical, and environmental exposure data preceding TBI. Project Narrative To detect, manage, and prevent traumatic brain injury (TBI), a complex and often lifelong disabling injury, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns and have a comprehensive knowledge of the clinical disorder, characteristic, or other definable entity that differentiates between and within persons at risk of TBI of varying mechanisms, injury presentation, and its course. This research proposal expands an ongoing NIH-funded project that started to categorize clinical comorbidities and personal and environmental exposure data into clinically meaningful factors that increase the risk of injury and its severity at the population and individual levels. With the support of data mining and big data, this proposed program will advance research methods with a goal-directed learning process and the fields of injury surveillance and precision medicine, covering a variety of interests in public health, brain injury medicine, and behavioural and social sciences.",Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury,10030705,R01NS117921,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Ambulances', 'Americas', 'Amnesia', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Pathology', 'Canada', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Elements', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Hardship', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Injury', 'International', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Natural regeneration', 'Ontario', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Province', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Secondary to', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TBI Patients', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Unconscious State', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'assault', 'behavioral/social science', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disability', 'expectation', 'falls', 'frailty', 'functional outcomes', 'gender disparity', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'injury recovery', 'injury surveillance', 'interest', 'medically necessary care', 'men', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'survivorship', 'vehicular accident', 'virtual']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,R01,2020,185878,2238991,-0.017685781281371833
"Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis Abstract This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Danhong Wang, a physician-scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Wang is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient- oriented neuroimaging research on psychiatric disorders. This K01 award will provide Dr. Wang with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in patient-oriented research in psychiatric neuroimaging; (2) to conduct experimental investigations of neurobiological correlates in patients with psychosis; (3) to implement revolutionary individual-level functional mapping techniques in clinical studies; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wang has assembled a mentoring team comprised of three mentors: Dr. Dost Öngür, Chief of the McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division, who leads a neuroimaging laboratory studying the biology of psychotic illness; Dr. Randy Buckner, Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Harvard University and Director of Psychiatric Neuroimaging at Massachusetts General Hospital, one of the pioneers in functional MRI research; and Dr. Suzanne Haber, Professor of Pharmacology and Physiology at the University of Rochester, a leading scientist in the field of neuroanatomy. In addition, Dr. Hesheng Liu, Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and a computational neuroscientist with expertise in functional imaging, will collaborate on this project. Dr. Wang will engage in multiple career development activities to expand her ability to develop mechanistic insights about psychiatric disorders. These include new training in patient-oriented experimental research, a better understanding of the psychopathology of psychosis, and a stronger grasp of neuroanatomy. She will also receive advanced training in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Determining the disconnected neural circuits underlying psychosis has proved elusive. Dr. Wang's research project aims to reveal circuitry abnormalities in psychotic patients using a subject-specific, cross-diagnostic approach. In Aim 1, Dr. Wang will establish methods for accurately characterizing the cortical and subcortical functional connectivity networks in individual patients. In Aim 2, leveraging a cross-diagnostic cohort of psychotic patients that will be scanned using the protocol optimized for individual-level functional analyses, as well as an existing patient data set, Dr. Wang will identify and validate cortical and subcortical functional connectivity abnormalities related to the severity of psychotic symptoms. In Aim 3, Dr. Wang will investigate the temporal variations of connectivity in individual patients and reveal abnormalities in dynamic functional connectivity related to symptoms. A series of preliminary studies conducted by Dr. Wang have laid the solid foundation for each specific aim. This research will form the basis of a study for identifying the “connectivity hubs” in individual patients for potential modulation, to be proposed in an R01 grant application before the end of the K award. Narrative (no more than 250 characters): The goal of the proposed project is to develop reliable functional estimates at the single- subject level to reveal abnormalities in both static and dynamic functional connectivity relevant to psychosis. !",Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis,9974565,K01MH111802,"['Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Portraits', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychology', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Solid', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cortex mapping', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'grasp', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'medical schools', 'mid-career faculty', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'professor', 'psychotic symptoms', 'support vector machine', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2020,186155,551214295,-0.006835912283312468
"Machine learning-based segmentation and risk modeling for real-time prediction of major arterial bleeding after pelvic fractures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Arterial hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is a leading reversible cause of death after blunt trauma. Prediction of arterial bleeding risk is difficult, and currently determined using subjective criteria, often based on qualitative results of admission computed tomography (CT). Segmented hematoma and contrast extravasation (CE) volumes predict need for angioembolization, major transfusion, and mortality but cannot be applied in real-time. The ill-defined multi-focal nature of pelvic hematomas and CE prevents reliable estimation using diameter-based measurements. Dr. Dreizin is a trauma radiologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. His early work has focused on improving the speed and reliability of volumetric analysis of pelvic hematomas using semi-automated techniques, and derivation of a logistic regression-based prediction tool for major arterial injury after pelvic fractures. Dr. Dreizin’s goal for this four- year K08 mentored career development award proposal is to gain the skills needed to 1) implement deep learning architectures for automated hematoma volume segmentation and 2) develop computational models for outcome prediction after pelvic trauma. These tools could greatly improve the speed and accuracy of clinical decision making in the setting of life-threatening traumatic pelvic bleeding. Fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) have emerged as the most robust and scalable method for automated medical image segmentation. Intuitive software platforms for training FCN implementations and generating multivariable machine learning models have been developed in the Python programming environment. The training objectives and research activities of this proposal are necessary to provide Dr. Dreizin with new skills and practical experience in Python programming, deep learning software, and computational modeling software. By understanding the principles and computational infrastructure behind modern machine learning, Dr. Dreizin will be able to train and validate state-of-the-art algorithms independently and effectively lead a team of researchers in this area. To achieve his goals, Dr. Dreizin has assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentors, advisors, and collaborators with world-leading expertise in computer vision in medical imaging, probability theory, data science, and comparative effectiveness research. Dr. Dreizin will focus on two specific aims. In Aim 1, he will train and validate deep learning architectures for segmentation of traumatic pelvic hematomas and CE by computing the Dice metric, time effort, and correlation with clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, he will generate and test quantitative models for predicting major arterial bleeding after pelvic trauma based on a rich multi-label dataset of segmented features. The training and pilot data will be necessary for Dr. Dreizin’s long- term goal of research independence and R01 support to develop automated segmentation algorithms for the spectrum of clinically important imaging features after pelvic trauma, as well as fully automated multivariable clinical prediction tools with potential for translation to industry and as an FDA-cleared product. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is common after motor vehicle collisions, falls, and crush injuries, with mortality rates that range from 5-54%. The volume of hemorrhage, as measured on computed tomography (CT) scans, predicts the need for rapid intervention or transfusion, and is a strong predictor of mortality, but no automated image-processing methods exist for real-time hemorrhage volume measurement. We propose to develop automated software for hemorrhage-detection, and real-time risk prediction software for major arterial hemorrhage after pelvic fractures.",Machine learning-based segmentation and risk modeling for real-time prediction of major arterial bleeding after pelvic fractures,9955253,K08EB027141,"['Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arterial Injury', 'Award', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Caliber', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Crush Injury', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Extravasation', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hematoma', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maryland', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Predictive Value', 'Probability Theory', 'Process', 'Programming Languages', 'Pythons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shorthand', 'Speed', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transfusion', 'Translations', 'Trauma', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Vehicle crash', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'artificial neural network', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'computer infrastructure', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'fall injury', 'hemodynamics', 'heuristics', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'muscle form', 'neural network architecture', 'outcome prediction', 'pelvis fracture', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'radiologist', 'random forest', 'real time model', 'secondary outcome', 'segmentation algorithm', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'support vector machine', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,K08,2020,186183,230060143,0.012879706042043772
"Deep-learning-based prediction of AMD and its progression with GWAS and fundus image data Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Successful genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of AMD have identified many disease-susceptibility genes. Through great efforts from international GWAS consortium and large-scale collaborative projects, massive datasets including high-quality GWAS data and well-characterized clinical phenotypes are now available in public repositories such as dbGaP and UK Biobank. Clinically, color fundus images have been extensively used by ophthalmologists to diagnose AMD and its severity level. The combination of wealthy GWAS data and fundus image data provides an unprecedented opportunity for researchers to test new hypotheses that are beyond the objectives of original projects. Among them, predictive models for AMD development and its progression based on both GWAS and fundus image data have not been explored. Most existing prediction models only focus on classic statistical approaches, often regression models with a limited number of predictors (e.g., SNPs). Moreover, most predictions only give static risks rather than dynamic risk trajectories over time, of which the latter is more informative for a progressive disease like AMD. Recent advances of machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, have been proven to significantly improve prediction accuracy by incorporating multiple layers of hidden non-linear effects when large-scale training datasets with well-defined phenotypes are available. Despite its success in many areas, deep learning has not been fully explored in AMD and other eye diseases. Motivated by multiple large-scale studies of AMD development or progression, where GWAS and/or longitudinal fundus image data have been collected, we propose novel deep learning methods for predicting AMD status and its progression, and to identify subgroups with significant different risk profiles. Specially, in Aim 1, we will construct a novel local convolutional neural network to predict disease occurrence (AMD or not) and severity (e.g., mild AMD, intermediate AMD, late AMD) based on (1a): a large cohort of 35,000+ individuals with GWAS data and (1b): a smaller cohort of 4,000+ individuals with both GWAS and fundus image data. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel deep neural network survival model for predicting individual disease progression trajectory (e.g., time to late-AMD). In both aims, we will use the local linear approximation technique to identify important predictors that contribute to individual risk profile prediction and to identify subgroups with different risk profiles. In Aim 3, we will validate and calibrate our methods using independent cohorts and implement proposed methods into user-friendly software and easy-to-access web interface. With the very recent FDA approval for Beovu, a novel injection treatment for wet AMD (one type of late AMD) by inhibiting VEGF and thus suppressing the growth of abnormal blood vessels, it makes our study more significant, as it will provide most cutting-edge and comprehensive prediction models for AMD which have great potential to facilitate early diagnosis and tailored treatment and clinical management of the disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this proposal is to develop new analytic methods and software tools to facilitate novel prediction of AMD development and its progression. The successful completion of the project will generate the first comprehensive set of deep-learning-based prediction models and web-based interfaces, which jointly analyzes large-scale GWAS and fundus image data and has the great potential to enhance the early diagnosis and current clinical management of AMD.

"Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD Project Summary Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. To date, researchers have attempted to use standard machine learning methodology to identify more meaningful subtypes of COPD, but these methods often make general assumptions about the data, limiting their ability to penetrate more complex patterns in some data sets. Thus, a meaningful reclassification of COPD subtypes that could lead to more targeted therapies and interventions has been elusive. The applicant introduces a new way of looking at the COPD subtyping problem by recasting it in terms of discovering associations of individuals to disease trajectories – i.e., grouping individuals based on their similarity in response to environmental and/or disease causing variables. The machine learning methods proposed build on the most recent advances in Bayesian nonparametrics, a collection of theoretical ideas and techniques that permit very flexible data representations. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that these machine learning methods and extensions thereof – together with data sources not previously leveraged for COPD subtyping – will produce more biologically meaningful sub-groupings of patients, leading to a better understanding of the genetic and biological underpinnings of the disease and ultimately improved patient management. Aim 1 of this application involves evaluating the utility of CT-assessed lung mass – a potentially more discriminative measure of emphysema than conventionally used measures – for defining COPD subtypes using both K-means clustering and our disease trajectory algorithm. The goal of Aim 2 is to evaluate the utility of comorbidity data for defining COPD subtypes using our trajectory clustering algorithm. Novel computed tomography based measures of muscle wasting (cachexia) and pulmonary vascular pruning will be explored to determine their efficacy in subtype determination. Additionally, we will extend and test the trajectory algorithm in order to model discrete outputs (such as physician-diagnosed comorbidities), count data (e.g. exacerbations), and time-to-event data (death). In Aim 3, the applicant will extend our trajectory clustering algorithms to directly incorporate genetic and omics data for subtype discovery. Together, the research proposed in the aims of this award will take full advantage of the comprehensive data set available through the COPDGene study. Execution of the aims in this proposal will be possible through active collaboration with Dr. Ron Kikinis, M.D., a renowned leader in the field of medical image analysis, and Dr. Ed Silverman, an internationally recognized expert in the genetic epidemiology of COPD. Project Narrative Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care.

"Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is notoriously difficult to diagnose non-invasively, and current methods of assessing CMD utilize only the peak velocity of the coronary flow pattern. While new imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved the assessment coronary perfusion, there are currently no non-invasive methods that incorporate the coronary flow pattern over a complete cardiac cycle to definitively assess and predict the development of CMD.  Coronary blood flow (CBF) reflects the summation of flow in the coronary microcirculation, and our lab has begun to harness the full CBF pattern under varying flow and disease conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes) to determine whether it might harbor novel clues leading to the early detection of CMD. Our past and preliminary data indicate an early onset of CMD in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that occurs prior to the onset of macrovascular complications and that are characterized by blood flow impairments and alterations in coronary resistance microvessel (CRM) structure, function, and biomechanics. Our data also uncovered innovative correlations between CRM structure/biomechanics and our newly-defined features of the coronary flow pattern, some of which were unique to normal or diabetic mice. We have initially utilized these CBF features, in the presence and absence of other factors such as cardiac function, to develop a mathematical model in collaboration with Drs. Christopher Bartlett and William Ray that to date demonstrated that 6 simple factors can predict a normal vs. diabetic coronary flow pattern with 85% predictive accuracy. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the leading cause of heart disease and is associated with hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMD) is comprised of structural and functional deficits of the tiny coronary arteries that may be an earlier indicator of disease prior to the onset of overt CAD. The proposed multidisciplinary research aims to develop a computational artificial intelligence model that will accurately predict CMD based on a non-invasive coronary flow pattern obtained by Doppler echocardiography.",Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease,9999582,R21EB026518,"['Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic mouse', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doppler Echocardiography', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elements', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperemia', 'Hypertension', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Publications', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'coronary perfusion', 'db/db mouse', 'diabetic', 'disorder prevention', 'early onset', 'experimental study', 'heart function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'macrovascular disease', 'mathematical model', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent']",NIBIB,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R21,2020,190000,43994644,-0.007884959844605605
"Improving Critical Congenital Heart Disease Screening and Detection of ""Secondary"" Targets PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  We propose to develop an automated critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) screening algorithm using machine learning techniques to combine non-invasive measurements of perfusion and oxygenation. Oxygen saturation (SpO2)-based screening is the current standard for CCHD screening, however it fails to detect up to 50% of asymptomatic newborns with CCHD or nearly 900 newborns in the United States annually. The majority of newborns missed by SpO2 screening have defects with aortic obstruction, such as coarctation of the aorta (CoA), that do not result in deoxygenated blood entering circulation. Non-invasive measurements of perfusion such as perfusion index (PIx) and pulse oximetry waveform analysis is expected to improve the detection of newborns with defects such as CoA, which is currently the most commonly missed CCHD by SpO2 screening. Both PIx and pulse oximetry waveforms can be measured non-invasively and with the same equipment used for SpO2 screening.  Members of our team recently showed that the addition of PIx, a non-invasive measurement of pulsatile blood flow, has the potential to improve CCHD detection otherwise missed by SpO2 screening. However, variability of PIx over brief time periods (seconds) and human error in its interpretation limit its clinical capabilities. Additionally, human error in interpretation of the current SpO2 screening algorithm leads to missed diagnoses and inappropriate testing in healthy newborns. Therefore, an automated SpO2-PIx screening algorithm is needed to both simplify the screening process, and improve detection of defects that are missed with SpO2 screening. In order to achieve that, we will identify the optimal PIx waveforms to create a metric that discriminates between newborns with and without CCHD. We will perform pulse oximetry waveform analysis to identify other non-invasive components with discriminatory capacity for newborns with CCHD. Additionally, we will apply supervised machine learning techniques to automate the algorithm interpretation.  The proposed research is significant because an automated SpO2-PIx screening algorithm could save the lives of hundreds of newborns with CCHD that are not diagnosed by SpO2 screening. Additionally, this is innovative as it will be the first automatic interpretation of PIx measurement among newborns with CCHD and merging of automated PIx and SpO2, which will allow for easy implementation at later steps. Through collaboration with four pediatric cardiac centers, we will establish the infrastructure and necessary multidisciplinary relationships to conduct future multicenter studies to evaluate this novel combined SpO2-PIx algorithm on a large scale involving thousands of newborns. Improving the detection of CCHD will require a multidisciplinary approach among all the individuals involved in the care and screening of newborns with CCHD. Additionally, collaboration with engineering and computer sciences will be necessary to automate the SpO2-PIx CCHD screening algorithm. PROJECT NARRATIVE A screening approach that improves earlier detection of critical congenital heart defects with systemic obstruction is critically necessary. This application seeks to develop a screening algorithm that will combine the current screening standard, oxygen saturation, with non-invasive measurements of perfusion. This high risk, high reward approach is fundamentally different from other approaches as it will use machine learning techniques, and is expected to improve the detection of critical congenital heart defects with systemic obstruction and automate the interpretation of the screening results.","Improving Critical Congenital Heart Disease Screening and Detection of ""Secondary"" Targets",10018507,R21HD099239,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Aortic coarctation', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Critical Congenital Heart Defects', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Lesion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neonatal Screening', 'New York', 'Newborn Infant', 'Obstruction', 'Oxygen', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pulsatile Flow', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Research', 'Savings', 'Screening Result', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Upper Extremity', 'Validation', 'aortic arch', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'congenital heart disorder', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'human error', 'improved', 'indexing', 'infant death', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal period', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'screening', 'supervised learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2020,192195,254622553,-0.0375205305653772
"Computational Characterization of Environmental Enteropathy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Undernutrition afflicts 20% of children < 5 years of age in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and is a major risk factor for mortality. Linear growth failure (or stunting) in children is tightly linked to irreversible physical and cognitive deficits, with profound implications for development. A common cause of stunting in LMICs is Environmental Enteropathy (EE) which has also been linked to decreased oral vaccine immunogenicity. To date, there are no universally accepted, clear diagnostic algorithms or non-invasive biomarkers for EE making this a critical priority. In this K23 Mentored Career Development Award application, Dr. Sana Syed, a Pediatric Gastroenterologist with advanced training in Nutrition at the University of Virginia, proposes to 1) Develop and validate a Deep Learning Net to identify morphological features of EE versus celiac and healthy small intestinal tissue, 2) correlate the Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing EE intestinal tissue findings with clinical phenotype, measures of gut barrier and absorption, and bile acid deconjugation, and 3) Use a Deep Learning Net computational approach to identify distinguishing multiomic patterns of EE versus celiac disease. This work will be carried out in the context of an ongoing birth cohort study of environmental enteropathy in Pakistan (SEEM). Dr. Syed proposes a career development plan which includes mentorship, fieldwork, coursework, publications, and clinical time that will situate her as an independent physician-scientist with expertise in translational research employing computational `omics and image approaches to elucidate biologic mechanisms of stunting pathways and in identification of novel and effective therapies for EE. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development award will: a) Lead to the development and validation of a pediatric-specific Environmental Enteropathy (EE) Deep Learning Net for small intestinal structure which is urgently needed to standardize the diagnosis, care, and research of EE worldwide; b) Employ computational methods to correlate Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing morphological EE features with multiomic data to provide comprehensive diagnostic and predictive criteria for EE, and c) Validation of promising circulating biomarkers against intestinal biopsies, the diagnostic gold standard for enteropathies. Successful completion of this work will channel our improved understanding of the gut's critical role in childhood stunting pathways towards effective interventions to improve nutrition and health in at risk populations.",Computational Characterization of Environmental Enteropathy,9928452,K23DK117061,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Asia', 'Bangladeshi', 'Bile Acids', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Celiac Disease', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Duodenum', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gluten', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human Pathology', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Impairment', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lactulose', 'Lamina Propria', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Lymphocytosis', 'MS4A1 gene', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Milieu Therapy', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neurocognitive', 'Pakistan', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rhamnose', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Small Intestines', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Virginia', 'Visual', 'Work', 'absorption', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'circulating biomarkers', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'disorder control', 'effective intervention', 'effective therapy', 'enteric pathogen', 'epithelium regeneration', 'imaging approach', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'intraepithelial', 'low and middle-income countries', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'nutrient absorption', 'nutrition', 'oral vaccine', 'patient oriented', 'socioeconomics', 'tissue injury', 'transcriptome', 'urinary']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,K23,2020,192552,169622494,-0.0010857660448251609
"MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy parkinsonian type (MSA-P), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are costly and devastating neurodegenerative diseases. They have overlapping clinical manifestations and diagnosis remains challenging in many cases. Thus far no effective treatments have been developed to meaningfully slow or stop their progression. This is due in part to a lack of tools to objectively measure degeneration in the neural systems affected by each of these diseases. Availability of such tools would assist clinical diagnosis, facilitate selection of appropriate patient groups for trial recruitment, and enable objective measurement of treatment outcomes. Recent MRI studies suggest that disease-specific brain changes can, indeed, be identified in these parkinsonian diseases. The objective of this research is to identify univariable markers and multivariable MRI signatures that capture distinct patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to accurately distinguish these diseases.  To accomplish this the investigators use 3 Tesla MRI contrasts sensitive to key features of neurodegeneration to 1) identify structures damaged by PD, MSA-P and PSP and 2) to quantify the extent of damage in each neural system in parkinsonian diseases. Specifically, the investigators use neuromelanin- sensitive MRI to measure neuromelanin loss and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and R2* imaging to measure iron accumulation in patients with PD, MSA-P, and PSP. Using these contrasts and an innovative region of interest (ROI) selection approach, they reproducibly measure patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems. In Aim 1 the investigators use neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to study neuromelanin loss in PD, MSA-P and PSP in to identify univariable disease features that are differentially affected by parkinsonian diseases and may assist distinguishing these conditions. In Aim 2 they use QSM and R2* MRI to study ROIs differentially impacted by PD, MSA-P and PSP to identify iron accumulation biomarkers to help distinguish these diseases. In Aim 3 the investigators apply machine learning classification algorithms to identify multivariable MRI signatures of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to differentiate PD, MSA-P and PSP. Study outputs will be candidate MRI biomarkers and disease signatures. The long term goal of this research is to further develop these outputs for use as clinical diagnostic tools and as biomarkers for subject selection and outcome measurement in clinical trials.  Through this career award Dr. Huddleston will gain new skills in MRI methods, data science, and neural systems imaging in parkinsonian diseases. These new skills will enable Dr. Huddleston to design and lead interdisciplinary neuroimaging biomarker studies for Parkinson’s disease and related disorders. His mentor team is comprised of leaders in their fields. This team and the dynamic research environment at Emory University provide the necessary support for Dr. Huddleston to successfully transition to scientific independence. There is an urgent public health need for new treatments to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy, and objective tools to distinguish these diseases for clinical and research purposes are lacking. The outputs of the proposed research will be candidate MRI biomarkers and multivariable MRI signatures to differentiate these conditions. These candidate biomarkers may be developed for use in clinical trial designs to increase their odds of success, and they may also assist clinical diagnosis.",MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism,9999688,K23NS105944,"['Affect', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical assessments', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Iron', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple System Atrophy', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Progressive Supranuclear Palsy', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Red nucleus structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Subjects Selections', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning classifier', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromelanin', 'neuron loss', 'nigrostriatal system', 'novel', 'pars compacta', 'patient screening', 'putamen', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,192564,507546965,-0.0161939947962377
"EEG and MRI Biomarkers to Predict Post-traumatic Epilepsy Project Summary Dr. Jennifer A. Kim is a critical care neurologist and neuroscientist at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Her long-term career goal is to become an independently funded translational investigator with expertise in signal processing of neurophysiologic and neuroimaging data to identify early biomarkers of secondary brain injury in critically ill patients, particularly related to post-traumatic epilepsy. Post-traumatic epilepsy is a disabling complication of traumatic brain injury (TBI). There is an urgent need to find biomarkers of post-traumatic epilepsy to identify patients at high risk for developing this complication. It is a population in which early biomarker identification could improve patient monitoring and ultimately treatment development to circumvent epileptogenesis. Post- traumatic epilepsy contributes to worsening of the already high rates of TBI morbidity, disability and cost of care, thus emphasizing the importance of preventing this complication. We need to find biomarkers to best define those most likely to benefit from potential treatments and make such treatment discovery trials more feasible. During the proposed training period, the candidate will expand upon her knowledge of EEG signal processing and machine learning techniques and acquire new skills in neuroimaging analysis using Magnetic Resonance technologies and biostatistics. To accomplish this, Dr. Kim has brought together a strong mentorship team of Dr. Hal Blumenfeld (primary mentor) and co-mentors Drs. Todd Constable, Brandon Westover and Brian Edlow who have expertise in multi-modal approaches to studying epilepsy, functional MRI analysis, computational EEG analysis and structural TBI imaging, respectively. Under their mentorship, Dr. Kim proposes to: 1) quantify epileptiform abnormality (EA) frequency and identify EA waveform features that optimally predict PTE, 2) determine if direct hippocampal injury, assessed by cortical thickness and contusion volume, stratifies PTE risk 3) assess whether indirect hippocampal injury, based on structural and functional MRI connectivity analyses, portend PTE. The overall goal is to identify early biomarkers of patients at high risk for post-traumatic epilepsy to target development of anti-epileptogenesis treatments. Bringing together advanced neurophysiologic and neuroimaging analysis and this strong mentorship support, this project opens new avenues for optimizing follow-up care and advancing potential treatment development for all traumatic brain injury patients at risk for post-traumatic epilepsy. This well-defined patient-oriented research proposal, in concert with the mentorship and structured didactic curriculum, will provide Dr. Kim with the skills that are essential to develop an independent career in neurophysiological and neuroimaging research that translates to improving patient outcomes. Project Narrative Post-traumatic epilepsy, a seizure disorder secondary to traumatic brain injury (TBI), is among the most disabling and difficult-to-treat complications of TBI. Currently, there are no tools to identify patients a priori at highest risk for PTE. Dr. Kim's proposed career development plan has great potential to advance our knowledge of the acute biomarkers of PTE using EEG and MRI, to improve early identification and ultimately provide treatment options for this potentially preventable complication.",EEG and MRI Biomarkers to Predict Post-traumatic Epilepsy,10055272,K23NS112596,"['Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptogenic', 'Atrophic', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blinded', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Complication', 'Contusions', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Electroencephalography', 'Enrollment', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Epilepsy', 'Prevention trial', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Rodent Model', 'Sclerosis', 'Secondary to', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'TBI Patients', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker identification', 'care costs', 'career', 'career development', 'cost estimate', 'didactic education', 'disability', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'human imaging', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurophysiology', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient oriented research', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'preventable epilepsy', 'prospective', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,192780,550947887,-0.010646006090350518
"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at a younger age have higher rates of complications than those diagnosed later in life. Given the lasting benefit conferred by early disease control, the initial care provided to this growing, high-risk population is particularly crucial. With this proposed career development award, Dr. Gopalan will acquire the research skills necessary to identify patients at highest risk for inadequate early disease control, define barriers to initial disease management, and develop an intervention designed to improve the care of adults (ages 21-44) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,10001486,K23DK116968,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United Kingdom', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diabetes education', 'diabetes management', 'disorder control', 'eHealth', 'early onset', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'literacy', 'macrovascular disease', 'member', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'racial and ethnic', 'skills', 'social determinants', 'social stigma', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'young adult']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K23,2020,192914,111231681,-0.014058873536387205
"Developing Database and Software infrastructure for Quantitative Radiologic Analysis of Lumbar Radiculopathy Project Summary/Abstract Diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy (LR) currently relies on a qualitative interpretation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies and lacks standardization. This has led to inconsistent treatment and rising costs, while quality of life metrics have remained stagnant. To standardize the diagnosis of LR, the subjective and qualitative radiologic assessment needs to be augmented with accurate measurements of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas, two anatomical structures that are critical to the etiology of LR. However, precise measurements will require manual delineations of these regions on MRI. This is a tedious and time-consuming process that is not feasible on a daily, large-scale basis in the clinic. Deep Learning (DL) is a relatively new machine learning technique, which holds the promise of automating NF and CC segmentation. None the less, there remain several challenges to making DL-based segmentation routine in clinical practice. First, training and validating a DL model for segmentation of a given anatomical structure requires a large amount of expert annotated training data. Expert annotated data is expensive and time consuming to obtain, thus thwarting the development of quantitative imaging diagnostics for LR. To address this, we propose an expert-led manual delineation of NF and CC using de-identified MRI data extracted from UCLA's picture archiving and communications system (PACS). We expect the resulting database to contain data from over 35,000 lumbar MRI scans, with associated clinical history, demographics, and patient outcomes data. In a subset (1000) of these data, NFs and CCs will be annotated by multiple human expert raters. The consensus of these delineations will be used as ground truth segmentations to train, validate and improve our understanding of DL models. Secondly, as a part of this proposal, we aim to address several technical challenges that limit the deployment of automated image segmentation techniques to the clinic. Chief amongst these challenges is the failure of automated methodologies in the face of variation due to factors such as pathology, scanner protocol alterations, and general demographic variation. Additionally, our current understanding of DL does not allow us to categorically state the total number of expert annotated data that will be needed to train a model with a specified level of accuracy. Finally, we do not currently understand how selection of training cases for expert delineation affects generalization accuracy. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose experiments to define the relationship between DL algorithms and the cardinality of training data. We will also explore the use of unsupervised machine learning strategies, namely clustering and reinforcement learning, to understand how training data selection influences algorithmic accuracy. In summary, we propose to address data availability and technical knowledge gaps to the development of accurate DL-based techniques for automated NF and CC delineation, with a broader view to standardize the diagnosis and treatment of LR. Project Narrative Basing radiological diagnoses on a quantitative characterization of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas would greatly improve the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar radiculopathy (LR). Manual measurement of this anatomy on every clinical study is not feasible; however, deep learning- (DL) based automated methods can reliable perform this task if 1) expert annotations to train DL algorithms are available and 2) we can train DL models to work accurately despite image heterogeneity. We address these knowledge gaps by developing 1) a database containing spine MR images with expert annotation of NFs and CCs and 2) intelligent training data selection frameworks to train DL algorithms and assess their robustness to heterogeneity.",Developing Database and Software infrastructure for Quantitative Radiologic Analysis of Lumbar Radiculopathy,9928429,R21EB026665,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Categories', 'Central cord canal structure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Intelligence', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Investigative Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural History', 'Needs Assessment', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Radiculopathy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Diseases', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical database', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'experimental study', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'network architecture', 'neural network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'relational database', 'segmentation algorithm', 'software infrastructure', 'theories', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment optimization', 'unsupervised learning']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2020,195000,673201228,0.003412140831660434
"Mobile bedside ultrasound for the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia in resource limited settings Project Summary In low and middle-income countries (LMICs) pneumonia is by far the leading cause of death among children < 5 years of age. Despite progress in reducing global pneumonia deaths, pneumonia still kills over 1 million children a year. A key factor is the challenge of pneumonia diagnosis. Chest X-Ray is the gold standard for pneumonia diagnoses but exposes children to ionizing radiation and is mainly restricted to hospital settings. Outside of hospitals, pneumonia is diagnosed based on clinical grounds using the WHO’s Integrated Management of Childhood Illness algorithms. However, that approach lacks specificity, resulting in significant overdiagnosis of pneumonia. That wastes precious resources, exposes children to antibiotics unnecessarily, and delays identification of the true cause of a child’s illness. Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in bedside ultrasound as a radiation-sparing alternative to X- Ray. The accuracy of bedside US for diagnosing pneumonia is comparable to X-Ray. However, traditional bedside US suffers the same limitations as X-Rays in terms of portability, and still requires interpretation of images by a trained radiologist. Recent innovations in ultrasound technology and artificial intelligence applications suggest a possible pathway forward. Bluetooth enabled US transponders that connect to a smart phone or tablet, effectively create a truly portable US suite that can fit into one’s pocket. Similarly, advances in artificial intelligence render possible the automated interpretation of mobile bedside US (mBSUS) images on a smart phone, obviating the need for a radiologist. The twin goals of this project are: 1) to compare the accuracy of the mobile, Bluetooth US system, linked to a cell phone, against the gold standard of Chest X-Ray for diagnosis of pneumonia among children aged 1-59 months; and 2) to apply machine learning algorithms to assist in the identification of accurate classification features that reliably identify lobar pneumonia. If successful, this would be a pivotal first step towards the goal of a truly portable yet still highly accurate approach to the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia that could function autonomously without the need for external evaluation by a skilled radiologist. Such a tool would revolutionize pneumonia case management in resource limited parts of the world and could save the lives of many. Project Narrative Pneumonia remains the leading cause of death for children <5 years around the world. A key barrier is the lack of affordable and portable imaging systems. In this project, we will 1) test the accuracy of a mobile ultrasound system that connects to a smart phone via blue tooth against the gold standard of chest X-Ray, and 2) use machine learning algorithms to automate the diagnosis of pneumonia, thereby obviating the need for external review by a radiologist.",Mobile bedside ultrasound for the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia in resource limited settings,9983501,R21TW011343,"['5 year old', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Aorta', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blinded', 'Bluetooth', 'Breast Feeding', 'Breathing', 'Case Management', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest wall structure', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Convulsions', 'Coughing', 'Cyanosis', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Head', 'Heart', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Lethargies', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pediatric Radiologist', 'Pleura', 'Pneumococcal Pneumonia', 'Pneumonia', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Regional Anatomy', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Diaphragm', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Ultrasonography', 'Unconscious State', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vomiting', 'Zambia', 'aged', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'drinking', 'health training', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'low and middle-income countries', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'portability', 'radiologist', 'smartphone Application', 'tool', 'wasting']",FIC,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R21,2020,198038,164685352,-0.02260128479252509
"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carolyn Hendrickson, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Hendrickson is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented research of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a focus on the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This K23 award will provide Dr. Hendrickson with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert clinical and translational researcher in ARDS after traumatic injury; (2) to study the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after TBI involving platelet biology, endothelial activation, and lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation; (3) to implement advanced analyses of complex observational data, including machine learning; (4) to develop an independent translational research career. Dr. Hendrickson's plan to achieve these goals is supported by a multidisciplinary mentoring team of experts. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Matthay, has extensive experience in translational ARDS research and in the career development of early stage investigators. Dr. Hendrickson will work with four co-mentors: Dr. Mitchell Cohen, a translational researcher studying coagulation after trauma, Dr. Alan Hubbard, a biostatistician specializing in causal inference, Dr. Geoffrey Manley, a neurosurgeon and leading investigator in TBI research, and Dr. Mark Looney, an expert platelet biology and lung injury. The development of ARDS after TBI is common and is associated with worse neurological outcomes. The biologic mechanisms driving ARDS after TBI are poorly understood. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the risk of ARDS after TBI is mediated through activated vascular endothelium and platelets as well as non-protective mechanical ventilation strategies that use large tidal volumes. Dr. Hendrickson will investigate these causal pathways utilizing previously collected data and plasma from an ongoing observational cohort study. In this same cohort she will prospectively collect biospecimens, detailed mechanical ventilation data, and lung ultrasound images. This proposal represents an innovative approach to studying ARDS after TBI using carefully adjudicated exposures and outcomes. Dr. Hendrickson will test whether plasma biomarkers of endothelial activation, vascular permeability, and inflammation (Aim 1) and platelet function, activation, and aggregation (Aim 2) are associated with ARDS after TBI. She will collect lung ultrasound images and frequent mechanical ventilation data including tidal volumes and plateau pressures. She will test whether early exposure to non-protective mechanical ventilation is associated with ARDS after TBI (Aim 3). Addressing this gap in knowledge may lead to interventions that prevent ARDS and improve outcomes in this patient population. The research and training outlined in this proposal will form the basis for an R01-level proposal designed to study interventions to prevent and treat ARDS after traumatic injury. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because each year in the United States 1.7 million people sustain a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and over 20% of patients with severe isolated TBI develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a form of serious lung disease associated with poor neurological outcomes after TBI. Identification of biologic factors and mechanical ventilation parameters that contribute to ARDS pathogenesis after TBI is the first step in a continuum of research that will pave the way to prevention, personalized risk assessment, improved early management, and targeted treatments for ARDS in patients with TBI. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms of disease in this vulnerable population will expand the understanding of lung injury pathogenesis after a variety of traumatic injuries and perhaps in other high-risk populations.","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation",9983146,K23HL133495,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Angiopoietin-2', 'Animals', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Flow Cytometry', 'Blood Platelets', 'Body Weight', 'California', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Endothelium', 'Enrollment', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-8', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mediating', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Platelet Activation', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Supportive care', 'TBI Patients', 'TIMP3 gene', 'Testing', 'Thrombelastography', 'Thromboxane B2', 'Tidal Volume', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic injury', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'Vascular Permeabilities', 'Ventilator-induced lung injury', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'blood-brain barrier disruption', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung injury', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient population', 'platelet function', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'stem', 'training opportunity', 'translational scientist']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2020,198907,685608202,0.017364126567690874
"Optimizing anti-epileptic drug treatment in acute brain injury Project Summary/Abstract Dr. Zafar is a neurointensivist and clinical neurophysiologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital, whose goal is to become an independent investigator with expertise in comparative effectiveness research and pragmatic clinical trials using neurophysiologic tools, to improve outcomes in patients with acute brain injuries and seizures. Epileptiform abnormalities (seizures and seizure-like rhythmic patterns) are seen on electroencephalography (EEG) in up to 40% of acute brain injury patients and are associated with worse outcomes. Due to lack of evidence-based guidance, patients with epileptiform abnormalities are often aggressively treated with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), exposing them to AED related adverse effects that may worsen outcomes. Dr. Zafar's preliminary data shows that increasing burden of epileptiform abnormalities in patients with hemorrhagic stroke is associated with worse outcomes. Up to half these patients receive AED treatment with no improvement in outcomes, and AED use itself is independently associated with worse outcomes. Dr. Zafar has built a comprehensive EEG database of 2000 patients to investigate AED effectiveness. In her career development plan, she will be using the rich neurophysiologic data in the EEG database, along with a nationwide dataset (Premier Healthcare Database) to study AED and EEG utilization patterns and AED effectiveness in a “real-clinical world” setting. Under the mentorship of Dr. M. Bradon Westover, and co-mentors (Dr. John Hsu, Dr. Elisabetta Patorno, and Dr. Hang Lee), Dr. Zafar proposes to: 1) Determine which specific epileptiform abnormalities show an acute response to AEDs by assessing neurological improvement within 24 hours of treatment (EEG database), 2) Assess the impact of AEDs on in- hospital clinical adverse outcomes and discharge functional outcomes in acute brain injury patients with epileptiform abnormalities (EEG database), 3) Investigate how AED-related adverse outcomes vary with practice patterns across hospitals with different resources and EEG utilization patterns (Premier Database). Dr. Zafar will perform a systematic exploration of the EEG database to determine EEG phenotypes associated with response to AED treatment, and determine the impact of AEDs on in-hospital adverse outcomes (e.g. mortality, hepatotoxicity, cardiac events). To account for national variation in AED prescription, hospital resources and EEG use, Dr. Zafar will examine adverse outcomes in the Premier Database. In addition to the proposed research, Dr. Zafar's career development plan includes a Masters of Science and coursework on analysis of large databases, pharmacoepidemiology and machine learning. Dr. Zafar will receive guidance from her mentors and advisors with diverse clinical and scientific expertise. The proposed training will allow Dr. Zafar to establish a niche in using neurophysiologic data in comparative effectiveness research and launch an independent research career aimed at improving neurologic outcomes in patients with acute brain injuries. Project Narrative Although patients admitted with brain injuries such as stroke and traumatic brain injury are at high risk for developing seizures, physicians have very limited information to guide anti-epileptic drug management in such patients. This results in frequent overuse of anti-epileptic mediations that are also known to have harmful side effects. Dr. Zafar's proposed project will significantly advance our knowledge on which patients benefit the most from treatment and which patients are at highest risk for harmful side effects, providing guidance for physicians in making treatment decisions that will improve outcomes in the thousands of brain injury patients admitted to US hospitals each year.",Optimizing anti-epileptic drug treatment in acute brain injury,10019612,K23NS114201,"['Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'General Hospitals', 'Glasgow Coma Scale', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Master of Science', 'Mediation', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological Models', 'Neurological outcome', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Seizures', 'Severity of illness', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Variant', 'active comparator', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'disorder subtype', 'evidence base', 'functional outcomes', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'mortality', 'neurophysiology', 'patient subsets', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'side effect', 'skills', 'stroke patient', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2020,200880,551214295,-0.03458950667723043
"Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This career development award will provide early career support for investigation of the management of infec- tious diseases in the setting of addiction in hospitals. The award will provide support for the candidate to develop expertise in the following areas: 1) addiction science research; 2) natural language processing; 3) machine learn- ing; 4) professional development; and 5) responsible conduct of research. For this, Dr. Goodman-Meza will be mentored by a multidisciplinary, cross-institutional team with expertise in addiction, infectious diseases, and data science. His primary mentor, Dr. Steve Shoptaw, has an extensive track record in addiction-related research and training of future independent investigators. His co-mentors include Dr. Alex Bui and Dr. Matthew B. Goetz. Dr. Bui is an expert in biomedical data science and heads NIH training programs in this field. Dr. Goetz has broad experience of productive infectious diseases clinical research within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The current opioid epidemic in the United States has been associated with an increase in infections, in particular hepatitis C and bacterial infections. Bacterial infections are the leading infectious diagnosis leading to hospitali- zation in individuals with an opioid use disorder (OUD), and incur significant healthcare expenditures. Despite the availability of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) in the form of methadone or buprenorphine, less than 20% of people with OUD actually receive OAT. Hospitalization for a bacterial infection may be an ideal time to initiate OAT, but the benefits of this practice are unknown. In this proposal, the candidate will assess the impact of initiating OAT in people who inject opioids admitted to the VHA due to a Staphylococcus aureus blood stream infection (bacteremia) – the most common bacterial pathogen among people who inject opioids. Using data already collected for 36,868 cases of S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) from the VHA electronic data repository, the candidate will address three research questions: 1) is a natural language processing algorithm (NLP) more ac- curate than a standard International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code-based approach at screening records to correctly identify individuals who inject opioids in a cohort of patients admitted with SAB; 2) what are the temporal and geographic trends of SAB in people who inject opioids and those who receive OAT at the facility- level; and 3) using a machine learning framework, what are the estimated impacts of OAT on patient centered outcomes – death, readmissions, leaving against medical advice, and subsequent outpatient engagement in OAT. These formative data will help the candidate to establish a productive early career as a physician-scientist and advise development of an OAT-delivery strategy to mitigate infectious complications of injection opioid use. Through this award, Dr. Goodman-Meza will establish himself as an expert physician-scientist at the intersection of infectious disease and addiction, poised to make significant contributions to this important area of medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Serious, life-threatening bacterial infections in people who inject drugs are increasing with the current national opioid epidemic. Hospitalization of people who use opioids for treatment of infectious complications may be an ideal time to initiate opioid agonist therapy (OAT), an evidence-based practice that has been historically underuti- lized. This project will use innovative data science methods to estimate the impact of initiating OAT in the hospital for patients with a history of opioid injection admitted for treatment of blood stream infections caused by Staph- ylococcus aureus in the Veterans Health Administration.",Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections,9951022,K08DA048163,"['Acute suppurative arthritis due to bacteria', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Behavior', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Research', 'Coagulation Process', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Outcome', 'Distant', 'Drug usage', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Embolism', 'Endocarditis', 'Epidemic', 'Equipment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'HIV risk', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C Transmission', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immunosuppression', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injecting drug user', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Life', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Predisposition', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Services', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Travel', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans', 'Water', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'blood treatment', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'cohort', 'data format', 'data warehouse', 'efficacy testing', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health administration', 'heroin use', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'injection drug use', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid injection', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'opioid user', 'overdose death', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic virus', 'prescription opioid', 'responsible research conduct', 'screening', 'skin microbiota', 'time interval', 'treatment services', 'trend', 'viral transmission']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K08,2020,203040,673201228,-0.002406442997536811
"Anatomic biomarkers of chronic kidney disease progression among children Progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in childhood is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic bone disease, and death. Congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), including posterior urethral valves, account for 50-60% of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children and are the most common cause of ESRD in this age group. In children with CAKUT, kidney injury is often already established at birth due to renal dysplasia. Some children, however, maintain preserved kidney function into adulthood while others progress to ESRD in childhood. Our ability to effectively implement therapies to slow CKD progression is limited by our lack of understanding of which patients are at greatest risk for CKD progression and therefore would be most likely to benefit from early intervention. Thus there is a need for biomarkers that can identify children with CAKUT early in life who are at high risk of future CKD progression. To identify children with CAKUT early in life who are at high risk of future CKD progression, we will develop novel computational methods to derive clinically informative biomarkers from ultrasound (US) imaging data using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and effectively integrate them with established clinical measures for early prediction of CKD progression. To achieve reliable and accurate kidney segmentation, Aim 1 develops an automatic kidney segmentation method by adopting fully CNNs, conditional random fields, and active contour models to simultaneously learn informative high-level image features and inter-voxel relationship under shape regularizations to improve the segmentation accuracy and robustness to imaging noise. To achieve improved prediction of CDK progression based on US imaging data, deep CNNs will be adopted to learn informative imaging features in a multi-instance learning framework to predict which children with CAKUT will develop CKD progression and their timing of progression in Aim 2. These techniques will be applied to a dataset of patients followed at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, in order to derive individualized predictive indices of CKD progression. The proposed new techniques will allow us to early differentiate patients with distinct disease progression patterns.

"Enabling Kinematic Joint Profiling Using MRI Project Summary We propose a technical feasibility study seeking to develop methods for quantitative kinematic proﬁling of moving joints using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the context of this study, a kinematic proﬁle is deﬁned as a collection of joint characteristics computed and tracked during the course of movement. This project is motivated by the hypothesis that such proﬁling of moving joints can highlight dysfunction, treatment progress, and point towards favorable (or unfavorable) surgical interventions. At a high level, it is envisioned that the proposed kinematic proﬁles could ﬁt into clinical management workﬂows much in the same way as blood biomarker panels.  While kinematic imaging of joints can be performed using plain-ﬁlm (PF) X-ray, computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound (US) methods, MRI is the gold-standard for advanced orthopedic assessment and is an appealing option for accessory kinematic analysis. A set of relatively fast kinematic proﬁling acquisitions could feasibly be added to routine orthopedic MRI exams, thereby providing optimal diagnostic imaging in both static and kinematic contexts within a single visit.  Though several preliminary studies have hinted at the potential diagnostic value of kinematic imaging data, such data is difﬁcult to interpret and cannot easily be quantiﬁed or captured in clinical records. In this study, we seek to establish fundamental methods that can provide simple and easily digestible kinematic imaging reports with data acquired in a short scan interval using conventional clinical MRI equipment.  As a preliminary feasibility investigation of these methods, kinematic imaging of the wrist will be studied. Dysfunction of the scaphoid and lunate bones in the wrist is a well-studied kinematic problem of diagnostic signiﬁcance. Novel 4D zero-echo-time MRI of the wrist will be used to capture the kinematic imaging using for proﬁling of the scaphoid-lunate mechanics during two established wrist movement patterns.  The goal of this project is to establish and demonstrate methodological components required for MRI kinematic proﬁling. Data collection on a modest-sized cohort of 100 healthy control subjects is proposed for this purpose. Novel MRI pulse-sequence and post-processing development components are introduced and tasked for analysis of this normative data. Using the acquired MRI data, kinematic parameters for each dynamic dataset will be extracted and curated into a multi-parametric proﬁle for each subject.  Aim 2 of the study proposes the use of external sensor motion capture methods to validate the MRI-based kinematic parameter measurements on 50% of the study cohort.  Finally, Aim 3 of the study seeks to use machine-learning clustering approaches to develop a kinematic proﬁle normalization procedure using the acquired control dataset. Such normalization is a crucial milestone in the translation of kinematic proﬁling to the clinic and will establish a baseline for future translational studies of symptomatic cohorts. Project Narrative We seek to develop and demonstrate fundamental methods in quantitative kinematic proﬁling using clinical diagnostic imaging equipment. This technical development project is constructed under the hypothesis that such proﬁling of moving joints can highlight dysfunction, treatment progress, and point towards favorable (or unfavorable) surgical interventions. Using currently available advanced magnetic resonance imaging technology, data collected from a controlled subject cohort will be used to develop and test the proposed kinematic proﬁling technology on the moving wrist.",Enabling Kinematic Joint Profiling Using MRI,9893679,R21AR075327,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Process', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cartilage', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Film', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Ligaments', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Population Control', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scanning', 'Scaphoid bone', 'Semilunar Bone', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Upper Extremity', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Wrist joint', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'blood perfusion', 'bone', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'heart function', 'high resolution imaging', 'human subject', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'joint mobilization', 'kinematics', 'motion sensor', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'soft tissue', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'translational study', 'volunteer', 'water diffusion']",NIAMS,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R21,2020,214720,122662885,-0.003913119923543401
"Accurate quantification of kidney function with non-sedated motion-compensated pediatric MRI Project Summary: Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is an impairment of urine flow from the renal pelvis into the proximal ureter and is the most common cause of hydronephrosis in neonates. This disorder is detected in up to 7% of all maternal ultrasound scans, and an estimated 10% of these newborns have hydronephrosis, which, if left untreated, may result in early failure of functional renal development in these patients. Current methods of assessing kidney function in neonates and children are less than optimal, however. While the current reference standard, nuclear renography (MAG3), yields some useful diagnostic information; it is invasive, slow, provides low resolution, does not offer anatomic detail, and delivers potentially harmful ionizing radiation. Thus, there is an urgent, unmet need to develop a method for functional imaging of kidneys that is non-invasive, safe, accurate, reproducible and radiation-free. The primary objective of this exploratory, two-year study, therefore, is two-fold: first, to develop advanced methods of motion-compensated, high spatial and temporal resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the improved quantification of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), an important marker of renal function; and second, to demonstrate the superiority of this method over the current reference standard, nuclear renography (MAG3). Our application in response to PAR-18-743 is specifically aimed at developing, and evaluating motion-robust, high spatiotemporal resolution dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) for quantifying GFR (MR-GFR) as well as creating new automated analysis software to enable the robust and reproducible assessment of differential renal function in newborns eliminating need for sedation, and in older children. Our method will overcome the technical challenges of current DCE-MRI techniques providing high temporal resolution to capture fast arterial input function dynamics required for accurate computation of GFR, compensate for unavoidable respiratory and bulk motion to reconstruct high quality images and will provide robust, fast, automated post processing techniques for accurate GFR computation. As a non-invasive, motion-robust, radiation-free imaging technique that can depict renal structures at much higher resolution, MR-GFR will offer, for the first time, a level of diagnostic information that is unattainable with MAG3. The critical importance of understanding the extent and severity of UPJO (and resulting hydronephrosis) cannot be understated; for in the absence of this information, children who stand to benefit from immediate surgery might be overlooked or delayed in receiving treatment; and those who might benefit from a more conservative approach (i.e., watching waiting) might receive an unnecessary surgical intervention. Indeed, this novel imaging approach is expected to substantially improve clinical decision-making. The successful completion of our aims will enable 1) assessment of renal function accurately; 2) predicting the likelihood of functional decline; and 3) determining whether surgery is indicated. DCE-MRI is expected to have rapid translational impact for several diseases effecting kidney function once it is introduced into clinical practice. Project Narrative: This project addresses the need to develop advanced methods of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess kidney function in newborns and in older children who have been diagnosed with ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO), an impairment of urine flow that is the most common cause of hydronephrosis (inability to void urine). Unfortunately, severe hydronephrosis, left untreated, can result in permanent damage to the child's kidneys and our novel method of assessing kidney function, dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), promises to evaluate the extent of this disorder in a way that is highly accurate, non- invasive, safe, reliable, and radiation-free and will eliminate the need of repeated scans, sedation and anesthesia when imaging newborns with congenital hydronephrosis. Most importantly, this approach will enable the clinician to confidently and quickly refer children for corrective surgery based on imaging results; and likewise, recommend other children for more conservative “watchful-waiting”, effectively reducing the number of unnecessary surgeries.",Accurate quantification of kidney function with non-sedated motion-compensated pediatric MRI,9877232,R21DK123569,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age-Months', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drainage procedure', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Free Will', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gadolinium', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Hospitalization', 'Hydronephrosis', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Infection', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Function Tests', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Liquid substance', 'Lower urinary tract', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Nephrectomy', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nuclear', 'Obstruction', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pain', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Pentetic Acid', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Reference Standards', 'Renal function', 'Renal pelvis', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sedation procedure', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Ultrasonography', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Ureter', 'Ureteropelvic junction obstruction', 'Urine', 'Urology', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated algorithm', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bulk motion', 'care costs', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep neural network', 'functional decline', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kidney imaging', 'kinetic model', 'neonate', 'neural network algorithm', 'novel', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'renal artery', 'respiratory', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement', 'translational impact', 'urologic']",NIDDK,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2020,221250,209484975,0.00023183718098571953
"Integrative Predictors of Temporomandibular Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This application proposes the development of efficient web-based data management, mining, and analytics, to integrate and analyze clinical, biological, and high dimensional imaging data from TMJ OA patients. Based on our published results, we hypothesize that patterns of condylar bone structure, clinical symptoms, and biological mediators are unrecognized indicators of the severity of progression of TMJ OA. Efficiently capturing, curating, managing, integrating and analyzing this data in a manner that maximizes its value and accessibility is critical for the scientific advances and benefits that such comprehensive TMJ OA patient information may enable. High dimensional databases are increasingly difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional processing applications, creating a continuing demand for innovative approaches. Toward this end, the DCBIA at the Univ. of Michigan has partnered with the University of North Carolina, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Kitware Inc. Through high-dimensional quantitative characterization of individuals with TMJ OA, at molecular, clinical and imaging levels, we will identify phenotypes at risk for more severe prognosis, as well as targets for future therapies. The proposed web-based system, the Data Storage for Computation and Integration (DSCI), will remotely compute machine learning, image analysis, and advanced statistics from prospectively collected longitudinal data on patients with TMJ OA. Due to its ubiquitous design in the web, DSCI software installation will no longer be required. Our long-term goal is to create software and data repository for Osteoarthritis of the TMJ. Such repository requires maintaining the data in a distributed computational environment to allow contributions to the database from multi-clinical centers and to share trained models for TMJ classification. In years 4 and 5 of the proposed work, the dissemination and training of clinicians at the Schools of Dentistry at the University of North Carol, Univ. of Minnesota and Oregon Health Sciences will allow expansion of the proposed studies. In Aim 1, we will test state-of-the-art neural network structures to develop a combined software module that will include the most efficient and accurate neural network architecture and advanced statistics to mine imaging, clinical and biological TMJ OA markers identified at baseline. In Aim 2, we propose to develop novel data analytics tools, evaluating the performance of various machine learning and statistical predictive models, including customized- Gaussian Process Regression, extreme boosted trees, Multivariate Varying Coefficient Model, Lasso, Ridge and Elastic net, Random Forest, pdfCluster, decision tree, and support vector machine. Such automated solutions will leverage emerging computing technologies to determine risk indicators for OA progression in longitudinal cohorts of TMJ health and disease.

"A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney Project Summary  Despite the widespread prevalence of ultrasound imaging in hospitals today, the clinical utility of ultrasound guidance is severely hampered by clutter and reverberation artifacts that obscure structures of interest and com- plicate anatomical measurements. Clutter is particularly problematic in overweight and obese individuals, who account for 78.6 million adults and 12.8 million children in North America. Similarly, interventional procedures of- ten require insertion of one or more metal tools, which generate reverberation artifacts that obfuscate instrument location, orientation, and geometry, while obscuring nearby tissues, thus additionally hampering ultrasound im- age quality. Although artifacts are problematic, ultrasound continues to persist primarily because of its greatest strengths (i.e., mobility, cost, non-ionizing radiation, real-time visualization, and multiplanar views) in comparison to existing image-guidance options, but it would be signiﬁcantly more useful without problematic artifacts.  Our long-term project goal is to use state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to provide interventional radiologists with artifact-free ultrasound-based images. We will initially develop a new framework alternative to the ultrasound beamforming process that removes needle tip reverberations and acoustic clutter caused by multipath scattering in near-ﬁeld tissues when guiding needles to the kidney to enable removal of painful kidney stones. Our ﬁrst aim will test convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that input raw channel data and output human readable images with no artifacts caused by multipath scattering and reverberations. A secondary goal of the CNNs is to learn the minimum number of parameters required to create these new CNN-based images. Our second aim will validate the trained algorithms with ultrasound data from experimental phantom and ex vivo tissue. Our third aim will extend our evaluation to ultrasound images of in vivo porcine kidneys. This work is the ﬁrst to propose bypassing the entire beamforming process and replacing it with machine learning and computer vision techniques to remove traditionally problematic noise artifacts and create a fundamentally new type of artifact-free, high-contrast, high-resolution, ultrasound-based image for guiding interventional procedures.  This work combines the expertise of an imaging scientist, a computer scientist, and an interventional ra- diologist to explore an untapped, understudied area that is only recently made feasible through improvements in computing power, advances in computer vision capabilities, and new knowledge about dominant sources of image degradation. Translation to in vivo cases is enabled by our clinical collaboration with the Department of Radiology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. With support from the NIH Trailblazer Award, our team will be the ﬁrst to develop these tools and capabilities to eliminate noise artifacts in interventional ultrasound, opening the door to a new paradigm in ultrasound image formation, which will directly beneﬁt millions of patients with clearer, easier-to-interpret ultrasound images. Subsequent R01 funding will customize our innovation to addi- tional application-speciﬁc ultrasound procedures (e.g., breast biopsies, cancer detection, autonomous surgery). Project Narrative Artifacts in ultrasound images, speciﬁcally artifacts caused by multipath scattering and acoustic reverberations (which occur when imaging through the abdominal tissue of overweight and obese patients or visualizing metallic surgical tools), remain as a major clinical challenge. There are no existing solutions to eliminate these artifacts based on today's signal processing techniques. The goal of this project is to step away from conventional signal processing models and instead learn from raw data examples with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques that differentiate artifacts from true signals, and thereby deliver clearer, easier-to-interpret images.",A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney,9913520,R21EB025621,"['Abdomen', 'Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Biopsy', 'Breast biopsy', 'Bypass', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cardiac', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Cyst', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family suidae', 'Fatty Liver', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interventional Ultrasonography', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Liver diseases', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Needles', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Nonionizing Radiation', 'North America', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Overweight', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Readability', 'Resolution', 'Retroperitoneal Space', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surgical Instruments', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'clinical effect', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'fetal', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'imaging scientist', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metallicity', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'signal processing', 'tool']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,235027,807432003,-0.003949835772968807
"Artificial Intelligence for Assessment of Stargardt Macular Atrophy Project Abstract Stargardt disease is the most frequent form of inherited juvenile macular degeneration. Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) is a widely available imaging technique which may aid in the diagnosis of Stargardt disease and is commonly used to monitor its progression. FAF imaging provides an in vivo assay of the retinal layers, but is only an indirect measure. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), in contrast, provides three-dimensional visualization of the retinal microstructure, thereby allowing it to be assessed directly and individually in eyes with Stargardt disease. At a retinal disease endpoints meeting with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November of 2016, a reliable measure of the anatomic status of the integrity of the ellipsoid zone (EZ) in the retina, was proposed to be a potential suitable regulatory endpoint for therapeutic intervention clinical trials. Manual segmentation/identification of the EZ band, particularly in 3-D OCT images, has proven to be extremely tedious, time-consuming, and expensive. Automated objective segmentation techniques, such as an approach using a deep learning - artificial intelligence (AI) construct, would be of significant value. Moreover, Stargardt disease may cause severe visual loss in children and young adults. Early prediction of Stargardt disease progression may facilitate new therapeutic trials. Thus, this proposal develops an AI-based approach for automated Stargardt atrophy segmentation and the prediction of atrophy progression in FAF and OCT images. More specifically, we first register the longitudinal FAF and OCT enface images respectively, and register the cross-sectional FAF to OCT image. We then develop a 2-D approach for Stargardt atrophy segmentation from FAF images using an AI approach and a 3-D approach for EZ band segmentation from OCT images using a 3-D graph-based approach. Finally, an AI-based approach is developed to predict subsequent development of new Stargardt atrophy or progression of existing atrophy from the OCT EZ band thickness and intensity features of the current patient visit. Project Narrative Stargardt disease is an inherited juvenile-onset macular dystrophy that may cause severe visual loss in children and young adults, thereby causing enormous morbidity with economic, psychological, emotional, and social implications. Early prediction of Stargardt disease progression may facilitate new therapeutic trials.

"Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema Approximately 25% of the millions of veterans (est. 8.92 million FY 2013) enrolled for care in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have diabetes mellitus, and diabetic macular edema (DME) is the leading cause of vision loss in the adult diabetic population world-wide. Although diabetic retinopathy has been well-studied, comparatively little is known about the burden of DME. In fact, only two national prevalence studies and no national study on the incidence of DME in persons with type 2 diabetes have been conducted. Similarly many risk factors have been characterized for DR, but no large studies have established predictors for DME.  Beyond the Medicare claims database, the VHA National Patient Care Database (NPCD) contains standardized administrative data for several aspects of patient care including diagnoses, procedures, medications, lab test results, vital signs, clinical text notes, and mortality. Because the VA uses teleretinal screening as routine clinical care for all patients with diabetes with these results included in the NPCD, the NPCD is an ideal source for studying the epidemiology of and risk factors for DME.  This study proposes to determine the burden of diabetic macular edema, establish risk factors, and examine treatment outcomes in a previously extracted dataset on 1.98 million veterans who have undergone diabetic retinopathy screening at least once since 2004. Currently invaluable ophthalmic data are encoded in unstructured clinical encounter notes in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), and no validated automated extraction method exists to capture these data elements. An automated extraction method using natural language processing will be created and validated to unlock key ophthalmic variables. These text extraction methods will be applicable to extracting ophthalmology data from not only notes of patients with DME but also any ophthalmology clinical note. This will enable future large scale studies in ophthalmology using NPCD and be immediately valuable to the research community at large.  The candidate, Dr. Aaron Lee, MD MSCI, is an ophthalmologist with subspecialty training in retina surgery with a strong background in computer science and epidemiology. His career goal is to become an independent clinician scientist studying diabetic eye disease with large-scale electronic medical record extracted data. While he possesses the foundational skills, he seeks to gain training in advanced statistics and natural language processing to unlock the data captured in unstructured clinical encounter notes. He has assembled an outstanding mentorship team under the primary mentor, Dr. Edward Boyko, MD MPH. This mentorship team includes renowned experts in clinical epidemiology, health informatics, ophthalmology, and natural language processing. This K23 will provide Dr. Lee the structured coursework, mentorship, and applied learning needed to acquire new research skills. He will leverage key local resources to carry out the proposed research at the University of Washington and the VA Seattle Epidemiologic Research and Information Center. Despite the significant visual loss associated with diabetic macular edema, little is known about the frequency of its occurrence, its risk factors, and the real-world effectiveness of existing treatments. The purpose of this proposed research is to utilize the VA National Patient Care Database to extract relevant data elements to examine these three clinical questions: 1) what is the incidence and prevalence of diabetic macular edema, 2) what are the risk factors associated with its development, and 3) what is the comparative real-world effectiveness of its treatments, including intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, intravitreal corticosteroid therapy and macular laser.

"Associating retinal nerve fiber layer thickness with glucose metabolism and diabetic retinopathy Project Summary/Abstract Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a metabolic disease that affects over 300 million people worldwide and that can be accompanied by serious health complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, stroke, and damage to the eyes, in particular diabetic retinopathy (DR), which is diagnosed in a third of people with diabetes and which is the leading cause of blindness within the age group between 20 and 64 years. T2DM is clinically diagnosed by parameters related to glucose metabolism obtained by blood tests. Due to its long pre- symptomatic phase, an estimate of 25% of diabetics in the US are undiagnosed. In this project, the relationship between spatial patterns of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness (RNFLT), measured by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), and blood test levels as well as levels of DR severity is investigated in 9,261 participants of a population based study.  In a first step, OCT RNFLT measurements of the macular and the circumpapillary area around optic nerve head are segmented into spatial sectors, and representative spatial patterns of RNFLT are calculated by an unsupervised machine learning method. Afterwards, a multivariate linear model comparison is performed with the coefficients of the spatial RNFLT patterns as regressors and diagnostic blood test results as dependent variable. The optimal combination of the RNFLT patterns, determined by an established model selection criterion (Bayes Factor), is expected to reveal insight into the association between the specific retinal locations of RNFL thinning accompanying the change in parameters related glucose metabolism during the development and progression of T2DM. Furthermore, fundus images are graded by DR severity following a nine-step scale derived from the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study from no DR to severe proliferative DR. The spatial RNFLT patterns and metabolic blood test scores are then compared with respect to modeling DR severity by linear regression. An optimal model of DR severity combining glucose metabolism parameters and RNFLT patterns is developed. Finally, in an analogous procedure, DR severity of the follow-up measurement, five years after baseline, is statistically predicted from RNFLT and metabolic blood parameters and from their change over time.  To summarize, the proposed research identifies spatial patterns of RNFLT associated with parameters of glucose metabolism and their development over DR severity. Once accomplished, the proposed project would provide the details to establish RNFLT as an alternative manifestation of T2DM that complements diagnostic blood tests and thereby, for instance, lay the foundations for the development of novel and more accurate T2DM progression monitoring or the prediction of the onset of DR. Project Narrative Parameters related to glucose metabolism obtained by blood tests are clinically used to diagnose diabetes, a metabolic disease that affects over 300 million people worldwide and that can be accompanied by serious health complications, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), the leading cause of blindness within the age group between 20 and 64 years. Decreased levels of blood glucose tolerance have been associated with retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning, but these results were based on comparisons between small populations of diagnosed diabetics and healthy controls, and RNFL was typically represented by coarse summary parameters which neglect retinal anatomy. This project contributes directly and immediately to public health by exploring the relationship between spatial patterns of RNFL thickness, present and future DR severity, and diagnostic blood test results in 9,261 participants of a population based study, with the final goal to establish and quantify RNFL thickness as an alternative manifestation of diabetes that complements diagnostic blood tests and lays the foundations for the development of novel and more accurate disease progression monitoring or the prediction of DR onset.",Associating retinal nerve fiber layer thickness with glucose metabolism and diabetic retinopathy,10002287,R21EY030631,"['Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Blindness', 'Blood', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Tests', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early treatment', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'OGTT', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Retina', 'Scanning', 'Selection Criteria', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Stroke', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Validation', 'age group', 'archetypal analysis', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'diabetic', 'fasting plasma glucose', 'follow-up', 'fundus imaging', 'glucose metabolism', 'glucose tolerance', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'macula', 'neglect', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'proliferative diabetic retinopathy', 'public health relevance', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'unsupervised learning']",NEI,SCHEPENS EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2020,240285,12024944,0.0067603567115366945
"Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This “Pathway to Independence” award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position. Ultimately, she aims to become a faculty member in a radiology or bioengineering institute, where she can further research technical biomedical imaging and machine learning developments applied to the musculoskeletal system. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morphological and compositional MRI quantifications are widely used tools to detect early cartilage degeneration and to study disease progression of osteoarthritis, a complex and multifactorial disorder.

"Machine learning driven transthoracic echocardiographic analysis and screening for cardiac amyloidosis Machine learning driven transthoracic echocardiographic analysis and screening for cardiac amyloidosis Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is a serious but increasingly treatable cause of heart failure. Autopsy studies have estimated the prevalence of CA at approximately 25% of all octogenarians, and 15 to 20% of patients with aortic stenosis. Despite the increasing prevalence of CA within the general population and specific subpopulations, its diagnosis as a cause of heart failure is hampered by under recognition and subsequent underdiagnosis in clinical practice. Data suggest that the average time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis is 2 years and that patients report seeing an average of 5 physicians prior to establishing a definitive diagnosis. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) testing is the most common initial evaluation because of its wide availability. A recent utilization review in the Medicare population indicated over 7 Million echocardiographic tests are performed each year accounting for $1.2 Billion in healthcare costs. TTEs provide comprehensive information about cardiac structure and function, yet complexity of interpretation has limited its screening performance in patients with CA, and diagnosis can be challenging. Thus, our group seeks to offer a computer vision and machine learning based TTE analysis and screening solution for CA. We are uniquely positioned for accelerated development with a cohort of 359 patients with confirmed CA and 4,862 controls. In Phase I, we will build a deep learning neural network-based image processing pipeline. It maps the TTE sequence into a 2-dimensional space that allows for the identification of the 4-chamber peak diastolic and peak systolic images within the cardiac heartbeat cycle. This will enable our screening model to recognize regional myocardial wall motion changes and hypertrophic patterns that characterize amyloidosis in comparison to controls with normal cardiac function. The operational point defining the performance characteristics of our screening-oriented model (including sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value) will be optimized using an average weighted accuracy (AWA) approach which accounts for CA disease prevalence along with a desired false positive and false negative tradeoff. If we are successful, we envision a Phase II proposal to build and deploy an automated TTE analysis tool, and to evaluate it in a multi- center clinical study. This sets the stage for our long-term goal to implement a computer assisted TTE screening solution to improve identification and by extension care of patients with cardiac amyloidosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE While non-invasive echocardiography is a first line tool for diagnosis for many cardiovascular symptoms, it is underutilized for less common diseases such as cardiac amyloidosis which recently has been shown to be increasingly prevalent in general and specific subpopulations. In this project, we will develop and validate a novel computer-assistive echocardiographic analysis tool to recognize the presence of cardiac amyloidosis. It is our hope that this technology will enhance the screening and subsequent diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis, ultimately, leading to improved patient outcomes.",Machine learning driven transthoracic echocardiographic analysis and screening for cardiac amyloidosis,10081836,R43HL154896,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Age-Years', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloidosis', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Awareness', 'Biopsy', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Echocardiography', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Laboratories', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Multi-site clinical study', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Myocardial', 'Octogenarian', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Review Literature', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Utilization Review', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'case control', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'genetic analysis', 'heart function', 'image processing', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'neural network', 'neural network classifier', 'novel', 'point of care', 'screening', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,"VIGILANT MEDICAL, INC.",R43,2020,249373,951823,-0.004269340416255765
"Development of a prototype software for automated PET/CT interpretation and reporting in thoracic cancer Abstract. In cancer, body-wide FDG-PET/CT is a prime modality for diagnosis, staging, and treatment assessment. Despite its paramount importance to enable precision medicine in cancer, no method is currently available for automated disease burden estimation and standardized reporting on PET/CT images regionally and globally in anatomic organs and lymph node zones within a body region or body-wide. Automated production- mode body-wide/ body-region-wide disease measurement with standardized reporting will foster cancer research discovery and will be of great interest to oncologists, radiologists/ nuclear medicine physicians, Medicare and private health insurers, and pharmaceutical companies that conduct clinical trials of new cancer therapeutics and currently rely on manual methods of response assessment. The overarching goal of this Phase I project is, therefore, to develop, validate, and demonstrate a prototype software for disease measurement and reporting via FDG-PET/CT in the above manner in one body region, namely thorax, based on innovative algorithms that are generalizable body-wide. The project has two aims: Aim 1: Develop, implement, and validate algorithms for disease burden estimation in thoracic cancer via FDG-PET/CT. Aim 2: Develop and demonstrate a prototype software implementing the above algorithms for disease measurement and reporting. Aim 1 will be accomplished in 3 stages: Tasks 1, 2: PET/CT image data sets which are radiologically near normal for the thoracic body region will be gathered from existing whole-body scans of 100 patients. In these data sets, 7 key anatomic organs and 5 key lymph node zones in the thorax will be delineated under expert guidance. These data will be used to build population fuzzy anatomy models following our established Automatic Anatomy Recognition (AAR) methodology. An additional 100 whole-body PET/CT scans of patients with different types of cancer will be gathered to test our methods. Using available commercial clinical software, the PET uptake properties of lesions in organs and diseased lymph nodes in lymph node zones will be measured manually and used as reference ground truth of disease burden. Task 3: Deep learning (DL) algorithms anatomically guided by AAR will be developed to very accurately localize (but not delineate) organs and lymph node zones in PET/CT images using the models. Task 4: Novel methods based on fuzzy principles will be developed to automatically tag and quantify pathological regions (without explicitly delineating them) within located organs and nodal zones, and the accuracy of disease measurement will be evaluated (Task 5). Aim 2 will be accomplished by incorporating the disease measurement methodology into a prototype software named AAR-DQ (Tasks 6, 7) based on our earlier software platform CAVASS. AAR-DQ will report disease burden in a hierarchical manner – (i) at the body-region level; (ii) at each organ/ lymph node zone level; (ii) at each lesion/ lymph node level. Expected milestones. Aim 1: AAR-DQ disease measurement not to deviate more than 10% from clinical ground truth measurement. Aim 2: Disease measurement/ reporting in under 5 minutes per patient PET/CT study. Automated production-mode body-wide/ body-region-wide disease measurement has numerous potential applications in cancer and other diseases and has considerable commercial potential.

"Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers Project Summary Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) has been proposed as a technique to quantify tissue parameters, such as T1 and T2 relaxation times, which are biomarkers for various pathologies. One assumption of MRF is that the signal in each voxel is generated by exactly one set of tissue parameters. Due to MRI resolution at the range of millimeter in combination with the cellular structure of biological tissue, each voxel consists of multiple tissue compartments. An over-simplified single compartment model results in apparent relaxation times that are influenced by the relaxation times and the fractional proton densities of all contributing compartments. This can lead to a misinterpretation of signal changes. For example, in diseases that causes demyelination in white matter (Multiple Sclerosis, Dementia), a reduction of the myelin water fraction would result in a misleading change of the apparent relaxation time of the voxel. We propose a multi-compartment MRF method that allows to identify multiple tissue contributions within a voxel, including the fractional proton density (PD) of different compartments. Our machine learning based approach automatically identifies the number of compartments within each voxel that can be identified with the available SNR in that voxel. We will correct for partial-volume effects at the borders of two types of tissues, as well as analyze tissue microstructure. For the second case our learned model will also include chemical exchange between compartments. After an initial validation phase using numerical simulations, we will first perform MRF scans of dedicated 3D printed phantoms with multiple compartments. Our quality criterion is successful estimation of all simulated tissue compartments for all voxels with a relative error of less than 5% to the ground truth. We will then perform in-vivo MRF measurements of healthy volunteers (n=5). We will generate synthetic FLAIR and MP-RAGE contrasts from parameter maps estimated with conventional and the proposed multi-compartment MRF technique. We will compare them with currently used clinical contrasts acquired using established pulse sequences and validate the performance of our approach by measuring the cortical thickness. Further, we will validate the performance for microstructure composition in white matter. Our hypothesis is that it will be possible separate the compartments for myelin, intra- and extra-cellular water and compare the results to ex-vivo data found in literature. In summary, the methods developed in this R21 proposal will provide a novel technique to accurately and reproducibly identify biomarkers beyond the resolution of a voxel. It will allow to identify changes in tissue composition and fractional proton density at the microstructure level. Project Narrative The overarching goal of this proposal is to establish a MR imaging technique for quantifying biomarkers at the sub-voxel level. We will develop a machine learning based MR fingerprinting image reconstruction that enables the identification and characterization of multiple compartments within a voxel in terms of fractional proton density and relaxation times. We will generate accurate synthetic fluid suppressed images such as the FLAIR and MP- RAGE with accurate partial volume behavior and analyze the myelin water fraction and the corresponding relaxation times in white matter.",Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers,10016296,R21EB027241,"['3D Print', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Demyelinations', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Fingerprint', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Protons', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Water', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'gray matter', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'millimeter', 'neuroimaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'physical process', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'tissue biomarkers', 'white matter']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2020,252175,329565273,-0.01103067467829661
"Sleep metrics from machine learning for Alzheimer's disease diagnostics PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is responsive to NIH solicitation PA-17-089 for projects involving secondary analysis of pre-existing geriatric datasets. While presently there is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, existing literature indicates that early diagnosis in the preclinical stage, i.e., before the onset of clinical symptoms, will be key to treatments. There is a pressing need for noninvasive predictors of cognitive decline that can enable early identification of individuals at Alzheimer’s disease risk. A mounting body of scientific evidence suggests that sleep disturbances (including microarchitectural disruptions to non-rapid-eye-motion sleep and decline in sleep quality) might be the earliest observable symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. On-the-go sleep and activity monitoring could address the need for noninvasive indicators of cognitive decline in subjects who are in the (asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic) preclinical stage of Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we will build on preliminary results that reveal a set of sleep features derived from polysomnography (PSG) that are predictive of cognitive performance. We are proposing to perform secondary analysis of sleep and cognition data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort using state-of-the-art deep learning tools to enable sleep-based prediction of cognitive impairment for early detection of Alzheimer’s disease. While PSG is the gold standard for sleep measurement, it is not well- suited for routine, day-to-day use. In comparison, wrist-based measurements (e.g. actigraphy, heart rate, ECG, and pulse oximetry) obtained from wearable devices allow “on-the-go” sleep monitoring. The combination of these on-the-go measures with the latest artificial intelligence tools is a feasible route to early Alzheimer’s diagnostics. We will use attention-guided long short-term memory autoencoders to identify overt and latent characteristics of the raw time-series datasets, which will allow us to more effectively mine the rich MESA data resource. Our deep learning framework will also take into account sociodemographic variables, indicators of health status, and medications. To ensure scientific rigor, secondary validation of the MESA-trained deep learning models will be performed on PSG and actigraphy data from the Harvard Aging Brain Study, which is a longitudinal study designed to further our understanding of what differentiates normal aging from preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. To address any concern about the “black-box” nature of deep learning models, we will compare the learned feature set with sleep microarchitectural features previously computed using classical statistical techniques. Previous data suggests that a subject’s apolipoprotein ε4 (ApoE4) allele carrier status influences the degree to which their sleep patterns impact their cognitive abilities. We will verify this by incorporating ApoE4 status as an additional input to the deep learning model. Literature shows that over 60% of patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease have at least one clinical sleep disorder. The on-the-go prediction paradigm using noninvasive sleep measurements to be validated in this project will have a significant impact on early Alzheimer’s diagnostics and facilitate ongoing clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sleep disturbances are a common feature of dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease. Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease before the onset of symptoms would be critically important for disease management and therapeutics. In this R21 Exploratory Analyses Grant, we propose to develop and validate state-of-the-art deep learning tools to discover novel sleep-based predictors for Alzheimer’s disease through secondary analysis of sleep, activity, and cognitive data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort of human subjects.",Sleep metrics from machine learning for Alzheimer's disease diagnostics,10042952,R21AG068890,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Apolipoproteins', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health Status Indicators', 'Heart Rate', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Polysomnography', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Research Design', 'Route', 'Series', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'aging brain', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'carrier status', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'improved', 'long short term memory', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'sleep pattern', 'sleep quality', 'sociodemographic variables', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R21,2020,256922,7208224,-0.07383790571465533
"Development of a Fast Large Area Multiphoton Exoscope (FLAME) Summary. Our long-term goal is to develop a powerful tool based on multiphoton microscopy (MPM) for non- invasive human skin imaging in order to improve clinical diagnosis, guide effective treatment and advance clinical and cosmetic/pharmaceutical research by providing access to dynamic cellular and molecular processes during therapy. MPM is a nonlinear optical imaging technique that provides unique structural and molecular contrast based on endogenous signals such as second harmonic generation from collagen and two- photon excited fluorescence from NADH/FAD+, keratin, melanin and elastin fibers. This contrast allows MPM to provide multi-color, rich molecular information content images that can enhance diagnostic accuracy. MPM overcomes fundamental limitations of existing optical imaging technologies for sub-surface skin imaging and extends the area of applicability beyond skin lesions that can be diagnosed through morphological assessment alone. Validation of the clinical potential of this technology has been facilitated over the past 10 years by a device developed by Jenlab in Germany, currently the only clinical MPM system on the market. This device has technical limitations in terms of field-of-view (FOV), imaging speed, complexity and cost, which are major barriers to clinical adoption. The goal of this Phase I proposal is to develop and test the technical feasibility for in vivo human skin imaging of a MPM system that is highly optimized for rapid, label-free, macroscopic imaging of human skin with microscopic resolution. The Fast Large Area Multiphoton Exoscope (FLAME) imaging platform will incorporate the innovative optical engine of a benchtop prototype developed at BLI. InfraDerm will innovate on this design to transform it into a compact, portable device, suitable for human skin imaging in clinical setting. Key innovations include: 1) a compact engineering design based on integrating a compact fs fiber laser into the imaging head along with a customized folded optical design to reduce complexity and cost and enhance portability; 2) hardware and software strategies that include a customized patient interface and a combination of optical and mechanical scanning mechanisms with deep learning image restoration to allow millimeter-to-centimeter scale imaging within minutes while maintaining sub-micron resolution. This approach will expand the in vivo imaging area from mm to cm scale, which will be scanned within minutes with sub- cellular resolution. In Aim 1 we will develop the FLAME prototype that incorporates these features. In Aim 2 we will test its technical feasibility for in vivo human skin imaging by evaluating potential effects of motion artifacts. In Aim 3, we will demonstrate the FLAME system potential for non-invasive assessment of melanin content, an ability with potential impact in differential diagnosis and early assessment of treatment efficacy of pigmentary skin disorders, such as melasma. Phase II will refine the technological approach and will test the device feasibility in a first clinical application, differential diagnosis of patients with melasma, a long time dermatology challenge and a particular interest for pharma companies developing therapies for this skin condition. Narrative  InfraDerm LLC proposes to develop and test the technical feasibility for in vivo human skin imaging of a laser scanning microscope based on multiphoton microscopy (MPM) that addresses fundamental and technical limitations of existing optical imaging technologies for sub-surface skin imaging, extending the area of applicability beyond skin lesions that can be diagnosed through morphological assessment alone. The proposed Fast Large Area Multiphoton Exoscope (FLAME) prototype will be highly optimized for rapid, label- free, macroscopic imaging of human skin with microscopic resolution. An MPM clinical platform, uniquely equipped with this combination of features would embody an innovative and commercially viable product that will broadly impact clinical diagnosis and research in dermatology as well as in cosmetic and pharmaceutical research.",Development of a Fast Large Area Multiphoton Exoscope (FLAME),10153566,R43EB030931,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Alopecia', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biopsy', 'Cell physiology', 'Chloasma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collagen', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Cosmetics', 'Custom', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disclosure', 'Elastin', 'Elastin Fiber', 'Excision', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Face', 'Fiber', 'Fluorescence', 'Generations', 'Germany', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Keratin', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Legal patent', 'Lesion', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Melanins', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'NADH', 'Nevus', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Pigments', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effective therapy', 'engineering design', 'human imaging', 'image guided', 'image guided therapy', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'millimeter', 'multiphoton imaging', 'multiphoton microscopy', 'optical imaging', 'portability', 'prototype', 'response', 'restoration', 'second harmonic', 'skin disorder', 'skin lesion', 'submicron', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NIBIB,"INFRADERM, LLC",R43,2020,263074,263074,-0.010749409348619109
"FAIR-CT: a practical approach to enable ultra-low dose CT for longitudinal disease and treatment monitoring Project Abstract/Summary Ultra-low dose CT, defined as sub-millisievert (sub-mSv) imaging of the entire chest, abdomen or pelvis, is critically needed for healthcare of patients with chronic diseases and cancer. Unfortunately, photon starvation and electronic noise make imaging at such dose levels challenging. Photon starvation refers to the number of transmitted photons. When no photons are transmitted, the measurement is essentially useless. If few photons are transmitted, the measurement carries information, but its interpretation and value are confounded by electronic noise. Solutions with encouraging results have been offered for sub-mSv chest imaging, but these are not widely available and not easily generalizable across anatomical sites, vendors and scanner models. We propose a novel, robust solution for ultra-low dose CT that will overcome these issues. We refer to our solution as FAIR-CT, which stands for Finite-Angle Integrated-Ray CT. FAIR-CT operates under the principle that photon starvation and the confounding effect of electronic noise are best handled by avoiding them, which is made possible by increasing the data integration time during the source-detector rotation. FAIR-CT data strongly deviate from the classical CT data model and share the streak artifact problem of sparse view sampling. FAIR-CT data acquisition also affects azimuthal resolution. We anticipate that these issues can be suitably handled using advanced image reconstruction techniques. Once available, FAIR-CT will allow improvements in longitudinal monitoring of patients with chronic diseases such as COPD, urolithiasis and diabetes, thereby reducing mortality and co-morbidities. FAIR-CT will also allow advancing cancer therapy treatments by enabling adjustments in radiation therapy plans between dose fractions without increasing CT radiation exposure, and by facilitating early detection of inflammations in drug-based therapies. To bring FAIR-CT towards fruition, we will work on two specific aims: (1) Creation of a comprehensive collection of FAIR-CT data sets enabling rigorous development, validation and evaluation of image reconstruction algorithms; (2) Development, validation and evaluation of advanced image reconstruction algorithms. The FAIR-CT data sets will involve the utilization of state-of-the-art scanners and include real patient data synthesized from high dose scans acquired for standard of care. Two complementary image reconstruction approaches will be investigated. Namely, model-based iterative reconstruction with non-linear forward model and dedicated compressed sensing regularization; and deep learning-based refinement of FBP reconstructions using target images with task-adapted image quality. Image quality evaluation will account for critical biological variables and involve objective metrics such as structure similarity and contrast-to-noise ratio for clinically-proven lesions, as well as task-based performance metrics involving human readers. Ultra-low dose X-ray computed tomography is critically needed for healthcare of patients with chronic diseases and cancer. Unfortunately, physics-related challenges and impractical solutions make this concept unavailable for everyday clinical use. We will develop a novel solution that is practical and can quickly be brought to clinical practice.",FAIR-CT: a practical approach to enable ultra-low dose CT for longitudinal disease and treatment monitoring,9877188,R21EB029179,"['Abdomen', 'Academia', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Body mass index', 'Chest', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computers', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Fruit', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Industry', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Lesion', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Noise', 'Obesity', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Photons', 'Physics', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Inflammation', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Starvation', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'clinically translatable', 'comorbidity', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'expectation', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'low dose computed tomography', 'mortality', 'novel', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'side effect', 'standard of care', 'targeted imaging', 'urolithiasis']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2020,265345,228951281,-0.013179209381101413
"Fine-grained spatial information extraction for radiology reports ABSTRACT Automated biomedical image classification has seen enormous improvements in performance over recent years, particularly in radiology. However, the machine learning (ML) methods that have achieved this remarkable performance often require enormous amounts of labeled data for training. An increasingly accepted means of acquiring this data is through the use of natural language processing (NLP) on the free-text reports associated with an image For example, take the following brain MRI report snippet:  There is evidence of left parietal encephalomalacia consistent with known history of prior stroke. Small  focal area of hemosiderin deposition along the lateral margins of the left lateral ventricle. Here, the associated MRI could be labeled for both Encephalomalacia and Hemosiderin. NLP methods to automatically label images in this way have been used to create several large image classification datasets However, as this example demonstrates, radiology reports often contain far more granular information than prior NLP methods attempted to extract. Both findings in the above example mention their anatomical location, which linguistically is referred to as a spatial grounding, as the location anchors the finding in a spatial reference. Further, the encephalomalacia finding is connected to the related diagnosis of stroke, while the hemosiderin finding provides a morphological description (small focal area). This granular information is important for image classification, as advanced deep learning methods are capable of utilizing highly granular structured data. This is logical, as for instance a lung tumor has a slightly different presentation than a liver tumor. If an ML algorithm can leverage both the coarse information (the general presentation of a tumor) while also recognizing the subtle granular differences, it can find an optimal balance between specificity and generalizability. From an imaging perspective, this can also be seen as a middle ground between image-level labels (which are cheap but require significant data for training—a typical dataset has thousands of images or more) and segmentation (which is expensive to obtain, but provides better training data—a typical dataset has 40 to 200 images), as the fine-grained spatial labels correspond to natural anatomical segments. Our fundamental hypothesis in this project is that if granular information can be extracted from radiology reports with NLP, this will improve downstream radiological image classification when training on a sufficiently large dataset. For radiology, the primary form of granularity is spatial (location, shape, orientation, etc.), so this will be the focus of our efforts. We further hypothesize that these NLP techniques will be generalizable to most types of radiology reports. For the purpose of this R21-scale project, however, we will focus on three distinct types of reports with different challenges: chest X-rays (one of the most-studied and largest-scale image classification types), extremity X-rays (which offer different findings than chest X-rays), and brain MRIs (which present a different image modality and the additional complexity of three dimensions). NARRATIVE This project is interested in developing natural language processing (NLP) methods for better understanding the spatial relationships described in the free text data within radiology reports found in electronic health record (EHR) systems. We will (i) develop an ontology, (ii) manually create a dataset for training NLP methods, (iii) develop automatic NLP methods compatible the ontology and corpus, and (iv) evaluate automatic image classification methods that use the output of the NLP system as image labels.",Fine-grained spatial information extraction for radiology reports,9957898,R21EB029575,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Encephalomalacia', 'Equilibrium', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hemosiderin', 'Human', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Left', 'Limb structure', 'Linguistics', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Location', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Performance', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Training', 'Trust', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'deep learning', 'design', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'lateral ventricle', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'radiological imaging', 'scale up', 'spatial relationship', 'structured data', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2020,271250,135644722,-0.025417561351829994
"Robust AI to develop risk models in retinopathy of prematurity using deep learning ROP is a retinal neovascular disease affecting preterm infants, and is a leading cause of childhood blindness worldwide. Known clinical risk factors include preterm birth, low birthweight and use of supplemental oxygen but improved risk models are needed to identify infants that progress to treatment requiring disease and blindness. Deep learning techniques have been used to successfully identify “plus” disease in multi- institutional cohorts and to provide a continuous measure of disease severity. A major limitation of deep learning, however, is the need for large amounts of well curated datasets. Other limitations include overfitting and “brittleness” that can cause model performance to drop on external data. There are, however, numerous barriers to building and hosting these large central repositories with multi-institutional data required for robust deep learning including concerns about data sharing, regulations costs, patient privacy and intellectual property. In this project, we aim to demonstrate the utility of distributed/federated deep learning approaches where the data are located within institutions, but model parameters are shared with a central server. A major challenge thwarting this research, however, is the requirement for large quantities of labeled image data to train deep learning models. Efforts to create large public centralized collections of image data are hindered by barriers to data sharing, costs of image de-identification, patient privacy concerns, and control over how data are used. Current deep learning models that are being built using data from one or a few institutions are limited by potential overfitting and poor generalizability. Instead of centralizing or sharing patient images, we aim to distribute the training of deep learning models across institutions with computations performed on their local image data. Specifically, we seek to build robust risk models for predicting treatment requiring disease. Two large cohorts will be used to validate the hypothesis that the performance of the risk models using distributed learning approaches that of centrally hosted and is more robust than models built on single institutional datasets.

"Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival  Chronic kidney disease affects about 10% of adults in the United States and 7-12% of the population worldwide. It may lead to irreversible loss of kidney function, known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD). For patients with ESRD, kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment compared to dialysis in terms of patient survival, quality of life and cost. Despite the advantages of kidney transplants, most patients with ESRD are treated with dialysis primarily because there exist an insufficient number of compatible donors for patients. The human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) of the organ donor and recipient are known to be a significant contributing factor to transplanted organ survival times due to immunogenicity, the immune response of the recipient to the transplanted organ. Mismatches between donor and recipient HLAs are associated with shorter survival times; however, it is extremely rare to identify donors that have a perfect match with recipients, so most transplants involve mismatched HLAs. Our main objective is to accurately predict survival times for kidney transplants by incorporating both data- driven models of HLA compatibility based on outcomes of past transplants and biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity. Accurate prediction of survival times can improve patient transplant outcomes by enabling more efficient allocation of donors and recipients, particularly by reducing the number of repeat transplants due to graft failure with a poorly matched donor. We propose to estimate HLA compatibilities using high-dimensional variable selection techniques applied to outcomes of past transplants and through a novel donor-recipient latent space model for the HLA compatibility network. We then propose to incorporate these predicted compatibilities along with biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity using amino acid sequences and epitopes into a multi-task classification-based survival prediction algorithm. Our proposed approach for learning integrated data- and biologically-driven models of transplant survival generalizes broadly to organ transplantation (liver, heart, pancreas, lungs) and possibly to bone marrow transplantation. Finding better methods for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching between donor and recipient may redefine and improve clinical outcomes for organ and tissue transplants. In fact, new approach may revolutionize the selection of donors with recipients, thereby producing significantly improved long-term organ and tissue transplant survivals.",Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival ,9985180,R01LM013311,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens', 'Anus', 'Biological', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Donor Selection', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epitopes', 'HLA Antigens', 'Heart', 'Immune response', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organ Donor', 'Organ Survival', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Science', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'base', 'cost', 'discrete time', 'graft failure', 'hazard', 'high dimensionality', 'human model', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'learning network', 'multitask', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'survival prediction', 'transplant model', 'treatment comparison']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO,R01,2020,277764,3094550,0.0002798683860076713

"Diabetic Retinopathy: genetics and neurodegeneration PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Diabetes mellitus (DM) is the leading cause of vision loss among working aged adults. Its prevalence is increasing and despite the strides in knowledge and treatments, our understanding of the pathways leading to vision loss in DM remains limited. Hyperglycemia and duration of DM contribute to but do not fully explain the predisposition to develop diabetic retinal diseases. Given the predisposition for diabetic retinal diseases to cluster in families, genetic risk factors are thought to be important but none has so far been definitively implicated. Furthermore, data from small studies suggest that there are more phenotypes of diabetic retinal disease than are currently recognized in clinical practice. Diabetic retinal disease has traditionally been considered primarily a vascular process: diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME) are the main clinical manifestations. With improved imaging modalities and image analysis algorithms, there has been increasing recognition of a new clinical manifestation of diabetic retinal disease, diabetic retinal neurodegeneration (DRN). This is visible as alterations in thickness of retinal nerve fiber (RNFL) and/or ganglion cell layer (GCL) on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. To date, DRN is poorly understood, and its role in clinical management of patients with DM has not been established. However, if retinal neurodegeneration occurs and is progressive, it can lead to profound visual difficulties for patients with DM. DRN may account for previously unexplained poor visual outcomes among patients with diabetic retinal disease despite standard of care treatment. Dr. Channa is a retina specialist, with prior research experience in retinal imaging and clinical trials of novel treatments for DME. In this K23 career development award she proposes to use a nationally representative dataset, the UK Biobank cohort to: 1) improve our understanding of DRN by determining RNFL and GCL thickness, using OCT imaging, in participants with DM (who have no DR or DME) compared to those who do not have DM 2) determine genetic factors associated with DR, DME and DRN. Dr. Channa proposes a career development plan, which includes mentorship, coursework, publications and clinical time. This will situate her as an independent clinician-scientist with expertise in translational research employing bioinformatics and computational skills in genomics and retinal image analysis to elucidate pathways of vision loss among patients with DM, ultimately leading to development of novel therapies. Her research work and career development will take place in the academic and collaborative environment of the largest medical center in the world, where she has institutional support and mentorship to develop as an independent clinician-scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this career development award we aim to use genetic and retinal imaging data to enhance our understanding of the pathways that can lead to vision loss among people with diabetic retinal diseases. Improved understanding will translate into interventions aimed at preventing blindness from diabetes.",Diabetic Retinopathy: genetics and neurodegeneration,9868630,K23EY030911,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Fundus', 'Future', 'Ganglion Cell Layer', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Nerve', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Retina', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Specialist', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'biobank', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'diabetes management', 'diabetic', 'disability', 'experience', 'family genetics', 'fiber cell', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'macular edema', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'population based', 'prevent', 'retinal imaging', 'screening', 'skills', 'standard of care']",NEI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K23,2020,290835,323604360,0.012661412244708781
"SCH: A Computer Vision and Lens-Free Imaging System for Automatic Monitoring of Infections Automated monitoring and screening of various physiological signals is an indispensable tool in modern medicine. However, despite the  preponderance of long-term monitoring and screening modalities for certain vital signals, there are a significant number of applications for  which no automated monitoring or screening is available. For example, patients in need of urinary catheterization are at significant risk of  urinary tract infections, but long-term monitoring for a developing infection while a urinary catheter is in place typically requires a caregiver to  frequently collect urine samples which then must be transported to a laboratory facility to be tested for a developing infection. Disruptive  technologies at the intersection of lens-free imaging, fluidics, image processing, computer vision and machine learning offer a tremendous  opportunity to develop new devices that can be connected to a urinary catheter to automatically monitor urinary tract infections. However, novel  image reconstruction, object detection and classification, and deep learning algorithms are needed to deal with challenges such as low image  resolution, limited labeled data, and heterogeneity of the abnormalities to be detected in urine samples. This project brings together a multidisciplinary team of computer scientists, engineers and clinicians to design, develop and test a system that integrates lens-free imaging, fluidics, image processing, computer vision and machine learning to automatically monitor urinary tract infections. The system will take a urine sample as an input, image the sample with a lens-free microscope as it flows through a fluidic channel, reconstruct the images using advanced holographic reconstruction algorithms, and detect and classify abnormalities, e.g., white blood cells, using advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms. Specifically, this project will: (1) design fluidic and optical hardware to appropriately sample urine from patient lines, flow the sample through the lens-free imager, and capture holograms of the sample; (2) develop holographic image reconstruction algorithms based on deep network architectures constrained by the physics of light diffraction to produce high quality images of the specimen from the lens-free holograms; (3) develop deep learning algorithms requiring a minimal level of manual supervision to detect various abnormalities in the fluid sample that might be indicative of a developing infection (e.g., the presence of white bloods cells or bacteria); and (4) integrate the above hardware and software developments into a system to be validated on urine samples obtained from patient discards against standard urine monitoring and screening methods. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This project could lead to the development of a low-cost device for automated screening and monitoring of urinary tract infections (the most  common hospital and nursing home acquired infection), and such a device could eliminate the need for patients or caregivers to manually collect  urine samples and transport them to a laboratory facility for testing and enable automated long-term monitoring and screening for UTIs. Early  detection of developing UTIs could allow caregivers to preemptively remove the catheter before the UTI progressed to the point of requiring  antibiotic treatment, thus reducing overall antibiotic usage. The technology to be developed in this project could also be used for screening  abnormalities in other fluids, such as central spinal fluid, and the methods to detect and classify large numbers of cells in an image could lead to  advances in large scale multi-object detection and tracking for other computer vision applications. n/a",SCH: A Computer Vision and Lens-Free Imaging System for Automatic Monitoring of Infections,10019459,R01AG067396,"['Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacteriuria', 'Caregivers', 'Catheters', 'Cations', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Erythrocytes', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Image', 'Infection', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modality', 'Modern Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Nursing Homes', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Urinalysis', 'Urinary Catheterization', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'classification algorithm', 'cost', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'diffraction of light', 'heterogenous data', 'hologram', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imager', 'imaging system', 'laboratory facility', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'particle', 'reconstruction', 'screening', 'software development', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,291252,807432003,-0.017310408461274202
"Antibody isotyping for discrimination of disease stage and diagnosis of early Lyme disease. ABSTRACT More than 3 million tests are performed each year to support the laboratory diagnosis of human Lyme disease (LD). While the CDC conventional standard two-tier (CSTT) approach for serodiagnosis of LD has worked relatively well when used as recommended, there is plenty of room for improvement. Of a number of weaknesses associated with the supplemental immunoblot of the CSTT the most significant is low reproducibility due to the subjective visual interpretation of results. To overcome these weaknesses the CDC recently updated its recommendations based on a modified STT (MSTT) in that a second EIA can replace the immunoblot. The major goal of this project is to develop an objective, quantitative, multiplex EIA that can detect four antibody isotypes (IgM/D/G/A) and all four IgG subclasses (IgG1/2/3/4) to leverage acquisition of simultaneous antibody profile information on multiple B. burgdorferi antigens to build an assay that can discriminate Lyme disease stage with increased overall sensitivity without incurring in loss of specificity. The novelty of this study relies on: 1) evaluation of B. burgdorferi antigen-specific antibody isotypes and IgG subclasses that can be correlated with Lyme disease stage; and 2) development of new diagnostic tools using machine learning techniques to train and integrate all data and produce an objective result to discriminate early Lyme from early disseminated/late Lyme disease. We expect this Phase I SBIR to allow us to develop a new EIA for serodiagnosis of Lyme disease (isoEIAplex-Ld) and to further an ongoing collaboration with DCN diagnostics for the adaptation of our biomarkers to a new rapid Lateral Flow Assay (see Letter of Support) for a follow up Phase II SBIR . NARRATIVE More than 3 million tests are performed each year to support the laboratory diagnosis of human Lyme disease. While the CDC conventional standard two-tier approach for serodiagnosis of Lyme disease has worked relatively well when used as recommended, there is plenty of room for improvement. We propose to develop an objective multiplex enzyme immunoassay that can detect four antibody isotypes (IgM/D/G/A) and all four IgG subclasses (IgG1/2/3/4) to leverage acquisition of simultaneous antibody profile information on multiple B. burgdorferi antigens and build an assay that can discriminate Lyme disease stage with increased overall sensitivity without incurring in loss of specificity.",Antibody isotyping for discrimination of disease stage and diagnosis of early Lyme disease.,10080461,R43AI155211,"['Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Affinity', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Arthritis', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Borrelia burgdorferi', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Specificity', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enzyme Immunoassay', 'Evaluation', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'IgA1', 'IgA2', 'IgE', 'IgG1', 'IgG2', 'IgG3', 'IgG4', 'Immune response', 'Immunodominant Antigens', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin D', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin Isotypes', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Infection', 'Iowa', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Diagnosis', 'Lateral', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Lyme Arthritis', 'Lyme Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'OspC protein', 'Patients', 'Peptidoglycan', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Proteins', 'ROC Curve', 'Recommendation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Serum', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Update', 'V(D)J Recombination', 'Visual', 'Work', 'antigen binding', 'base', 'commercialization', 'disease diagnosis', 'erythema migrans', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'tool']",NIAID,"IMMUNO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2020,298123,298123,-0.009353167465651928
"Automated image-based biomarker computation tools for diabetic retinopathy Abstract  In this project, we present EyeMark, a system with advanced longitudinal image anal- ysis tools for automated computation of biomarkers for diabetic retinopathy (DR) using retinal fundus images. Specifically, we have developed tools for computation of microan- eurysm (MA) appearance and disappearance rates (jointly known as turnover rates) for use as a biomarker in quantifying DR progression risk along with longitudinal analysis of other DR lesions. The availability of a reliable image-based biomarker will have high pos- itive influence on various aspects of DR care, including screening, monitoring progres- sion, drug discovery and clinical research.  Measuring MA turnover and longitudinal analysis of DR lesions involves two labor in- tensive steps: careful alignment of current and baseline images, and marking of individual lesions. This process is very time consuming and prone to error, if done entirely by human graders. The primary goal of this project is to overcome these limitations by automating both the steps involved in longitudinal analysis: accurate image registration, and lesion identification.  We have designed and developed a prototype tool that robustly registers longitudinal images (even with multiple lesion changes) and effectively detects and localizes DR le- sions. This fully automated tool can work on the cloud to produces results in near constant time (for large datasets), and also provide intuitive visualization tools for clinicians to more effectively monitor DR progression. This commercialization readiness pilot (CRP) project is intended to develop a regulatory strategy and a market access plan for EyeMark to enable its introduction in the US market and foster commercial success. Narrative The proposed tool, EyeMark, will greatly enhance the clinical care available to diabetic retinopathy (DR) patients by providing an automated tool for computation of an image- based, reliable, DR biomarker in a non-invasive manner. This will enable identification of patients who are at higher risk to progress to severe retinopathy, thus helping prevent vision loss in such patients by timely intervention. Early identification is especially important in face of long backlog of diabetic patients waiting for an eye examination, and the fact that 90% of vision loss can be saved by early identification. The availability of an effective biomarker will also positively influence the drug discovery process by facilitating early and reliable determination of biological efficacy of potential new therapies.",Automated image-based biomarker computation tools for diabetic retinopathy,10082344,SB1TR000377,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Appearance', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exudate', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Services', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Legal', 'Lesion', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Market Research', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Microaneurysm', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Price', 'Process', 'Prothrombin', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Retina', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Sales', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'diabetic patient', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'fundus imaging', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'high throughput analysis', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'longitudinal analysis', 'medical schools', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'payment', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'retinal imaging', 'screening', 'serial imaging', 'sound', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NCATS,"EYENUK, INC.",SB1,2020,300000,1300000,0.012388548172543907
"Image-guided Biocuration of Disease Pathways From Scientific Literature Realization of precision medicine ideas requires an unprecedented rapid pace of translation of biomedical discoveries into clinical practice. However, while many non-canonical disease pathways and uncommon drug actions, which are of vital importance for understanding individual patient-specific disease pathways, are accumulated in the literature, most are not organized in databases. Currently, such knowledge is curated manually or semi-automatically in a very limited scope. Meanwhile, the volume of biomedical information in PubMed (currently 28 million publications) keeps growing by more than a million articles per year, which demands more efficient and effective biocuration approaches.  To address this challenge, a novel biocuration method for automatic extraction of disease pathways from figures and text of biomedical articles will be developed.  Specific Aim 1: To develop focused benchmark sets of articles to assess the performance of the biocuration pipeline.  Specific Aim 2: To develop a method for extraction of components of disease pathways from articles’ figures based on deep-learning techniques.  Specific Aim 3: To develop a method for reconstruction of disease-specific pathways through enrichment and through graph neural network (GNN) approaches.  Specific Aim 4: To conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the pipeline.  The overarching goal of this project is to develop a computer-based automatic biocuration ecosystem for rapid transformation of free-text biomedical literature into a machine-processable format for medical applications.  The overall impact of the proposed project will be to significantly improve health outcomes in individualized patient cases by efficiently bringing the latest biomedical discoveries into a precision medicine setting. It will especially benefit cancer patients for which up-to-date knowledge of newly discovered molecular mechanisms and drug actions is critical.

"Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT With the introduction of many novel techniques to minimize radiation dose in CT, there is still a large variation in terms of radiation dose levels prescribed in CT exams and therefore a large variation of diagnostic performance. Some patients may receive higher dose than necessary. Some may be under-dosed and mis- diagnosed as a result of insufficient image quality. In order to determine the appropriate amount of radiation dose reduction in each exam, accurate quantification of diagnostic performance is needed so that the dose reduction can be achieved without sacrificing important diagnostic information. However, currently there is a lack of efficient and quantitative tools for objective assessment of diagnostic performance, particularly for many of the novel dose reduction methods involving non-linear processing of the data such as iterative reconstruction and deep-learning-based noise reduction methods. The specific goal of this application is to disseminate a highly automated solution, CT Protocol optimization (CTPro) software, to a wide CT community. This quantitative tool provides an efficient implementation of diagnostic performance assessment and CT radiation dose optimization. This tool is based on channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), which itself was developed decades ago to mimic human observer visual responses in signal detection tasks. However, the use of CHO in clinical CT is quite limited because of a lack of rigorous validation and efficient and robust implementation in practice. We were the first to demonstrate its correlation with human observer performance in low-contrast detection, classification and localization tasks in clinical CT. The main objective of the current proposal is to optimize this tool for simplicity and robustness, and disseminate it to CT researchers and clinical users, which will be accomplished through 3 specific aims: Aim 1: Optimize CTPro for simplicity, robustness, and generalizability. Aim 2: Develop an open-source web-based platform for software dissemination. Aim 3: Build use cases and disseminate CTPro. The proposed work is significant because the software tool will allow any CT users and researchers to perform CT radiation dose optimization and diagnostic performance evaluation in an efficient, quantitative, and objective manner. This work is innovative in that the automated tool will use quantitative measures of diagnostic performance to systematically guide the complex task of CT dose optimization, moving beyond traditional metrics that are inappropriate for many novel dose reduction techniques. The software tool, once widely employed, will facilitate a paradigm shift in how dose optimization and the evaluation of dose reduction techniques are performed, and will allow a more rapid and consistent adoption of dose reduction technology into clinical practice, which will benefit millions of CT patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a lack of quantitative tools for efficient and objective assessment of diagnostic performance in CT, which is the reason why inappropriate radiation dose is frequently used in CT exams, resulting in unnecessarily high radiation exposure to patients or lose of important diagnostic information. The purpose of this project is to disseminate a highly automated solution to a wide CT community for efficient CT radiation dose optimization. If successful, appropriate amount of radiation can be prescribed for millions of CT patients at any facility, while maintaining the level of diagnostic information required for high quality patient care.",Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment,10019348,U24EB028936,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Encapsulated', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Newsletter', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computerized data processing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'open source', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'symposium', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'web site']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U24,2020,314388,276703803,-0.010879874153219022
"Can machines be trusted? Robustification of deep learning for medical imaging Machine learning algorithms have become increasing popular in medical imaging, where highly functional algorithms have been trained to recognize patterns or features within image data sets and perform clinically relevant tasks such as tumor segmentation and disease diagnosis. In recent years, an approach known as deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning, by leveraging massive datasets and immense computing power to extract features from data. Deep learning is ideally suited for problems in medical imaging, and has enjoyed success in diverse tasks such as segmenting cardiac structures, tumors, and tissues. However, research in machine learning has also shown that deep learning is fragile in the sense that carefully designed perturbations to an image can cause the algorithm to fail. These perturbations can be designed to be imperceptible by humans, so that a trained radiologist would not make the same mistakes. As deep learning approaches gain acceptance and move toward clinical implementation, it is therefore crucial to develop a better understanding of the performance of neural networks. Specifically, it is critical to understand the limits of deep learning when presented with noisy or imperfect data. The goal of this project is to explore these questions in the context of medical imaging—to better identify strengths, weaknesses, and failure points of deep learning algorithms. We posit that malicious perturbations, of the type studied in theoretical machine learning, may not be representative of the sort of noise encountered in medical images. Although noise is inevitable in a physical system, the noise arising from sources such as subject motion, operator error, or instrument malfunction may have less deleterious effects on a deep learning algorithm. We propose to characterize the effect of these perturbations on the performance of deep learning algorithms. Furthermore, we will study the effect of random labeling error introduced into the data set, as might arise due to honest human error. We will also develop new methods for making deep learning algorithms more robust to the types of clinically relevant perturbations described above. In summary, although the susceptibility of neural networks to small errors in the inputs is widely recognized in the deep learning community, our work will investigate these general phenomena in the specific case of medical imaging tasks, and also conduct the first study of average-case errors that could realistically arise in clinical studies. Furthermore, we will produce novel recommendations for how to quantify and improve the resiliency of deep learning approaches in medical imaging. In recent years, an approach known as deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning by achieving superhuman performance on many tasks. As deep learning approaches gain acceptance and move toward clinical implementation in assisting radiologists for tasks such as segmentation of cardiac structures, tumors, and tissues, it is critical to understand the limits of deep learning when presented with noisy or imperfect data.

"Automated data curation to ensure model credibility in the Vascular Model Repository Three-dimensional anatomic modeling and simulation (3D M&S) in cardiovascular (CV) disease have become a crucial component of treatment planning, medical device design, diagnosis, and FDA approval. Comprehensive, curated 3-D M&S databases are critical to enable grand challenges, and to advance model reduction, shape analysis, and deep learning for clinical application. However, large-scale open data curation involving 3-D M&S present unique challenges; simulations are data intensive, physics-based models are increasingly complex and highly resolved, heterogeneous solvers and data formats are employed by the community, and simulations require significant high-performance computing resources. Manually curating a large open-data repository, while ensuring the contents are verified and credible, is therefore intractable. We aim to overcome these challenges by developing broadly applicable automated curation data science to ensure model credibility and accuracy in 3-D M&S, leveraging our team’s expertise in CV simulation, uncertainty quantification, imaging science, and our existing open data and open source projects. Our team has extensive experience developing and curating open data and software resources. In 2013, we launched the Vascular Model Repository (VMR), providing 120 publicly-available datasets, including medical image data, anatomic vascular models, and blood flow simulation results, spanning numerous vascular anatomies and diseases. The VMR is compatible with SimVascular, the only fully open source platform providing state-of-the-art image-based blood flow modeling and analysis capability to the CV simulation community. We propose that novel curation science will enable the VMR to rapidly intake new data while automatically assessing model credibility, creating a unique resource to foster rigor and reproducibility in the CV disease community with broad application in 3D M&S. To accomplish these goals, we propose three specific aims: 1) Develop and validate automated curation methods to assess credibility of anatomic patient-specific models built from medical image data, 2) Develop and validate automated curation methods to assess credibility of 3D blood flow simulation results, 3) Disseminate the data curation suite and expanded VMR. The proposed research is significant and innovative because it will 1) enable rapid expansion of the repository by limiting curator intervention during data intake, leveraging compatibility with SimVascular, 2) increase model credibility in the CV simulation community, 3) apply novel supervised and unsupervised approaches to evaluate anatomic model fidelity, 4) leverage reduced order models for rapid assessment of complex 3D data. This project assembles a unique team of experts in cardiovascular simulation, the developers of SimVascular and creator of the VMR, a professional software engineer, and radiology technologists. We will build upon our successful track record of launching and supporting open source and open data resources to ensure success. Data curation science for 3D M&S will have direct and broad impacts in other physiologic systems and to ultimately impact clinical care in cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular anatomic models and blood flow simulations are increasingly used for personalized surgical planning, medical device design, and the FDA approval process. We propose to develop automated data curation science to rapidly assess credibility of anatomic models and 3D simulation data, which present unique challenges for large-scale data curation.

"Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rationale. Diabetes is a leading cause of renal disease, accounting for 40% of the estimated 20 million US adult cases of chronic kidney disease. There is, however, substantial heterogeneity across diabetic patients with regards to development of kidney disease. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic biomarkers that can provide early and reliable evidence of future kidney disease, so that high-risk patients can receive optimal medical care. Existing clinical, proteomic and genomic markers do not consistently nor accurately predict kidney function decline. Metabolomics, a systematic evaluation of the end-products of cellular function in fluids, has the potential to inform physiological and pathological effects of chronic diseases. Metabolomic analysis combined with advanced quantitative methods could play a key role in building clinically useful prognostic signatures of diabetic kidney disease. Yet, development of computational methods with adequate rigor has lagged behind the technical capacity to perform large scale quantitative metabolomics. In this proposal we aim to address this computational gap in diabetic kidney disease research. Aims. We will implement rigorous computational methods to identify robust prognostic metabolite + clinical + genetic signatures of diabetic kidney disease progression. Specifically, we aim to (i) test the accuracy of previous signatures, and apply state-of-the-art analytic techniques and novel statistical methods to identify new multivariate metabolite sets for predicting kidney disease progression; (ii) quantify patterns of co-regulation of metabolites in diabetic kidney disease, and develop new tools in network biology to discover novel enzymes, proteins, metabolites, and molecular pathways which are implicated in diabetic kidney disease progression; (iii) test if these models can accurately predict kidney disease progression in independent prospective cohorts. Methods. Using clinical, genetic and metabolomic data from large prospective cohorts of > 1200 diverse, well- characterized patients with Type 2 diabetes, we will apply statistical methods for variable selection (e.g., penalized regression), and machine learning methods (e.g., random forest), which are known to perform well in the high-dimensional setting, to identify robust and parsimonious signatures of kidney disease progression. We will quantify inter-metabolite co-regulation patterns and infer biological pathways implicated in diabetic kidney disease. Throughout the modeling process, a rigorous training-validation paradigm will be adopted in order to improve reproducibility of models and reduce chance findings. Impact. A major product of this work will be the development of a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline. Our findings will also provide insight into markers of renal dysfunction, and elucidate possible therapeutic targets for treating diabetic kidney disease, thus potentially informing the design of future clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney disease, a major and common complication of diabetes, can lead to repeated hospitalizations and premature death. There is an urgent need to develop clinical tools that can provide early evidence that a given diabetic patient is likely to progress to kidney disease in the future. In this proposal, we will identify new urinary biomarkers and use novel statistical modeling methods to create a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline, with the ultimate goal of improving disease management and reducing mortality rates for these patients.",Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease,9923450,R01DK110541,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pima Indian', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Type 2 diabetic', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'bioinformatics tool', 'biological heterogeneity', 'chemical association', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'genetic signature', 'genomic biomarker', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'kidney dysfunction', 'machine learning method', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'model development', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'nephrogenesis', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'predictive test', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'random forest', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,334508,524978793,0.011233691514759796
"Omniview tethered capsule for low cost, non-endoscopic Barrett's esophagus screening in unsedated patients Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is among the most lethal malignancies with a 19% five-year survival rate and its incidence has increased several fold in the last decades. Barrett’s esophagus (BE) confers elevated risk for progression to EAC. Patients diagnosed with BE undergo periodic surveillance endoscopy with biopsies to detect dysplasia which can be treated by endoscopic eradication with radiofrequency ablation before it progresses to EAC. However, the majority of diagnosed EAC patients have not had prior screening endoscopy and present with advanced lesions that limit treatment options and result in poorer survival. The development of a rapid, low cost, well tolerated, non-endoscopic BE screening technique that can be performed in unsedated patients at points of care outside the endoscopy suite would improve BE detection and reduce EAC morbidity and mortality. Our program is a multidisciplinary collaboration among investigators at the Massachusetts Institute Technology and Veteran Affairs Boston Healthcare System / Harvard Medical School that integrates novel optical imaging and software design, preclinical studies in swine, clinical studies in patients, and advanced image processing / machine learning. Aim 1 will develop an omniview tethered capsule technology that generates a map of the esophageal mucosa over a multi-centimeter length of esophagus and a series of wide angle forward views to aid navigation as the capsule is swallowed or retracted. The images will resemble endoscopic white light or narrow band imaging, but will not suffer from perspective distortion present in standard endoscopic or video capsule images. This will facilitate development of automated BE detection algorithms as well as enhance their sensitivity and specificity. This aim will also perform imaging studies in swine as a translational step toward clinical studies. Aim 2 will determine reader sensitivity and specificity for BE detection versus standard endoscopy / biopsy and prepare data for developing automated BE detection. Patients undergoing screening as well as with history of BE undergoing surveillance will be recruited and unsedated capsule imaging will be performed on the same day prior to their endoscopy. Sensitivity and specificity for detecting BE will be assessed using multiple blinded readers and data sets suitable for developing automated BE detection algorithms will be developed. Aim 3 will develop image analysis methods for automated BE detection by investigating classifiers that operate on handcrafted features (colors and textures) and modern deep convolutional neural network methods for direct classification. If successful, this program will develop a rapid, low cost and scalable method for BE screening that would not require patient sedation, endoscopy, or tissue acquisition, and which could be performed in community primary care clinics. The procedure would be much faster and many times lower cost than endoscopy. Automated BE detection would enable immediate results for patient consultation and referral to gastroenterology if indicated. Larger patient populations with expanded risk criteria could be cost effectively screened and access to screening dramatically improved, reducing EAC mortality. Esophageal adenocarcinoma is among the most lethal malignancies with a 19% five-year survival rate and its incidence has increased several fold in the last decades. The program proposes to develop an omniview tethered capsule technology, examination protocol, and automated analysis methods for low cost, rapid, well tolerated, and scalable screening in order to facilitate monitoring and timely treatment. Larger patient populations could be cost effectively screened and access to screening dramatically improved, reducing mortality.","Omniview tethered capsule for low cost, non-endoscopic Barrett's esophagus screening in unsedated patients",10033192,R01CA252216,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Barrett Esophagus', 'Biopsy', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Boston', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dysplasia', 'Endoscopic Biopsy', 'Endoscopy', 'Esophageal Adenocarcinoma', 'Esophageal mucous membrane', 'Esophagus', 'Family suidae', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Label', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Population', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiofrequency Interstitial Ablation', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Referral and Consultation', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Screening Result', 'Sedation procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Side', 'Software Design', 'Stomach', 'Surface', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'advanced disease', 'automated analysis', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'capsule', 'clinical imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'image processing', 'imaging software', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'navigation aid', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'recruit', 'screening']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,336293,113554200,-0.02927525583598584
"Artificial intelligence assisted panoramic Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography for Retinopathy of Prematurity PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term goal of this project is to determine whether optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) might lead more accurate and objective diagnosis, earlier intervention, and improved outcomes in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). International consensus and National Institute of Health (NIH) funded clinical trials over the last 30 years have defined the phenotypic classifications, natural history, prognosis, and management of ROP. However, it is well established that due to the subjectivity of the ophthalmoscopic examination, and systematic bias between examiners, there is significant variation in treatment of the most severe forms of ROP in the real world. This leads to both under-treatment (and poor outcomes due to retinal detachment) and over-treatment (exposing neonates to the ocular and systemic risks of treatment). Roughly 20,000 babies per year develop retinal detachments (RD) due to ROP and there is strong evidence that most of these are preventable. In adult retinal vascular diseases, most notably diabetic retinopathy (DR), OCT and OCTA can detect and quantify disease features such as diabetic macular edema (DME) and retinal neovascularization (NV) before they are noted clinically, enabling earlier treatment and reducing the risk of blindness from RD. However, evaluating the use of this technology in neonates requires high speed and portable technology, and the commercially available handheld OCTs are too slow for ultra-widefield (UWF) OCT and OCTA imaging. Several groups (including our own) have published preliminary results using prototype 100 to 200 kHz swept- source (SS) OCT systems, however consistent data acquisition remains challenging due to the lack of fixation and subsequent motion in an awake neonate, which has limited the evaluation of the potential benefits of the technology in this population. Recently, there has been much interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) (specifically deep learning), which relies on high speed graphics processing units (GPUs) to provide real time OCT image processing, segmentation, and tracking. This application addresses 2 fundamental gaps in knowledge: (1) Can we overcome the technical challenges through the development of a faster ultrawide-field view SS-OCT system coupled with a GPU-enabled DL software system to enable consistent data acquisition in neonates? (2) Would quantitative objective metrics of ROP improve objectivity of ROP diagnosis and detect subclinical signs of disease progression which may enable earlier intervention and improved outcomes in the future. By leveraging our institution’s OCT, AI, and ROP expertise, we will address these questions in three specific aims: (1) Develop an ultra-high speed, handheld, panoramic ultra-widefield OCT/OCTA system. (2) Develop real time GPU accelerated intelligent image acquisition software. (3) Evaluate the clinical significance OCT derived biomarkers. Successful translation of this technology to the ROP population could improve the accuracy and objectivity of ROP diagnosis, and lead to earlier intervention and improved outcomes in patients with severe ROP. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) have proven the ability to detect subclinical disease, provide quantitative evaluation of disease progression, and improve outcomes in the leading causes of blindness in adults, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Technological and practical limitations have limited the application of this technology in routine use for non-sedated children undergoing routine screening for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), the leading cause of blindness in children. The proposed project will develop an ultra-high speed, handheld OCT system with graphics processing unit (GPU) enabled real-time processing to improve the feasibility of panoramic ultra-widefield OCT/OCTA imaging in non-sedated neonates and evaluate the clinical utility of OCT-derived biomarkers in ROP.",Artificial intelligence assisted panoramic Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography for Retinopathy of Prematurity,9943875,R01EY031331,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dyes', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Fluorescein Angiography', 'Funding', 'Fundus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injections', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Natural History', 'Neonatal', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmoscopes', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Retina', 'Retinal Detachment', 'Retinal Neovascularization', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systematic Bias', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visualization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'arm', 'awake', 'base', 'blind', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically significant', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diabetic', 'disease classification', 'disorder of macula of retina', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'instrument', 'interest', 'lens', 'macular edema', 'neonate', 'neovascularization', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'overtreatment', 'parallel computer', 'portability', 'prototype', 'real-time images', 'research clinical testing', 'routine screening', 'sample fixation', 'software systems', 'standard of care', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,341800,304670088,0.012059304019265657
"Assessment of ultrasound features of knee osteoarthritis in a population-based community cohort Project summary Our long-term goal is to demonstrate the utility of ultrasound for OA assessment, standardize its acquisition and scoring, and promote increased uptake of US for use in clinical, research, and trial settings. Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is highly prevalent and frequently debilitating. Development of potential treatments has been hampered by the heterogenous nature of this common chronic condition, which is characterized by a number of subgroups, or phenotypes, with different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Imaging, genetics, biochemical biomarkers, and other features can be used to characterize phenotypes, but variations in data types can make it difficult to harmonize definitions. While radiography is widely used in KOA imaging, it is limited in its ability to assess early disease (when interventions are most likely to succeed) and is insensitive to change. Ultrasound (US) is a widely accessible, time-efficient and cost-effective imaging modality that can provide detailed and reliable information about all joint tissues (e.g., cartilage, meniscus, synovium, bone), and could therefore inform phenotypes in KOA (e.g., by presence of synovitis, effusion, cartilage damage, calcium crystal deposition, and popliteal cysts). Use of US is currently limited by the lack of systematically performed studies in well-characterized non-clinical populations. To address this gap and further the use of this advantageous imaging modality for KOA, we will obtain standardized US and radiography in the population- based Johnston County Health Study (JoCoHS), the new enrollment phase of the 25+ year Johnston County OA Project which includes white, African American, and Hispanic men and women aged 35-70, to achieve three aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the population prevalence (n~3000) of knee US features including cartilage and meniscal damage, synovitis/effusion, calcium crystal deposition, popliteal cysts and osteophytes overall and in key subgroups by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and symptom status. Aim 2 will allow quantification of the associations between these US features and radiographic findings and symptom scores overall and in key subgroups (e.g., those with and without radiographic KOA, by sex, by race/ethnicity). For Aim 3, we will apply novel machine learning methodologies (e.g., Direction-projection-permutation [DiProPerm] hypothesis testing, Joint and Individual Variation [JIVE], and Distance-Weighted Discrimination [DWD]) to a) develop an overall US score for symptomatic KOA and b) identify the contribution of US variables to phenotypes relevant to KOA based on general health, physical activity, and functional assessments. This study is a crucial step to establish the foundation for US as an assessment tool for clinical use, research, and clinical trials in KOA, providing unique population-based cross-sectional data regarding the utility of US and forming the basis for future longitudinal work evaluating its value and performance characteristics related to incident and progressive KOA. Project narrative Osteoarthritis is an enormous and increasing public health problem that, like many other chronic conditions, is not a single disease but a heterogeneous condition consisting of multiple subgroups, or phenotypes, with differing underlying mechanisms. Ultrasound is an accessible, time-efficient, and cost-effective imaging modality that provides invaluable data about all joint tissues involved in osteoarthritis and has the potential to identify important phenotypes. The proposed work is relevant to the NIAMS mission and represents a crucial step to establish the foundation for ultrasound as an assessment tool for use in clinics, research, and clinical trials in osteoarthritis.",Assessment of ultrasound features of knee osteoarthritis in a population-based community cohort,9944803,R01AR077060,"['Address', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Spur', 'Calcium', 'Cartilage', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Claustrophobias', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Assessment Tool', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'County', 'Crystal Formation', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Popliteal Cyst', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Differences', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Synovial Membrane', 'Synovitis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'bone', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'effusion', 'follow-up', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'men', 'novel', 'point of care', 'population based', 'recruit', 'rheumatologist', 'sex', 'uptake']",NIAMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,342100,511185245,0.0012307027243148192
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018 Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network 2018 Renewal ABSTRACT In the past 5 years, the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) has increased cumulative enrollment to over 2000 adult and pediatric patients in the ongoing Prospective and Retrospective registry studies. In addition, an “Acute” DILI protocol with collection of serial early biological samples for mechanistic biomarker studies was developed and implemented. Other network aims included investigation of the role of genetic polymorphisms in DILI susceptibility and outcome, development of improved causality assessment methods, and expansion of the LiverTox website. The University of Michigan team led by Dr. Fontana has played an important role in the design, implementation, and analysis of the primary and ancillary DILIN studies since its inception in 2003. Michigan has not only been a leading enroller in all of the ongoing Registry studies but also provided important leadership in multiple DILIN committees and initiatives. The Michigan team now proposes a series of novel and feasible study aims for the DILIN renewal. The PRIMARY AIM of this proposal is to continue to recruit and enroll high causality adult and pediatric DILI cases into the registry studies for genetic, immunologic, biomarker and mechanistic studies. The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Network has specific plans to increase the enrollment of ethnic minorities via the engagement of hepatologists/ collaborators in southeastern Michigan and elsewhere that care for a large number of African American, Hispanic, and Asian patients. In addition, further development of natural language processing algorithms to search the EMR at the University of Michigan are proposed to facilitate enrollment. Qualitative, quantitative and toxicological studies of the chemical constituents in the herbal and dietary supplement (HDS) products implicated in a growing proportion of DILI cases will be expanded via an ongoing collaboration with the National Center for National Products Research. The SECOND AIM of this proposal is to conduct pilot/ feasibility clinical trials to improve the outcomes of patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI. Proposed study designs include a 12 week course of a simple and safe, orally administered anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidant agent (e.g. budesonide, SAMe, vitamin E) in selected patients with severe acute DILI at risk for adverse outcomes. In addition, 12 to 24 week studies of a safe and effective orally administered anti- cholestatic agent such as an ileal apical bile salt transport inhibitor that may reduce serum bile acids are proposed for subjects at risk of chronic DILI. Lastly, prospective studies of magnetic resonance elastography and MRCP imaging are proposed to improve our understanding of the severity and natural history of DILI. The THIRD AIM of this proposal is to further expand the LiverTox website to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, develop and implement a computerized causality assessment instrument, and assemble working committees to insure that the website content remains up to date and pertinent. Finally, additional collaborations between DILIN and the US FDA and other regulatory agencies are proposed to enhance the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN for new causes of DILI and temporal changes over time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The University of Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the etiologies, risk factors, and outcomes of DILI via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients including targeted enrollment of ethnic minority patients that will help determine if there are racial differences in DILI susceptibility and outcomes via analysis of collected biological samples, DNA, liver tissue, and clinical data. Pilot/ feasibility clinical trials of simple, safe and mechanistically based treatments for patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI are also proposed. Finally, further development and enhancement of the LiverTox website is proposed to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, development and implementation of a computerized diagnostic instrument, and expansion of the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018,9998934,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Antioxidants', 'Apical', 'Asians', 'Assessment tool', 'Bile Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Budesonide', 'Caring', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Chinese People', 'Cholestasis', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic study', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Herbal supplement', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologics', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance Elastography', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Oxidants', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'S-Adenosylmethionine', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'Taiwan', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vitamin E', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'bile salts', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized', 'design', 'ethnic minority population', 'hepatotoxin', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'instrument', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outreach', 'pediatric patients', 'pharmacovigilance', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'racial difference', 'recruit', 'repository', 'sample collection', 'transcriptomics', 'transport inhibitor', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2020,344849,641965656,-0.009234920797844465
"Quantitative MR Imaging of Vascular Factors in Parkinsons Disease Abstract Vascular health has been shown to be an important factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Hence, the ability to measure reliably and quantitatively early hemodynamic changes in the aging brain can be a powerful tool for diagnosing, studying, and developing treatments. Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging can yield quantitative perfusion images without the use of contrast agents. We propose that combining new ASL techniques, such as Velocity Selective Inversion (VSI) labeling pulses and magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) with deep learning regression methods will allow quantification of multiple hemodynamic parameters beyond perfusion, thus providing a much more nuanced picture of the state of the vasculature. We also expect that the new technique will offer dramatic improvements in SNR, specificity and sensitivity of ASL, and that the proposed techniques will have many other applications in research and in the clinic. We propose to use these techniques to fill the knowledge gap regarding the relationship between vascular changes and Parkinson’s disease and its symptoms, particularly fatigue, whose pathogenesis is not well understood. If we are successful in this application, future work will use the hemodynamic parameters of interest as biomarkers to assess risk of neurodegeneration, determine therapeutic targets, and guide in the development of new therapies. Public Health Statement Vascular health is an important factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases We propose to develop a method that can produce quantifiable images of multiple blood flow related parameters with a single scan and without the use of contrast injections. We will use this method to gain a better understanding of the relationship between Parkinson’s disease and cerebral blood flow, and expect that our method will have multiple applications beside Parkinson’s disease.",Quantitative MR Imaging of Vascular Factors in Parkinsons Disease,9968566,R01NS112233,"['Address', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Arteries', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Brain', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Fatigue', 'Fingerprint', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human Volunteers', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Injections', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Noise', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Spin Labels', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'aging brain', 'deep learning', 'feeding', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging biomarker', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural network', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'perfusion imaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'vascular factor', 'vector', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,348762,641965656,-0.016010039619457905
"Clinical feasibility of a non-invasive, low-cost wearable for measuring air trapping in COPD ABSTRACT  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of hospitalization in the US. Exacerbations - a worsening or “flare up” of symptoms - cause most COPD hospitalizations. Since most exacerbations can be treated with changes of inhalers and/or oral medications, at-home detection of lung function deterioration may facilitate earlier intervention and help delay or prevent hospitalizations. The Standards of Care for monitoring lung function are spirometry, plethysmography, and CT scan. However, these are expensive methods and unsuited for continuous monitoring or at-home use. Various patient self-monitoring approaches have been tried, for example, pulse oximetry, respiratory rate monitoring, and peak flow metering, but their efficacy in reducing hospitalizations has been limited.  A common finding for all forms of COPD is air trapping, defined, as an abnormal increase in the volume of air remaining in the lungs after exhalation is complete. A body of evidence definitively shows that air trapping increases during exacerbations and decreases when exacerbations resolve. Recent reports show that air trapping is an earlier harbinger of deteriorating lung function than spirometric changes, and can be measured by low-frequency ultrasound (1-40 kHz). Acoustic monitoring of air trapping could provide clinicians with a non- invasive tool when medical intervention is needed to avoid unnecessary ER visits and hospitalizations.  Respira Labs has developed a low-cost, non-invasive, acoustic-based wearable device that can continually monitor lung resonance: Sylvee. The device uses known acoustic-based technology with machine- learning algorithms to detect minor changes in lung resonance, which our preliminary results suggest correspond to changes in air trapping. The overall objective of this project is to validate Sylvee's air trapping algorithms in a cohort of 20 healthy controls and 40 COPD patients with and without air trapping, respectively. In Aims 1 and 2, we will miniaturize and add sensors to the Sylvee device and develop a user interface (UI) and a mobile application. In Aims 3 and 4, we will create an Air Trapping Index Report and validate it in a cross-sectional study vis-à-vis whole body plethysmography as a control. Results of this project provide a go/no-go development decision based on device function. We can apply these results in STTR Phase II, in a larger clinical study to evaluate Sylvee as an at-home monitoring system, with a goal of reducing hospitalizations by at least 30%. Ultimately, Sylvee will allow physicians to remotely monitor their patients' lung function and adjust their medications to reduce healthcare costs and improve patients' quality of life. PROJECT NARRATIVE More than 12 million Americans have been diagnosed with COPD, and another 17 million may have COPD, but are unaware of it. By 2020, the costs associated with COPD are estimated to be $72B billion per year, of which with ~50% are the costs of spent on ER visits and hospitalizations. The goal of this proposal is to establish and validate a seamless and non-obtrusive wearable that measures abnormal air trapping via a novel acoustic technology, which would reduce hospitalizations through at-home monitoring of lung function.","Clinical feasibility of a non-invasive, low-cost wearable for measuring air trapping in COPD",10080272,R41HL152769,"['Acoustics', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Asthma', 'Bluetooth', 'Bronchoconstriction', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic Bronchitis', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Dyspnea', 'Early Intervention', 'Edema', 'Emergency department visit', 'Exhalation', 'Exposure to', 'Flare', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Humidity', 'Individual', 'Inhalators', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Miniaturization', 'Minor', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucous body substance', 'Noise', 'Oral', 'Oxygen saturation measurement', 'Particulate', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Plethysmography', 'Population', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Refractory', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporting', 'Respiratory Muscles', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Running', 'San Francisco', 'Secure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'Veterans', 'Whole Body Plethysmography', 'Wireless Technology', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'air monitoring', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meter', 'microphone', 'miniaturize', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'novel', 'ozone exposure', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'sensor', 'smartphone Application', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'wearable device']",NHLBI,"RESPIRA LABS, LLC",R41,2020,350000,350000,-0.019973341099215055
"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning. Success of the project will overcome the major technical hurdles in the use of MRI in radiation therapy and will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information.

"Biomarker Discovery for Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Children Project Abstract Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the aggressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, the most common liver disease in children in the United States. The disease affects almost 1/3 of all obese children, estimated to be approximately 7 million children. Treatment is based on lifestyle changes such as a low sugar diet and increasing exercise, but no therapeutics are approved for children or adults. Currently, diagnosis of NASH requires a liver biopsy, which is cumbersome, expensive and has inherent risk. The lack of 1) non-invasive biomarkers to diagnose NASH and 2) pharmacodynamic/response biomarkers of NASH to therapy are considered by many to be an important barrier in the field. These biomarkers are needed to advance clinical care, focusing resources on the children with the most progressive form of the disease. And they are needed to drive therapeutic development because children with NASH are prioritized for participation in clinical trials and response biomarkers for NASH are needed to become surrogate endpoint biomarkers for clinical trials to accelerate drug development. This proposal represents an exceptional multidisciplinary effort to address these important gaps in knowledge. The project will be led by Dr. Miriam Vos, expert in pediatric NAFLD and experienced in early biomarker development research. Co-investigators including Dr. Kristal Maner-Smith, expert in lipidomics and Dr. Ayman Akil, expert in machine learning and biomarker discovery. The team seeks to develop a panel of biomarkers to predict NASH and to reflect response of NASH to therapy through the 2 following aims. Aim 1 will define and validate a panel of metabolites and lipids diagnostic of NASH in children. Aim 2 will define and validate a panel of metabolites, lipids and clinical variables that are associated with treatment induced improvement in NASH. Aims 1 and 2 will both capitalize on the exceptionally high-quality samples available from the NASH clinical research network and deposited within the NIDDK Central Repository. Repository serum samples are available from two pediatric clinical studies including the NAFLD Database study and the TONIC randomized clinical trial and were collected near in time to a liver biopsy as well as with detailed clinical phenotyping. Validation cohort and control samples will be drawn from the Emory Liver Biopsy Biorepository study and an ongoing Healthy Control pediatric cohort at Emory. Preliminary data demonstrates strong associations between specific metabolites and pathologic features of NASH including hepatocyte ballooning, inflammation and steatosis supporting feasibility. These studies are designed to have a sustained, powerful impact on the pediatric NASH biomarker field and to directly improve the health of children through efficient diagnosis of NASH and successful therapeutic development for NASH. Project Narrative This proposal seeks to improve child health through detecting and validating novel biomarkers for pediatric nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, the more progressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

"Center for Machine Learning in Urology PROJECT SUMMARY We propose to establish an Exploratory Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Benign Urology at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), the central mission of which is to apply machine learning to improve the understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, risk stratification, and prediction of treatment responses of benign urological disease among children and adults. The proposed CHOP/Penn Center for Machine Learning in Urology (CMLU) addresses critical structural and scientific barriers that impede the development of new treatments and the effective application of existing treatments for benign urologic disease across the lifespan. Structurally, urologic research occurs in silos, with little interaction among investigators that study different diseases or different populations (e.g. pediatric and adult). Scientifically, analysis of imaging and other types complex data is limited by inter-observer variability, and incomplete utilization of available information. This proposal overcomes these barriers by applying cutting-edge approaches in machine learning to analyze CT images that are routinely obtained for evaluation of individuals with kidney stone disease. Central to the CHOP/Penn CMLU is the partnership of urologists and experts in machine learning, which will bring a new approach to generating knowledge that advances research and clinical care. In addition, the CMLU will expand the urologic research community by providing a research platform and standalone machine learning executables that could be applied to other datasets. The Center’s mission will be achieved through the following Aims, with progress assessed through systematic evaluation: Aim 1. To expand the research base investigating benign urological disease. We will establish a community with the research base, particularly with the KURe, UroEpi programs, other P20 Centers, and O’Brien Centers. We will build this community by providing mini-coaching clinics to facilitate application of machine learning to individual projects, developing an educational hub for synchronous and asynchronous engagement with the research base, and making freely available all source codes and standalone executables for all machine learning tools. Aim 2. To improve prediction of ureteral stone passage using machine learning of CT images. The CMLU has developed deep learning methods that segment and automate measurement of urinary stones and adjacent renal anatomy. In the Research Project, we will compare these methods to existing segmentation methods and the current gold standard of manual measurement. We will then extract informative features from thousands of CT scans to predict the probability of spontaneous passage of ureteral stones for children and adults evaluated in the CHOP and Penn healthcare systems. Aim 3. To foster collaboration in benign urological disease research across levels of training and centers through an Educational Enrichment Program. We will amplify interactions across institutions and engage investigators locally and nationally by providing summer research internships, and interinstitutional exchange program, and an annual research symposium. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed CHOP/Penn O’Brien Center for Machine Learning in Urology addresses critical structural and scientific barriers that impede development of new treatments and the effective application of existing treatments for benign urologic disease across the lifespan. This application overcomes these barriers by applying cutting- edge approaches in machine learning to analyze complex imaging data for individuals with kidney stone disease.The Center’s strategic vision of using machine learning to generate knowledge that improves diagnosis, risk stratification strategies, and prediction of outcomes among children and adults will be achieved through the implementation of a Educational Enrichment Program and a Research Project.",Center for Machine Learning in Urology,10133362,P20DK127488,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Status', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internships', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pennsylvania', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk stratification', 'Site', 'Source Code', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urologist', 'Urology', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical care', 'complex data ', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'human error', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'peer', 'programs', 'routine imaging', 'senior faculty', 'skills', 'summer research', 'symposium', 'tool', 'urologic', 'web page']",NIDDK,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,P20,2020,358890,178185562,-0.0018246376041160311
"Differential artery-vein analysis in OCT angiography for objective classification of diabetic retinopathy Abstract: This project aims to establish differential artery-vein analysis in optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), and to validate comprehensive OCTA features for automated classification of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Early detection, prompt intervention, and reliable assessment of treatment outcomes are essential to prevent irreversible visual loss from DR. It is known that DR can target arteries and veins differently. Therefore, differential artery-vein analysis can provide better performance of DR detection and classification. However, clinical OCTA instruments lack the capability of artery-vein differentiation. During this project, we propose to use quantitative feature analysis of OCT, which is concurrently captured with OCTA, to guide artery- vein differentiation in OCTA. The first aim is to establish automated artery-vein differentiation in OCTA. In coordination with our recently demonstrated blood vessel tracking technique, OCT intensity/geometry features will be used to guide artery-vein differentiation in OCTA automatically. Differential artery-vein analysis of blood vessel tortuosity (BVT), blood vessel caliber (BVC), blood vessel density (BVD), vessel perimeter index (VPI), vessel branching coefficient (VBC), vessel branching angle (VBA), branching width ratio (BWR), fovea avascular zone area (FAZ-A) and FAZ contour irregularity (FAZ-CI) will be implemented. Key success criterion of the aim 1 study is to demonstrate robust artery-vein differentiation in OCTA, and to establish OCTA features for objective detection and classification of DR. The second aim is to validate automated OCTA classification of DR. We propose to employ ensemble machine learning to integrate multiple classifiers to achieve robust OCTA classification of DR. Key success criterion of the aim 2 study is to identify OCTA features and optimal-feature- combination to detect early DR, and to establish the correlations between the OCTA features and clinical biomarkers. The third aim is to verify OCTA prediction and evaluation of DR treatment. Our preliminary OCTA study of diabetic macular edema (DME) with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment has shown that BVD can serve as a biomarker predictive of visual improvement. During this project, we plan to test differential artery-vein analysis for DME treatment evaluation. Key success criterion of the aim 3 study is to identify artery-vein features to provide robust prediction and evaluation of DME treatment outcomes. As an alternative approach, we propose a fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) for deep machine leaning based artery-vein and DR classification. Early layers in the FCNN will produce simple features, which will be convolved and filtered into deeper layers to produce complex features for artery-vein and DR classification. Further investigation of the relationship between the new features learned through the machine learning process and clinical biomarkers will allow us to optimize the design for better DR classification. Success of this project will pave the way towards using quantitative OCTA features for early DR detection, objective prediction and assessment of treatment outcomes. Project Narrative This project is to establish quantitative optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) analysis for objective classification of diabetic retinopathy (DR). By translating subjective findings into objective assessments, this study will standardize clinical OCTA for eye disease detection and treatment assessment. In addition, objective OCTA analysis based automated DR classification can foster telemedicine in rural and underserved areas where the access to experienced ophthalmologists is limited.",Differential artery-vein analysis in OCT angiography for objective classification of diabetic retinopathy,9857745,R01EY030842,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Caliber', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Exudate', 'Eye diseases', 'Fostering', 'Fundus photography', 'Geometry', 'Health Expenditures', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microaneurysm', 'Modernization', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Reflex action', 'Retina', 'Retinal Edemas', 'Retinal Hemorrhage', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Veins', 'Venous', 'Visual', 'Width', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'clinical biomarkers', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'experience', 'fovea centralis', 'fundus imaging', 'global health', 'image registration', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'macular edema', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'rural underserved', 'success', 'support vector machine', 'vascular abnormality']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,362544,148463823,0.007120375359337277
"A Novel Informatics System for Craniosynostosis Surgery Project Summary CranioSynOstosis (CSO) is the premature fusion of one or more of cranial sutures that connect individual skull bones for kids. The estimated prevalence of CSO is one in 2500 live births and even higher. Our ultimate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS). CSO is an extremely serious birth defect that involves the premature fusion, of one or more sutures on a baby's skull. CSO, in terms of the fused suture, could be classified mainly into several types of synostosis, such as sagittal, coronal, metopic, and lambdoid. Infants with CSO may have problems with brain and skull growth, resulting in cognitive impairment. This defect may not only ruin the infant's life, but also deeply affect the infant's family. SAS, recognized as a safe, effective, and less invasive treatment method, introduced to treat the CSO. This treatment uses the force of a spring to reshape the skull in a slower manner that harnesses the growth of the skull to assist with shape change. Patient-specific spring selection is the principal barrier to the advancement of SAS for CSO because few surgeons have the experience to select personalized springs for each patient. The selection of the spring force is a crucial step in this surgical treatment, and it is dependent on the experience of the surgeon. Important factors essential in the selection of the spring force include the ages, bone thickness and the subtypes of CSO. One example is that sagittal CSO with an elongated occiput needs a stronger posterior spring, while one with no predominant characteristics typically needs a mid-range anterior and posterior spring. The current problem is that we do not have a complete objective way of classification of CSO and sagittal CSO and estimation of the spring force for the individual. Our hypothesis is that CSO and sagittal CSO can be accurately classified based on the features from sutures and head shape, and behaviors of calvarial bone tissue following virtual optimal spring force can be accurately simulated by integrating a finite element method (FEM) with statistical learning model. To test our hypothesis, we are proposing the following Specific Aim: (1) To define the eSuture Informatic system and build the database, with CT and DTI data; (2) To develop tools for image processing, segmentation, registration, quantification of sutures, and automatically categorize each patient to one catalogue of the CSO types or sagittal CSO subtype; (3) To model and estimate the optimal spring force for SAS; and (4) To validate and evaluate the eSuture system. Our system will produce a paradigm shift in CSO diagnosis and treatment. Narrative Our immediate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis (CSO) using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS).

"Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT Keratoconus is a degenerative disease of the cornea that is a major cause of reduced vision-related quality of life in the United States, often leading to corneal transplantation. Ectasia after refractive surgery is a vision-threatening complication that can occur in apparently low-risk patients despite current screening technology. The biomechanical properties of the cornea play a central role in these diseases, but diagnostics are still rooted in shape measures because doctors lack direct measures of biomechanical change. While several methods have shown early promise for addressing this gap, most require contact with or perturbation of the cornea, cannot spatially resolve biomechanical properties, or involve expensive optical systems.  To address the need for direct biomechanical measurement of the cornea and the limitations of other approaches, we introduce phase-decorrelation OCT (phd-OCT). Phd-OCT makes use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to quantify random nanoscale mobility that is related to the strength and cohesion of the cornea. Preliminary results strongly support the rationale, feasibility and potential advantages of the approach. Our objectives are: (1) to refine our method to optimize detection sensitivity and speed, and (2) to determine if the technique is clinically useful. We will achieve these objectives through the following aims: 1. To develop and validate mobility-sensitive phd-OCT for corneal imaging. Spectral-domain OCT will be used for anterior segment phase-decorrelation imaging and the analysis algorithm will be optimized. The system will be validated using phantoms and torsional rheometry. 2. To investigate the potential influence of physiological factors (intraocular pressure (IOP), hydration, and temperature). Factorial design experiments in porcine and human donor globes will establish the sensitivity of phd-OCT measurements to potential confounders. 3. To develop and validate data acquisition and processing methods to enable clinical testing. GPU processing and machine learning will be configured to minimize processing time. Scan patterns will be optimized to minimize scan time and return clinically useful data. 4. To assess feasibility and preliminary diagnostic performance of clinical mobility-sensitive OCT imaging of the cornea. A first-in-human study will characterize repeatability and test the hypotheses that phd-OCT mobility measurements are increased in the region of a LASIK flap and decreased in CXL.  Expected Outcomes: The proposed studies will establish a new, non-contact method for imaging corneal biomechanical properties with the potential to address many shortcomings of current and emerging methods. Success could lead to earlier detection of of ectasia risk and allow more appropriate timing and customization of corneal treatments. Future integration of data into computational models has the potential to greatly impact the field by driving a shift from empirical planning and risk analysis to patient-specific strategies. The mechanical properties of the cornea, the transparent front of the eye, are important for diseases that affect vision as well as for corrective treatments like crosslinking therapy and LASIK. We have developed a new optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based method to detect and map corneal mechanical properties that has advantages that may make it readily translatable to clinical use. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether this technique is clinically feasible and useful by refining the technology, testing it in animal and human donor corneas, and performing studies in patients with corneal conditions of interest.",Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT,9942461,R01EY028667,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Laser In Situ Keratomileusis', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'computerized data processing', 'crosslink', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'mechanical properties', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NEI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,391938,197030888,-0.003001954813098228
"Distributed Learning of Deep Learning Models for Cancer Research Project Summary Deep learning methods are showing great promise for advancing cancer research and could potentially improve clinical decision making in cancers such as primary brain glioma, where deep learning models have recently shown promising results in predicting isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation and survival in these patients. A major challenge thwarting this research, however, is the requirement for large quantities of labeled image data to train deep learning models. Efforts to create large public centralized collections of image data are hindered by barriers to data sharing, costs of image de-identification, patient privacy concerns, and control over how data are used. Current deep learning models that are being built using data from one or a few institutions are limited by potential overfitting and poor generalizability. Instead of centralizing or sharing patient images, we aim to distribute the training of deep learning models across institutions with computations performed on their local image data. Although our preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, there are three key challenges to translating these methods into research practice: (1) data is heterogeneous among institutions in the amount and quality of data that could impair the distributed computations, (2) there are data security and privacy concerns, and (3) there are no software packages that implement distributed deep learning with medical images. We tackle these challenges by (1) optimizing and expanding our current methods of distributed deep learning to tackle challenges of data variability and data privacy/security, (2) creating a freely available software system for building deep learning models on multi- institutional data using distributed computation, and (3) evaluating our system to tackle deep learning problems in example use cases of classification and clinical prediction in primary brain cancer. Our approach is innovative in developing distributed deep learning methods that will address variations in data among different institutions, that protect patient privacy during distributed computations, and that enable sites to discover pertinent datasets and participate in creating deep learning models. Our work will be significant and impactful by overcoming critical hurdles that researchers face in tapping into multi-institutional patient data to create deep learning models on large collections of image data that are more representative of disease than data acquired from a single institution, while avoiding the hurdles to inter-institutional sharing of patient data. Ultimately, our methods will enable researchers to collaboratively develop more generalizable deep learning applications to advance cancer care by unlocking access to and leveraging huge amounts of multi-institutional image data. Although our clinical use case in developing this technology is primary brain cancer, our methods will generalize to all cancers, as well as to other types of data besides images for use in creating deep learning models, and will ultimately lead to robust deep learning applications that are expected to improve clinical care and outcomes in many types of cancer. Project Narrative We develop technology that will enable researchers to tap into the enormous amount of imaging data in multiple institutions to create deep learning models for cancer applications without requiring sharing of patient data. Our work will thus enable development of more robust deep learning models to improve clinical decision making in cancer than models currently built on data from single institutions. Although our focus is improving decision making in the primary brain cancer, our methods and tools are generalizable and will be broadly applicable to all cancers, with the potential for improvement in clinical care and patient health.",Distributed Learning of Deep Learning Models for Cancer Research,10018827,U01CA242879,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Brain', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Glioma', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Information Networks', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Privacy', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer type', 'care outcomes', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data privacy', 'data quality', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'learning strategy', 'molecular marker', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient privacy', 'radiologist', 'research to practice', 'software systems', 'survival prediction', 'tool']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,394824,560644462,-0.021071173758924616
"Wearable lung sounds, fluid, and body temperature monitoring for patients with COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic has tremendously impacted society, communities, and the healthcare system across the world, and threatens to continue to challenge society for the coming months and years. More than 1 million Americans have been diagnosed with COVID-19, and more than 60,000 Americans have lost their lives as of the writing of this proposal. The ultimate goal of this research is to create a wearable physiological sensing solution for COVID-19 patient management, including diagnosis, triage, and monitoring of patients based on lung sounds, lung fluid, body temperature, and inertial measures captured with the same device. The central innovation lies in the hardware and algorithms that have been proposed for this purpose, building upon the team’s prior work in other areas of wearable bio-acoustic sensing and bioimpedance spectroscopy. The following two specific aims are proposed for the research: (1) to design, implement, and validate a wearable sensing system for lung sounds, lung fluid, body temperature, and inertial measurements; and (2) to test and evaluate this system to assess efficacy and potential information derived in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and persons under investigation for COVID-19 longitudinally. Successful completion of this project would result in a validated prototype for sensing multiple parameters of cardiopulmonary health in patients with COVID-19, with imminent feasibility to transition the technology to commercialization and through regulatory pathways. This would provide a much-needed patient management technology for this novel coronavirus to healthcare practitioners and ultimately a means to monitor patients remotely to ensure that any deterioration in health is detected as early as possible. The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has affected the US and the rest of the world in an unparalleled manner, taking nearly 60,000 lives in the US alone over the past two months and afflicting more than a million Americans, with costs to society that are difficult to measure or bear. Technologies for improving the management of patients presenting at the emergency room are urgently needed in this era, specifically for determining whether such patients should be cared for in the intensive care unit, via infectious diseases procedures, or otherwise. We propose to design a wearable system for measuring lung sounds, lung fluid, body temperature, and movement in the same device to address these critical needs.","Wearable lung sounds, fluid, and body temperature monitoring for patients with COVID-19",10163297,R01EB023808,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Auscultation', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Body Temperature', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Childhood Arthritis', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Community Healthcare', 'Data Analytics', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Electronics', 'Emergency Medical Technicians', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Injuries', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Output', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respiratory Sounds', 'Respiratory distress', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Skin Temperature', 'Societies', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stethoscopes', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Triage', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'healthy volunteer', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'miniaturize', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel coronavirus', 'pandemic disease', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'synergism', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIBIB,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,396542,45341731,-0.030987066907088672
"SBIR Phase I - Topic 402 -  Artificial Intelligence-Aided Imaging for Cancer Prevention, Diagnosis, and Monitoring Retinoblastoma is a rare pediatric cancer affecting the retina, optic nerve, and brain. Accounting for 6% of all cancers in children under the age of five, it is the world's most common primary intraocular childhood malignancy. While survival rates in the U.S. are high, early detection is pivotal to preserving vision: by the time symptoms present, enucleation is often the only option. This proposal seeks to develop IRIS-R, an Intelligent Retinal Imaging Solution to enable earlier detection of Retinoblastoma.

"SBIR Phase I Topic 402: Artificial Intelligence-Aided Imaging for Cancer Prevention, Diagnosis, and Monitoring Image-based evaluation of lymph nodes is an essential step in cancer diagnosis, treatment and monitoring. Current clinical practice mostly uses qualitative or semi-quantitative measures in evaluation and thus suffers from inaccuracy due to intra- and inter-observer variability and increased human efforts. This becomes a more serious issue in head and neck cancers due to the large number of clinically relevant lymph nodes. In this project an AI-based automatic segmentation software will be developed for quantitative cervical lymph node evaluation to increase the accuracy and reduce the cost. However, there are a few challenges in developing and deploying such a software due to different clinical practices such as usage of different modalities (MRI and/or CT) and complex clinical workflow. To address these challenges, a novel AI algorithm that can handle the variability in imaging modalities and support incremental learning using site-specific data to enhance its robustness will be developed; a private-cloud-based software framework with high usability will then be developed to incorporate this algorithm and provide advanced visualization and reporting for clinical usage. This software will have high impact on all stages of patient care for head and neck cancers and can be further extended to other cancers. n/a","SBIR Phase I Topic 402: Artificial Intelligence-Aided Imaging for Cancer Prevention, Diagnosis, and Monitoring",10269836,5N91020C00048,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cervical lymph node group', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Image', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Reporting', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Framework', 'Visualization', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer prevention', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'imaging modality', 'lymph nodes', 'novel', 'segmentation algorithm', 'usability']",NCI,"CARINA MEDICAL, LLC",N43,2020,400000,1400000,-0.01742340669102672
"SBIR Phase I Topic 402 -  Artificial Intelligence-Aided Imaging for Cancer Prevention, Diagnosis, and Monitoring This project aims to develop an interpretable, physician-in-the-loop AI-aided software that accurately delineates glioma boundaries in MRIs, computes volumetric curves, and statistically quantifies the tumor growth in longitudinal studies. The current clinical practice of visually analyzing and manually contouring tumors is subjective, time-consuming, and often inconsistent. The novelty of MRIMath's explainable, trustworthy, and physician-in-the-loop AI system is multi-fold. First, we introduce a multi-scale feature extraction framework using the inception modules in contracting and expanding paths of the U-Net image segmentation neural network architecture. Second, we propose a new loss function based on the modified Dice similarity coefficient. Third, we train and test the AI system using two learning regimes: learning to segment intra-tumoral structures and learning to segment glioma sub-regions. Finally, we produce heat maps to visualize the features extracted by the AI, thus offering physicians a view of AI's attention patterns and activation maps that were triggered during AI's decision-making. An intuitive and interactive User Interface will allow the physician to review contouring results, make adjustments and approve contours, visualize AI's explanations and volumetric measurements, and finally review the results of the statistical analysis.

"Exploring the role of gonadotropins in Down syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Down syndrome (DS) is a common chromosomal disorder that results from the triplication of chromosome 21. Comorbid medical conditions frequently occur among individuals with DS; however, opthalamic disorders such as keratoconus occurs 6 times more often among this population as compared to the general population. Keratoconus is a known multifactorial, progressive, degenerative disease of the cornea; however, the etiology of the disease remains unclear. Our recent work has found that hormone-regulated Prolactin-Induced Protein (PIP) is a potential biomarker of keratoconus but the link between DS and keratoconus remains unclear. Pathway analysis has further linked comorbid DS and keratoconus through gonadotropins and serum amyloid A1 (SAA), a protein linked in a series of studies to cognitive dysfunction among adults with DS. The proposed study aims to determine and validate the role of gonadotropins in the DS population with the keratoconus co-morbidity with the long-term goal to better understand the underlying mechanisms that result in increased risk for ocular co-morbidities such as keratoconus among this population. This pilot study will include n=90 participants (n=30 DS; n=30 comorbid DS and Keratoconus; n=30 healthy controls). All participants will provide biofluid samples of tears and plasma, which will be assayed on an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) platform. Analyses will be performed using R and SPSS 24 (IBM) in a series of steps. Support Vector Machine (SVM) analyses will be applied to examine the use of biomarkers to detect disease presence (i.e. keratoconus comorbidity). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analyses will help with variable selection in order to enhance the prediction accuracy of the models. Biomarkers will include hormone specific (LSH, LH, GNRH, LHR, FSHR, GNRHR) as well as a panel of plasma proteins including biomarkers of inflammation linked with cognitive dysfunction (SAA, CRP, ICAM1, VCAM1, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, IL-5, IL-7, Eotaxin-3, TARC, A2M, B2M, FVII, TNC, Adiponectin, FABP-3, IL-18, PPY, TPO and I-309). Diagnosis of keratoconus will be utilized as the dependent variable. If successful, data obtained from this study could help facility the development of a screening tool for detecting individuals with DS who are at risk for development of keratoconus, with the goal of defining potential enrollment into clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Vision disorders occur in nearly all individuals with Down syndrome (DS) with development of ocular co-morbidities such as keratoconus, a cornea dystrophy, occurring 6 times more often in this population as compared to the general population. Recent work from our group has found differences in sex hormones (i.e. androgen and estrogen levels) among individuals with keratoconus as compared to healthy controls but this difference was impacted by age and gender. Information gained from this study will (1) reveal the relationship between gonadotropins among individuals with DS and ocular comorbidities, specifically keratoconus, and (2) provide insight into the association between known plasma biomarkers including serum amyloid A1 and gonadotrophins among those with DS as well as those with comorbid keratoconus and DS.",Exploring the role of gonadotropins in Down syndrome,10108508,R21EY032320,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Androgens', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blepharitis', 'Blood', 'CCL1 gene', 'CCL17 gene', 'CCL26 gene', 'Cataract', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosome 21', 'Clinical Trials', 'Congenital chromosomal disease', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Corneal dystrophy', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Down Syndrome', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Estrogens', 'Etiology', 'Eye Development', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone', 'Future', 'GNRH1 gene', 'GNRH2 gene', 'GNRHR gene', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Gonadal Hormones', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Gonadotropins', 'Health', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'ICAM1 gene', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interleukin-10', 'Interleukin-18', 'Interleukin-5', 'Interleukin-6', 'Interleukin-7', 'Keratoconus', 'Lacrimal Duct Obstruction', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Luteinizing Hormone', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic Nystagmus', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Play', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prolactin', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Readiness', 'Refractive Errors', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Strabismus', 'TNF gene', 'Thinness', 'Thyroid Hormones', 'Time', 'Vision Disorders', 'Visual Acuity', 'Weight', 'Work', 'adiponectin', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'insight', 'link protein', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'novel', 'potential biomarker', 'programs', 'receptor', 'sex', 'support vector machine']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR,R21,2020,403584,31777928,-0.019206537913171666
"Sleep Health Profiles in Middle-aged Workers in Relation to Cardiovascular and Cognitive Health Middle-aged workers are vulnerable to having poor sleep, which is a public concern as it may lead to decreased productivity at work and increased risks of health problems over time. Most studies have associated one aspect of sleep (often focusing on sleep duration) with work or health-related variables, lacking a comprehensive understanding of how the combinations of multiple dimensions of sleep within individuals are associated with work-related stress and health outcomes. For example, a combination of sufficient sleep duration, regular sleep/wake, efficient sleep, and no insomnia symptom may be more predictive of concurrent and later cardiovascular and cognitive health than sleep duration alone. We propose to use multidimensional sleep health profiles that measure “which” and “how many” sleep problems co-occur within individuals. Harmonizing two independent project data sets from the Midlife in the United States Study (MIDUS) and Work, Family & Health Study (WFHS), the proposed study aims at examining the relationships between work-to-nonwork conflict (work stress carried over to and interfering with family and personal activities including sleep), sleep health profiles, and cardiovascular and cognitive health. Aim 1 will identify sleep health profiles in middle-aged workers and examine the associations of work-to-nonwork conflict with the sleep health profiles. Using extensive measures of self- reported and actigraphy-measured sleep, we will identify a priori-defined and empirically-derived sleep health profiles in diverse forms and will evaluate reproducibility of sleep health profiles across MIDUS and WFHS samples. Aim 2 will examine the associations of the sleep health profiles with cardiovascular health outcomes. Taking advantage of two cohorts in MIDUS that were sampled before and after the U.S. Great Recession period (2007-2009), we will also examine the health impacts of a macro- level stressor, whether those who were exposed to the economic recession exhibit a stronger link between sleep health profiles and cardiovascular outcomes than a propensity-matched sample who were not exposed to the recession but otherwise equal on all observables. Aim 3 will further examine the associations of the sleep health profiles with cognitive outcomes, leveraging MIDUS longitudinal cognitive data that include objectively measured episodic memory and executive functioning. We will also explore (1) whether sleep health profiles mediate the relationships between work-related stress (work-to-nonwork conflict) and cardiovascular and cognitive health, (2) potential moderation by sex and race, and (3) daily characteristics that predict optimal sleep health nights (using machine-learning). The proposed sleep health profiles can be broadly used to improve prediction accuracy in health screening tools. Focusing on middle-aged workers will contribute to decreasing health disparities in the workforce and promoting work productivity and healthy aging. Findings will inform the development of sleep-focused interventions to improve sleep and health among middle-aged workers who are in greater need. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of sleep health profiles among U.S. middle-aged workers is expected to increase understanding of how the combinations of multiple sleep characteristics relate to work-related stress and cardiovascular and cognitive health. The identified sleep health profile can be broadly used to improve prediction accuracy in health screening tools and can provide a basis for developing population-level sleep health interventions.

"Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy There are 65 million people worldwide with epilepsy and 150,000 new cases of epilepsy are diagnosed in the US annually. However, treatment options for epilepsy remain inadequate, with many patients suffering from treatment-resistant seizures, cognitive comorbidities and the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to progress towards the development of new therapies is the fact that preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). Recently, the Datta lab showed that complex animal behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules (“syllables”) at sub-second timescales and arranged according to specific rules (“grammar”). These syllables can be detected without observer bias using a method called motion sequencing (MoSeq) that employs video imaging with a 3D camera combined with artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted video analysis to characterize behavior. Through collaboration between the Soltesz and Datta labs, exciting data were obtained that demonstrated that MoSeq can be adapted for epilepsy research to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in a mouse model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. Here we propose to test and improve MoSeq further to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in epilepsy research. This includes the development of an objective alternative to the Racine scale, testing of MoSeq as an automated anti-epileptic drug (AED) screening method, and the development of human observer- independent behavioral biomarkers for seizures, epileptogenesis, and cognitive comorbidities. In addition, we plan to dramatically extend the epilepsy-related capabilities of MoSeq to include the automated tracking of finer-scale body parts (e.g., forelimb and facial clonus) that are not possible with the current approach. Finally, we propose to develop the analysis pipeline for MoSeq into a form that is intuitive, inexpensive, user-friendly and thus easily sharable with the research community. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user- independent, inexpensive analysis of both acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will develop breakthrough technologies involving artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of mouse behavior to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in preclinical epilepsy research. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to have a significant and sustained impact on epilepsy research by enabling investigators to perform objective, automated, inexpensive, reproducible assessment of epilepsy in experimental animals to aid the testing of anti-seizure drugs and other novel therapies.",Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy,10024094,R01NS114020,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Body part', 'Cannabidiol', 'Carbamazepine', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clonazepam', 'Clonus', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Screening', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Face', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Observer Variation', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phenytoin', 'Pilocarpine', 'Probability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Specificity', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'Valproic Acid', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'comorbidity', 'drug use screening', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kainate', 'method development', 'mouse model', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'selective expression', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,422740,560644462,-0.0019019593611460264
"Clinical Evaluation of Burns using Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Durkin, Anthony J. Abstract The central aim of this 3 year competing R01 renewal is to characterize and apply a new, compact, clinic- friendly Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging (SFDI) device to objectively and non-invasively classify burn severity (burn grade) over a large areas of skin. Delays in determining burn severity directly impacts patient treatment plans (including decisions whether to graft), rates of infection and scarring, duration of hospitalization and ultimately cost of care. Currently, the primary method of determining burn severity continues to be clinical assessment, which is highly subjective. While both superficial thickness and full-thickness burns are typically readily diagnosed based on visual clinical impression, partial thickness burns are difficult to classify and carry with them considerable potential for complications. Burn severity classification accuracy, even by experts, is only 60–80%. Our research in animal models demonstrates that SFDI data can successfully be used to classify different regions of burn severities. Typically, these differences are not apparent to the unaided eye and a great deal of training and experience is required in order for clinicians to accurately differentiate them Our work using a research grade, hybrid-SFDI device suggests that objective parameters provided by SFDI can be used within 24 hours after injury, to accurately classify burn severity. Specifically, we have demonstrated in a porcine burn model that the research grade SFDI outperforms laser speckle imaging and thermal imaging at 24 hours post-burn, in terms of predicting whether a burn will require a graft or not. However, translating these results to the clinic has been difficult due to several device limitations. The research grade SFDI device has slow acquisition times that can result in motion artifacts. It is also sensitive to ambient light which is often an issue in a clinical setting. Additionally, the SFDI device generates so much diverse data (oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, water fraction, reduced scattering coefficients at multiple wavelengths), there is no obvious way to present it to a clinical user to make a quick decision. To this end, we propose to methodically investigate an improved next generation SFDI device that addresses these issues by using brighter LEDs and fewer wavelengths to rapidly collect data in a way that reduces motion artifacts and is independent of clinical lighting conditions. In addition, we will develop a machine learning based classification framework that will provide the clinical with actionalble diagnostic information. The central aim of this 3 year competing R01 renewal is to characterize and then modify a new clinic-friendly SFDI device (Clarifi) to objectively classify in- vivo regions of different burn severity over large areas. The proposed research seeks to investigate this via the following Specific Aims: 1) Test & Validate Clinical SFDI Instrument, 2) Compare Clinical SFDI Instrument to other Modalities on a Long Term Swine Model of Graded Burns, 3) Develop Spatially Resolved Classification Maps of Burn Severity based on SFDI Data, 4) Conduct Clinical Measurements of Burn Severity using the new SFDI device and Spatially Resolved Burn Severity Classification Maps based on SFDI data. Program Director (Last, first, middle): Durkin, Anthony J. PROJECT NARRATIVE Burn injuries rank in the top 15 causes of global burden of disease. Burn severity assessment, which is a critical step in treatment planning, is subjective, depending on the experience of the treating physician. This leads to misdiagnosis and increased days of hospitalization and cost. In order to address this, we propose to test, validate and apply a novel optical imaging device in order to provide noninvasive objective assessment of burn wound severity.

"Robot-Assisted 3D ICE Catheter for Cardiac Ablation ABSTRACT  Although the cardiac ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation has a wide adoption rate, it also has a high recurrence of arrhythmia primarily due to the creation of suboptimal lesions. The procedure is also associated with complications including cardiac perforation, tamponade, atrio-esophageal fistulas and thrombus. Repeated and prolonged X-ray exposure for the clinician can also lead to enhanced risk of cancer. A fluoroless approach using intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is becoming a more widely adopted imaging option due to the absence of ionizing radiation and the possibility of real-time monitoring of the created lesions. However, the ICE- guided approach suffers from significant shortcomings, which include poor dexterity of the ICE catheter, difficulty in simultaneously manipulating the ICE and ablation catheters, unintuitive image orientation and noisy image quality. There is therefore an unmet need to overcome these shortcomings of the ICE-guided approach to enable better lesion creation and reduced complications associated with the cardiac ablation procedure. The long-term goal of this research is to develop robotic technologies, control and machine learning algorithms to enable ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. The objective is to develop a novel robotic manipulator, a steerable ICE catheter, and machine learning and control algorithms to manipulate the ICE catheter and monitor the created lesions in real-time. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that the robot-assisted steerable ICE catheter with the catheter tracking algorithms will enable simultaneous manipulation of the ICE and ablation catheters. Further, the machine learning algorithms to monitor therapy will reduce the risk of complications, while ensuring the creation of necrotic lesions, thereby reducing the recurrence of AF. In this proposal, we plan to pursue the following specific aims: 1) Design, develop, and model a steerable 3D ICE catheter with enhanced dexterity. 2) Design and develop a robotic manipulator and associated control algorithms to allow for precise manipulation of the ICE catheter. 3) Develop machine-learning and vision-based algorithms integrated with a navigation system for tracking the ablation catheter, and monitoring therapy. 4) Validate the robotic ICE system in heart phantom and porcine models. The proposed research is significant since it will allow for better therapeutic outcomes by reducing recurrence rates and complications associated with cardiac ablation, and avoiding exposure of the patient and clinical care team to X-ray radiation. The proposed research is innovative in that it builds on state-of-the-art robotics technology, machine learning and vision algorithms to enable fluoroless ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study addresses an important and under-investigated area of treating atrial fibrillation using a completely fluoroless approach with ICE imaging.

"Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD Abstract Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is exceptionally common, with an estimated one hundred million afflicted people in the United States. Detection and risk stratification of this very common disease remains a major challenge. Despite recent advances, including development of numerous therapeutic agents presently in phase 2 and 3 trials, NAFLD remains a silent disease in which the vast majority of patients accumulate progressive liver damage without signs or symptoms and, undiagnosed, receive no medical care. The NAFLD patients at highest risk of cirrhosis are those with moderate or greater liver fibrosis at the time of diagnosis, a group of patients who are described as having high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH). The current reference standard for identifying people with hrNASH is liver biopsy, which is expensive, invasive, and limited by interobserver variability. The focus of this project is to develop and validate low cost non-invasive diagnostic technology to diagnose hrNASH. We propose to accomplish this in three Specific Aims. First, we will expand and annotate an existing database of patients with chronic liver disease from 328 subjects to 1,000 subjects, ~40% of whom will have NAFLD. The database will contain ~20,000 images (~10,000 ultrasound elastography images and ~ 10,000 conventional ultrasound images) and multiple demographic and clinical data points for each subject (a total of ~30,000 clinical, laboratory, and demographic data points). We have previously developed advanced image processing techniques to make ultrasound elastography more accurate and less variable. We will use this large database to develop, customize and refine our image processing techniques for NAFLD evaluation (Aim 1), with the goal of improving ultrasound elastography diagnosis of hrNASH. Second, we will combine conventional ultrasound elastography imaging, conventional ultrasound imaging, our advanced image analysis techniques, and the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data in a machine learning model to predict hrNASH and will compare the performance of our predictive model with the FIB4, a widely-used blood test-based prediction rule (Aim 2). Third, we will validate our predictive model in an independent prospective cohort of NAFLD subjects undergoing biopsy for NAFLD risk stratification (Aim 3). We hypothesize that the combination of image processing-enhanced elastography and conventional ultrasound imagery combined with demographic, clinical, and laboratory data will have greater predictive power for hrNASH than clinical or sonographic data alone. The proposed predictive models have the potential to (1) reduce the number of liver biopsies performed for hrNASH detection, (2) facilitate recruitment for clinical trials of NAFLD therapeutics, and (3) improve care quality for the most common liver disease in the United States. Project Narrative In this project, we aim to create low-cost non-invasive technology to diagnose people with high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH), a common liver disease that has a high risk of cirrhosis. We will accomplish this goal by improving liver ultrasound imaging and by creating a prediction tool that integrates liver ultrasound, laboratory testing and clinical information. This prediction tool has the potential to reduce the need for liver biopsies.","Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD",9850968,R01DK119860,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Tests', 'Caring', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Laboratories', 'Liver', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase II/III Trial', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Prospective cohort', 'Quality of Care', 'ROC Curve', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'chronic liver disease', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'disorder subtype', 'elastography', 'hepatocellular injury', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'liver injury', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,442592,551214295,0.0009077329271188289
"Next generation machine vision for automated behavioral phenotyping of knock-in ALS-FTD mouse models Project Summary Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia FTD are devastating neurodegenerative disorders that lie on a genetic and mechanistic continuum. ALS is a disease of motor neurons that that is almost uniformly lethal within only 3-5 years of diagnosis. FTD is a heterogeneous, rapidly progressing syndrome that is among the top three causes of presenile dementia. About 10% of ALS cases are caused by dominantly transmitted gene defects. SOD1 and FUS mutations cause aggressive motor neuron pathology while TDP43 mutations cause ALS-FTD. Further, wild type FUS and TDP43 are components of abnormal inclusions in many FTD cases, suggesting a mechanistic link between these disorders. Early phenotypes are of particular interest because these could lead to targeted interventions aimed at the root cause of the disorder that could stem the currently inexorable disease progression. Elucidating such early, potentially shared characteristics of these disorders should be greatly aided by: 1) knock-in animal models expressing familial ALS-FTD genes; 2) sensitive, rigorous and objective behavioral phenotyping methods to analyze and compare models generated in different laboratories. In published work the co-PIs applied their first-generation, machine vision-based automated phenotyping method, ACBM ‘1.0’ (automated continuous behavioral monitoring) to detect and quantify the earliest-observed phenotypes in Tdp43Q331K knock-in mice. This method entails continuous video recording for 5 days to generate >14 million frames/mouse. These videos are then scored by a trained computer vision system. In addition to its sensitivity, objectivity and reproducibility, a major advantage of this method is the ability to acquire and archive video recordings and to analyze the data at sites, including the Cloud, remote from those of acquisition. We will use Google Cloud TPUs supercomputers that have been designed from the ground up to accelerate cutting-edge machine learning workloads, with a special focus on deep learning. We will analyze this data using Bayesian hierarchical spline models that describe the different mouse behaviors along the circadian rhythm. The current proposal has two main goals: 1) Use deep learning to refine and apply a Next Generation ACBM - ‘2.0’ - that will allow for more sensitive, expansive and robust automated behavioral phenotyping of four novel knock-in models along with the well characterized SOD1G93A transgenic mouse. 2) To establish and validate procedures to enable remote acquisition of video recording data with cloud-based analysis. Our vision is to establish sensitive, robust, objective, and open-source machine vision-based behavioral analysis tools that will be widely available to researchers in the field. Since all the computer-annotated video data is standardized in ACBM 2.0 and will be archived, we envision a searchable ‘behavioral database’, that can be freely mined and analyzed. Such tools are critical to accelerate the development of novel and effective therapeutics for ALS-FTD. Narrative ALS and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) are devastating, rapidly progressing diseases and current treatments are of limited value. In this proposal a neuroscientist and a computer scientist have teamed up to develop a new machine vision-based method for behavioral analysis novel mouse models of ALS-FTD. The ultimate goal is to reveal early phenotypes in ALS-FTD models that can be used in understanding disease pathology and in the development of new therapeutic targets.",Next generation machine vision for automated behavioral phenotyping of knock-in ALS-FTD mouse models,9979408,R21NS112743,"['Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Expression Profiling', 'Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Paralysed', 'Pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Presenile Dementia', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Paralysis', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'TensorFlow', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Video Recording', 'Vision', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cloud based', 'data archive', 'deep learning', 'design', 'frontotemporal lobar dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'interest', 'knockin animal', 'machine vision', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'protein TDP-43', 'stem', 'supercomputer', 'superoxide dismutase 1', 'tool']",NINDS,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,446875,127562714,-0.009200789593667602
"Interpretable Deep Learning Algorithms for Pathology Image Analysis Interpretable Deep Learning Algorithms for Pathology Image Analysis Abstract The microscopic examination of stained tissue is a fundamental component of biomedical research and for the understanding of biological processes of disease which leads to improved diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic response prediction. Ranging from cancer diagnosis to heart rejection and forensics the subjective interpretation of histopathology sections forms the basis of clinical decision making and research outcomes. However, it has been shown that such subjective interpretation of pathology slides suffers from large interobserver and intraobserver variability. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning has enabled the objective and automated analysis of images. These methods have been applied with success to histology images which have demonstrated potential for development of objective image interpretation paradigms. However, significant algorithmic challenges remain to be addressed before such objective analysis of histology images can be used by clinicians and researchers. Leveraging extensive experience in developing and decimating research software based on deep learning the PI will pioneer novel algorithmic approaches to address these challenges including but not limited to: (1) training data-efficient and interpretable deep learning models with gigapixel size microscopy images for classification and segmentation using weakly supervised labels (2) fundamental redesign of data fusion paradigms for integrating information from microscopy images and molecular profiles (from multi-omics data) for improved diagnostic and prognostic determinations (3) developing visualization and interpretation software for researchers and clinical workflows to improve clinical and research validation and reproducability. The system will be designed in a modular, user-friendly manner and will be open-source, available through GitHub as universal plug-and-play modules ready to be adapted to various clinical and research applications. We will also develop a web resource with pretrained models for various organs, disease states and subtypes these will be accompanied with detailed manuals so researchers can apply deep learning to their specific research problems. Overall, the laboratory’s research will yield high impact discoveries from pathology image analysis, and its software will enable many other NIH funded laboratories to do the same, across various biomedical disciplines. Project Narrative The microscopic examination of stained tissue is a fundamental component of biomedical research, disease diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic response prediction.

"Scientific Questions: A New Target for Biomedical NLP Project Summary  Natural language processing (NLP) technology is now widespread (e.g. Google Translate) and has several important applications in biomedical research. We propose a new target for NLP: extraction of scientific questions stated in publications. A system that automatically captures and organizes scientific questions from across the biomedical literature could have a wide range of significant impacts, as attested to in our diverse collection of support letters from researchers, journal editors, educators and scientific foundations. Prior work focused on making binary (or probabilistic) assessments of whether a text is hedged or uncertain, with the goal of downgrading such statements in information extraction tasks—not computationally capturing what the uncertainty is about. In contrast, we propose an ambitious plan to identify, represent, integrate and reason about the content of scientific questions, and to demonstrate how this approach can be used to address two important new use cases in biomedical research: contextualizing experimental results and enhancing literature awareness. Contextualizing results is the task of linking elements of genome-scale results to open questions across all of biomedical research. Literature awareness is the ability to understand important characteristics of large, dynamic collections of research publications as a whole. We propose to produce rich computational representations of the dynamic evolution of research questions, and to prototype textual and visual interfaces to help students and researchers explore and develop a detailed understanding of key open scientific questions in any area of biomedical research. Project Narrative The scientific literature is full of statements of important unsolved questions. By using artificial intelligence systems to identify and categorize these questions, the proposed work would help other researchers discover when their findings might address an important question in another scientific area. This work would also make it easier for students, journal editors, conference organizers and others understand where science is headed by tracking the evolution of scientific questions.",Scientific Questions: A New Target for Biomedical NLP,10069773,R01LM013400,"['Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Biomedical Research', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Expert Systems', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Information Retrieval', 'Journals', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Students', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Visual', 'Work', 'design', 'dynamical evolution', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'graduate student', 'high throughput screening', 'innovation', 'journal article', 'news', 'novel', 'pharmacovigilance', 'prototype', 'symposium', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2020,462393,292134808,-0.007870326928249212
"A Novel Imaging Analysis Platform for Patients with Craniomaxillofacial Deformities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our ultimate goal is to improve our ability to create and measure 3D models derived from cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Our main motivation is to improve quality and reduce costs in care of patients with craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities. The resulted innovations will also impact other fields. CMF deformities involve congenital and acquired deformities of the jaws and face. A large number of patients in the US and around the world suffered from CMF deformities. The evaluation of these patients includes an assessment of CMF form on 3D models that are traditionally generated from segmented spiral multi-slice CTs (MSCTs). These models are also used to plan their treatment. The purpose of segmentation is to separate different anatomical structures and to remove the artifacts on the CTs. Once 3D models are generated from the segmented CTs, anatomical and teeth landmarks are manually digitized for measurements. Finally, diagnosis and treatment planning are performed based on measurements. Although MSCT provides high- quality images and thus allows relatively fast and easy post processing, many concerns have been raised on excessive radiation exposure to patients. Therefore, more doctors are now using CBCT scanners in their offices. CBCT has less radiation and is inexpensive compared to the MSCT, but their use in generating 3D models is greatly limited by the poor image quality, i.e., low contrast / signal-to-noise ratio and artifacts. Thus, the existing automated segmentation algorithms developed for MSCT are incapable of practically segmenting CBCTs. The current solution to CBCT segmentation entails an arduous and lengthy process that involves labor-intensive manual editing of hundreds of slices. Besides, another arduous and inaccurate task in the assessment of CMF deformities is the digitization of anatomical landmarks on 3D models - the first step to quantify the deformities. Currently a typical 3D cephalometric and teeth analysis requires the manual digitization of more than 200 landmarks, which is time consuming and has limited accuracy. We hypothesize that the creation and measurement of high-quality 3D models can be significantly improved by developing innovative CBCT-friendly post processing tools. Therefore, in this renewal project, we propose to develop and validate a novel CBCT analysis platform to automate the process of CBCT segmentation and landmark digitization. The feasibility of our approaches has already been proven by our preliminary studies. Our innovative CBCT analysis platform will significantly improve the quality and reduce the cost of care to the individuals with CMF conditions. It will change our dental/CMF fields in effectively utilizing CBCT as a guide for on-the-fly diagnosis and treatment planning. With minimal user intervention, the computer will accurately and effectively do the work, which is currently artistically done by the labor-intensive human operators. The resulted innovations may also impact other fields in the future, e.g., orthopedic surgery and cardiovascular surgery where intraoperative whole-body CBCT is acquired for image-guided surgery and intervention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is widely used in physician's offices for orthodontics, craniomaxillofacial (CMF) surgery, facial plastic surgery and dentistry, but its segmentation and landmark digitization have to be completed artistically by human operators, which is labor-intensive and with limited accuracy.  We propose to develop and validate an innovative CBCT post processing system to automate the processes of CBCT segmentation and landmark digitization with minimal user intervention.  The proposed system will significantly improve the quality and reduce the cost of care to the individuals  with CMF conditions, and also change 1) the fields of orthodontics, CMF surgery and general dentistry in  effectively utilizing CBCT as a guide for diagnosis and treatment planning, and 2) the fields of orthopedic  surgery, general surgery, and cardiovascular surgery where the quality and the speed of intraoperative imaging is critical.",A Novel Imaging Analysis Platform for Patients with Craniomaxillofacial Deformities,9840832,R01DE022676,"['3-Dimensional', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Back', 'Cardiovascular Surgical Procedures', 'Cephalometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computed Tomography Scanners', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consultations', 'Consumption', 'Deformity', 'Dental Care', 'Dentistry', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Jaw', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Orthodontics', 'Orthopedic Surgery procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians&apos', ' Offices', 'Plastic Surgical Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'care costs', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'cost', 'craniofacial', 'craniomaxillofacial', 'design', 'detector', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'open source', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'segmentation algorithm', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'virtual surgery']",NIDCR,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,495143,27487788,0.0009202010414597102
"Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction Project Summary We propose a novel way of reconstructing medical images rooted in deep learning and computer vision that models the process how human radiologists are using years of experience from reading thousands of cases to recognize anatomical structures, pathologies and image artifacts. Our approach is based on the novel idea of a variational network, which embeds a generalized compressed sensing concept within a deep learning framework. We propose to learn a complete reconstruction procedure, including filter kernels and penalty functions to separate between true image content and artifacts, all parameters that normally have to be tuned manually as well as the associated numerical algorithm described by this variational network. The training step is decoupled from the time critical image reconstruction step, which can then be performed in near-real-time without interruption of clinical workflow. Our preliminary patient data from accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions suggest that our learning approach outperforms the state-of-the-art of currently existing image reconstruction methods and is robust with respect to the variations that arise in a daily clinical imaging situation. In our first aim, we will test the hypothesis that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition. In the second aim, we will answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications. Finally, we will perform a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee. We will compare our proposed approach to a clinical standard reconstruction. Our hypothesis is that our approach will lead to the same clinical diagnosis and patient management decisions when using a 5min exam. The immediate benefit of the project is to bring accelerated imaging to an application with wide public-health impact, thereby improving clinical outcomes and reducing health-care costs. Additionally, the insights gained from the developments in this project will answer the currently most important open questions in the emerging field of machine learning for medical image reconstruction. Finally, given the recent increase of activities in this field, there is a significant demand for a publicly available data repository for raw k-space data that can be used for training and validation. Since all data that will be acquired in this project will be made available to the research community, this project will be a first step to meet this demand. Project Narrative The overarching goal of the proposal is to develop a novel machine learning-based image reconstruction approach and validate it for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The approach is able to learn the characteristic appearance of clinical imaging datasets, as well as suppression of artifacts that arise during data acquisition. We will test the hypotheses that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition, answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications, and validate our approach in a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee.",Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction,9997914,R01EB024532,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Step training', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'patient population', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,498014,329565273,0.0023510628614580196
"Integrative Predictors of Temporomandibular Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This application proposes the development of efficient web-based data management, mining, and analytics, to integrate and analyze clinical, biological, and high dimensional imaging data from TMJ OA patients. Based on our published results, we hypothesize that patterns of condylar bone structure, clinical symptoms, and biological mediators are unrecognized indicators of the severity of progression of TMJ OA. Efficiently capturing, curating, managing, integrating and analyzing this data in a manner that maximizes its value and accessibility is critical for the scientific advances and benefits that such comprehensive TMJ OA patient information may enable. High dimensional databases are increasingly difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional processing applications, creating a continuing demand for innovative approaches. Toward this end, the DCBIA at the Univ. of Michigan has partnered with the University of North Carolina, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Kitware Inc. Through high-dimensional quantitative characterization of individuals with TMJ OA, at molecular, clinical and imaging levels, we will identify phenotypes at risk for more severe prognosis, as well as targets for future therapies. The proposed web-based system, the Data Storage for Computation and Integration (DSCI), will remotely compute machine learning, image analysis, and advanced statistics from prospectively collected longitudinal data on patients with TMJ OA. Due to its ubiquitous design in the web, DSCI software installation will no longer be required. Our long-term goal is to create software and data repository for Osteoarthritis of the TMJ. Such repository requires maintaining the data in a distributed computational environment to allow contributions to the database from multi-clinical centers and to share trained models for TMJ classification. In years 4 and 5 of the proposed work, the dissemination and training of clinicians at the Schools of Dentistry at the University of North Carol, Univ. of Minnesota and Oregon Health Sciences will allow expansion of the proposed studies. In Aim 1, we will test state-of-the-art neural network structures to develop a combined software module that will include the most efficient and accurate neural network architecture and advanced statistics to mine imaging, clinical and biological TMJ OA markers identified at baseline. In Aim 2, we propose to develop novel data analytics tools, evaluating the performance of various machine learning and statistical predictive models, including customized- Gaussian Process Regression, extreme boosted trees, Multivariate Varying Coefficient Model, Lasso, Ridge and Elastic net, Random Forest, pdfCluster, decision tree, and support vector machine. Such automated solutions will leverage emerging computing technologies to determine risk indicators for OA progression in longitudinal cohorts of TMJ health and disease.

"Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):1 Of all markers of human health, the most intuitive is body shape but based on quantitative evidence.  2 Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio  3 (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality  4 risk than body mass index (BMI). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can quantify regional adiposity in  5 more detail than the above measures but is underutilized for many reasons including potential harm from  6 ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments  7 in the ""quantified self movement"" to better describe phenotypes of body shape and its relation to metabolic  8 risks. The candidate developed in this proposal is 3D optical whole body scanning. If successful, sophisticated  9 obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with 10 disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment 11 technology. Whole body 3D imaging technology is already so accessible that it can be done with video games 12 such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect, and consumer cameras. 13 The long term goal of the Optical Body Shape and Health Assessment Study is 1) to provide phenotype 14 descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in 15 research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive 16 models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, 17 muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat), and then show how our 3DO body composition estimates are 18 associated to important metabolic risk factors. Our central hypothesis is that 3DO measures of body 19 composition with shape classification better predict metabolic risk factors than anthropometry or DXA body 20 composition alone. Our specific aims are: 1. Identify the unique associations of body shape to body 21 composition indices in a population that represents the variance of sex, age, BMI, and ethnicity found 22 in the US population; 2. Describe the precision and accuracy of 3DO scans to monitor change in body 23 composition and metabolic health interventions; and 3. Estimate the level of association of 3DO to 24 common health indicators including metabolic risk factors by gender, race, age, and BMI. In an 25 exploratory aim, we investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct 26 predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class 27 Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self- 28 assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US 29 population, and how these models relate to important metabolic status and body composition. The positive 30 impact will be the immediate applicability to clinicians and individuals for personalized risk assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of who is at high risk of metabolic diseases because of a poor metabolic profile. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults.

"Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure. Finally, WUSM will make a clear institutional commitment to maintain its Clinical Site, to adapt UDN Phase I practices for sustainability, to contribute to formation of a sustainable national UDN resource, and to adapt to unique needs and unexpected circumstances that may arise once Common Fund support ends in fiscal year 2022. 2.0 PROJECT NARRATIVE Undiagnosed diseases in children and adults represent frustrating and costly challenges for patients, families, physicians, and society. Building on established institutional infrastructure similar to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) will establish a UDN Clinical Site to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases, facilitate research into the etiology of undiagnosed diseases, and promote an integrated and collaborative community across multiple UDN Clinical Sites, Sequencing Cores, Model Organisms Screening Centers, and among laboratory and clinical investigators. Specifically, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will annually recruit, select, evaluate, and follow 30 participants with disorders in any clinical specialty, adult and pediatric, provide comprehensive clinical evaluations that require <5 days and follow up, and participate in all UDN protocols, data management and sharing, and sustainability planning.",Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site,9977220,U01HG010215,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accreditation', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Consent', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Physicians', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Secure', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data dissemination', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'network models', 'operation', 'outreach', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'student training', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,550000,533594881,-0.003027232731578353
"A Transfer Learning Framework for Creating Subject-Specific Musculoskeletal Models of the Hand PROJECT SUMMARY Restoring hand function remains an elusive goal for many clinical conditions, including stroke, osteoarthritis, tetraplegia, amputation, and traumatic injury. The hand’s anatomical complexity makes restoring hand function particularly challenging because altering any one parameter in the hand can have cascading effects that are difficult to predict, but essential to control. In this proposal, as a critical step toward informing personalized treatments for the hand, we will study how subject-specific differences influence hand function. Completion of this proposal will rely on collection of three datasets that are designed to provide varying levels of biomechanical detail and require varying levels of effort to collect. Briefly, these datasets include (1) a simulation dataset containing 500,000 simulations fully describing all musculoskeletal parameters involved in hand force production, (2) a dense, biomechanical datasets that describes the kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activity required for hand force production in 30 adults, and (3) a sparse, clinically-inspired dataset that describes demographics, anthropometrics, and clinical metrics of hand function in 1000 adults. In Aim 1, we will leverage the first two datasets to design a data-driven analysis framework that identifies the most important biomechanical parameter(s) and maps how those parameters influence hand force production. Completion of this aim will elucidate the biomechanical mechanisms that modulate hand force production and evaluate the ability to use simulation data, instead of experimental data, to identify these mechanisms. In Aim 2, we will leverage all three datasets to create a transfer learning framework capable of efficiently and accurately predicting subject-specific muscle force-generating parameters from easy to collect clinical data. We specifically focus on muscle force- generating parameters because these parameters remain challenging to quickly and accurately estimate, are known to vary across the population, and are highly related to functional metrics like strength. Completion of this aim will provide a new approach for rapidly estimating subject-specific musculoskeletal parameters, thereby enabling efficient creation of subject-specific models and potentially catalyzing use of such models in a clinical setting. Overall, the results from this study could enhance our ability to provide personalized diagnoses and prognoses for individuals suffering from hand impairments. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project aims to understand the biomechanical mechanisms underlying force production in the hand. Specifically, we utilize machine learning methods to examine how subject-specific differences influence hand force production and create subject-specific computer models from easy to obtain clinical data. The results, which integrate modeling with an individual’s clinical data, could enhance our ability to provide personalized diagnoses and prognoses for individuals suffering from hand impairments.",A Transfer Learning Framework for Creating Subject-Specific Musculoskeletal Models of the Hand,10040078,R21EB030068,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Amputation', 'Anatomy', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Diagnostic', 'Floor', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hand Strength', 'Hand functions', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Production', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quadriplegia', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Stroke', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Testing', 'Traumatic injury', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'bone', 'computational platform', 'computerized tools', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'design', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'hand dysfunction', 'hand rehabilitation', 'individual patient', 'kinematics', 'machine learning method', 'motor control', 'neural network', 'neuromuscular', 'novel strategies', 'open-access repositories', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'random forest', 'simulation', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R21,2020,560939,188894159,-0.016895976906682403
"Computational and Statistical Framework to Model Tissue Shape and Mechanics PROJECT SUMMARY  The morphologic and mechanical characteristics of a tissue are fundamental to understanding the development, homeostasis, and pathology of the human body. During the previous period of funding, we developed statistical shape modeling (SSM) methods and applied these to the study of structural hip disease. We also developed the initial framework to integrate SSM with finite element (FE) analysis to enable the study of shape and mechanics together. If incorporated into clinical practice, SSM and FE analysis could identify features of the anatomy likely responsible for injury, remodeling, or repair. Geometry needed for SSM and FE models is typically generated by segmentation of volumetric imaging data. This step can be painstakingly slow, error prone, and cost prohibitive, which hampers clinical application of these computational techniques. We have created a deep machine learning algorithm ‘DeepSSM’ that uses a convolutional neural network to establish the correspondence model directly from unsegmented images. In Aim 1 we will apply DepSSM to improve clinical understanding of structural hip disease by characterizing differences in anatomy between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals; these morphometric comparisons will identify anatomic features most telling of disease, thereby guiding improvements in diagnosis. Computational advancements have simplified the process to generate patient-specific FE models, enabling clinically focused research. However, there is no framework to collectively visualize, compare, and interpret (i.e., post-process) results from multiple FE models. Currently, inter-subject comparisons require oversimplifications such as averaging results over subjectively defined regions. In Aim 2 we will develop new post-processing methods to collectively visualize, interpret and statistically analyze FE results across multiple subjects and study groups. We will map FE results to synthetic anatomies representing statistically meaningful distributions using the correspondence model. Statistical parametric mapping will be applied to preserve anatomic detail through statistical testing. We will use our published FE models of hip joint mechanics as the test system. Finally, volumetric images provide a wealth of information that is delivered to physicians in a familiar format. Yet, tools are not available to interpret model data with clinical findings from volumetric images. In Aim 3, we will develop methods that evaluate relationships between shape, mechanics, and clinical findings gleaned from imaging through integrated statistical tests and semi-automatic medical image annotation tools that utilize standard ontologies. Quantitative CT and MRI images of the hip, which estimate bone density and cartilage ultrastructure, respectively, will be evaluated as test datasets. To impart broad impact, we will disseminate our methods to the community as open source software that will call core functionality provided by existing, open source software that has a large user base (FEBio, ShapeWorks). PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed technology will provide the methodologies necessary to increase the clinical acceptance and applicability of computer models. These models measure three-dimensional tissue shape and estimate tissue mechanics, providing information that cannot be measured conventionally. We will implement these methods into software that can be used by the public free-of-charge.",Computational and Statistical Framework to Model Tissue Shape and Mechanics,9972694,R01EB016701,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Bone Density', 'Cardiology', 'Cartilage', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Glean', 'Grooming', 'Hip Joint', 'Hip region structure', 'Homeostasis', 'Human Pathology', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Libraries', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurology', 'Ontology', 'Orthopedics', 'Pathology', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'annotation  system', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'disease diagnosis', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'relating to nervous system', 'repaired', 'shape analysis', 'simulation', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,563658,228951281,-0.001986345188007281
"Next-Generation Ultrasound Localization Microscopy Project Summary/Abstract Abnormal alterations of tissue microcirculation are often associated with early stage of tissue pathology. Detection and characterization of these early microvascular abnormalities can greatly benefit clinical diagnosis and treatment monitoring as well as facilitating the creation of new therapies to counter disease development. For decades, there has been a longstanding quest for the development of a clinical imaging modality that can noninvasively and directly image such tissue microvascular variations. To date, however, such an imaging method remains elusive due to the fundamental compromise between imaging spatial resolution and depth penetration. Therefore, the long-term objective of this project is to fulfill this unmet clinical need by developing the next-generation ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM), which is an ultrasound-based imaging technique that can directly assess structural and functional tissue microvasculature in vivo in humans at a clinically relevant depth. Different from other imaging modalities, ULM is not limited by the resolution-penetration compromise: ULM can noninvasively image capillary-scale microvessels at several centimeters depth and quantitatively measure their blood flow speed (as low as 1 mm/s). Such combination of deep imaging penetration and exquisite spatial resolution and the unique functionality of measuring small vessel blood flow speed make ULM a promising technique for many clinical applications including cancer and cardiovascular diseases. At present, however, ULM is not ready for clinical use due to several key technical limitations: 1) ULM data acquisition is very slow (tens of seconds with breath holding); 2) ULM post-processing is very expensive computationally (several hours to generate a single 2D ULM image); 3) ULM is difficult to be extended to 3D imaging (which is important for comprehensive evaluation of tissue microvasculature such as in cancer applications). These limitations largely forbids ULM from being effectively used in the clinic to provide useful microvascular biomarkers. In this proposal, we will concentrate on addressing these technical barriers and transform ULM to a truly useful clinical imaging tool. Our approach synergistically combines deep learning (DL), parallel computing, and ultrafast 3D ultrasound imaging to fundamentally shorten ULM data acquisition time, substantially accelerate ULM post-processing, and enhance ULM to 3D imaging. Our first aim will develop and validate DL-based ULM data processing algorithms that would enable real-time 4D morphometric ULM and fast 3D quantitative ULM. Our method uniquely collects real labeled optical imaging data on a chicken embryo microvessel model for DL training. Our second aim will focus on realizing 3D-ULM on a 2D row-column-addressing transducer with ultrafast 3D plane wave imaging. We will develop a DL-based beamforming technique to enable high-fidelity 3D microbubble imaging for robust 3D-ULM. Our final aim will focus on validating the in vivo performance of the newly developed 3D-ULM imaging techniques on a mouse tumor model. We will be collaborating with world-renowned experts in deep learning, optical imaging, and comparative medicine at the University of Illinois to accomplish these aims of the proposal. Project Narrative Imaging-based detection and characterization of abnormal tissue microvascular variations is clinically significant for diagnosis, treatment evaluation, and therapy development in many pathologies such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, inflammation, and neurodegenerative diseases. At present, there is no viable noninvasive imaging tool that can fulfill this important clinical need. To fill this gap, we propose to develop a new ultrasound-based super-resolution microvessel imaging technique that can directly and quantitatively assess the structure and the function of tissue microcirculation in vivo in humans.",Next-Generation Ultrasound Localization Microscopy,10039725,R21EB030072,"['3-Dimensional', '3D ultrasound', '4T1', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Breast Carcinoma', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chickens', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incentives', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microbubbles', 'Microcirculation', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Nutrient', 'Organ', 'Oxygen', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Transportation', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'microCT', 'microscopic imaging', 'next generation', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optical imaging', 'parallel computer', 'performance tests', 'quantitative ultrasound', 'real-time images', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tumor', 'two photon microscopy']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2020,565346,76545728,-0.01850017801150682
"A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration PROJECT SUMMARY Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in the dry or wet form, is the leading cause of vision loss in the developed countries. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) showed that specific antioxidant vitamin supplementation reduces the risk of progression from intermediate stages to late AMD and maintains visual acuity in approximately 25% of patients. While treatment of wet AMD with Intraocular injections can be effective in maintaining vision, such treatments are costly and may be associated with significant cardiovascular risks, or even progression of dry AMD. Hence, it is critical to identify patients at the earlier stages. Unfortunately, there is no effective, automated screening tool to accomplish this, and the patients themselves may be asymptomatic. The goal of this SBIR Direct-to-Phase II proposal is to provide such tool. We have demonstrated the feasibility of AMD screening software ‘iPredictTM’ by successfully identifying 98.1% of individuals with early or intermediate stage AMD. iPredictTM also successfully predicted which individuals would develop late AMD within one year with 87.8% accuracy and two years with 88.4% accuracy. iPredictTM has prototype components for image analysis and machine learning. We also developed a HIPAA compliant telemedicine platform which will enable iPredictTM to perform large-scale screening from remote and rural areas. In order to bring the product to market, these components need to be integrated and tested which is the aim of our proposed Direct-to-Phase II proposal. We aim to develop the finished product which will be ready for the market. We also aim to evaluate the efficacy of iPredictTM in a clinical setup. The AMD preventative market is estimated around $5.4 billion in the U.S. alone. iPredictTM will capture the major market share with its best accuracy and be the first prediction tool for AMD. We aim to commercialize iPredictTM for the screening and prevention of AMD, saving millions of citizens from blindness and reduced quality of life. With iPredictTM’s improvements in speed of delivery, cost of care, and ease of access, the product will be a significant addition to the healthcare system. The iPredictTM’s telemedicine platform will allow large-scale screening from remote/rural areas, primary care clinics, optometry offices and ophthalmology clinics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in its late forms, “dry” or “wet”, is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the progression of early to late AMD. Hence, the identification of patients with early AMD and referral to an ophthalmologist is critically needed to help prevent vision loss. To achieve this goal, we propose to develop an automated screening and prediction system that can be widely deployed to identify these individuals at risk of vision loss.",A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration,10010769,R44EY031202,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'American', 'Antioxidants', 'Blindness', 'Categories', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Drusen', 'Ear', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fees', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Java', 'Lasers', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Modeling', 'New York', 'Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Pythons', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sales', 'Savings', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Side', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Smoking', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Sun Exposure', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Trademark', 'Treatment Cost', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Acuity', 'Vitamins', 'age related', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care costs', 'checkup examination', 'commercial application', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'photobiomodulation', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'retinal imaging', 'rural area', 'screening', 'sociodemographic factors', 'software as a service', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NEI,"IHEALTHSCREEN, INC.",R44,2020,585067,585067,-0.01071341256234673
"Improving Liver Ultrasound Image Quality in Difficult-to-Image Patients ABSTRACT The prevalence of obesity in the United States has risen to record levels over the past 40 years, putting strain on the healthcare system and creating difficult challenges for medical imaging. We propose to overcome the challenges that obesity poses to ultrasound imaging by (1) developing novel image-quality improvement techniques, and (2) implementing them on pulse-echo ultrasound imaging systems to yield high-quality images of the liver. Ultrasound imaging is uniquely affected by the presence of additional connective tissue and thick subcutaneous fat layers in overweight and obese patients; these additional subcutaneous layers greatly exacerbate reverberation and phase-aberration of the acoustic wave, leading to high levels of clutter, degraded resolution, and overall poor-quality ultrasound images. Our proposed methods will determine the local speed-of-sound in abdominal tissue layers and use this information to accomplish distributed phase-aberration correction. We also apply machine learning techniques to model and suppress the effects of reverberation clutter and speckle noise. The combination of these techniques is expected to achieve significant improvements in liver image quality. These image-quality improvement methods will be implemented on a real-time ultrasound scanner and will be evaluated in clinical imaging tasks of overweight and obese patients undergoing ultrasound surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma. Successful development of the proposed technology will not only enable high-quality ultrasound imaging of the liver in otherwise difficult-to-image overweight and obese patients, but also facilitate improved image quality across nearly all ultrasound imaging applications, for all populations. NARRATIVE This proposal aims to develop and test several new techniques to overcome the current limitations of ultrasound to make high-quality images in overweight and obese individuals. These novel ultrasound techniques will be initially applied to improve liver imaging in overweight and obese patients in a pilot study, though the benefits of this new high-quality imaging technology will extend to all other areas of clinical ultrasound imaging.",Improving Liver Ultrasound Image Quality in Difficult-to-Image Patients,9885175,R01EB027100,"['Abdomen', 'Acoustics', 'Affect', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiac', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Connective Tissue', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Obesity', 'Output', 'Overweight', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Weight', 'clinical imaging', 'elastography', 'epidemiology study', 'fetal', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'liver imaging', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prototype', 'radio frequency', 'simulation', 'sound', 'subcutaneous']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,590183,560644462,0.002744852107047379
"MR Fingerprinting for Epilepsy Abstract Epilepsy affects 65 million people worldwide; approximately 30% of them do not respond to medications but can be cured by surgery. Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a major pathology for medically intractable epilepsies, is frequently missed by visual analysis of the conventional MRI, making surgical treatment very difficult. We propose to develop a novel quantitative MRI acquisition and analysis framework specific for epilepsy patients, which could provide more sensitive and specific measures of brain structure, thereby improving FCD detection and subtype prediction. To this end, the quantitative framework will be developed and validated in three steps: (1) Develop high-resolution Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) scan that allows simultaneous quantification of multiple tissue property maps efficiently, accurately and precisely. These quantitative maps have shown to be more sensitive and specific on detecting and characterizing subtle signal abnormalities. (2) Develop image post-processing methods to analyze quantitative maps, which will provide quantitative measurements that highlight additional morphological features, such as gray-white boundary blurring, abnormal cortical thickness and folding. (3) Develop machine-learning-based feature screening and prediction tools to characterize group-level features differentiating FCD subtypes, and predict individual-level FCD location and subtyping. Because detection and subtype prediction of FCD are both associated with seizure outcomes, epileptologists can use this tool to provide more personalized and customized counseling. The result of our proposed work promises a paradigm shift by converting the current standard-care of visual/qualitative MRI review to a quantitative framework, including data acquisition, post-processing and decision support tool, that would eventually lead to better treatment planning, reduction in unnecessary pre-surgical evaluation tests (especially invasive evaluation), and improved post-operative seizure outcomes in patients with devastating and disabling medically intractable epilepsy. The quantitative nature of our acquisition/analysis methods also makes it possible to be uniformly adopted by other centers with high consistency.

Specifically, we propose to develop and deploy artificial intelligence (AI) methods to enable chest x-ray radiography (CXR) as an alternative diagnostic tool to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia, to rapidly triage patients for appropriate treatment, to monitor the treatment response in a contained environment, and to optimize the distribution of the limited medical resources during the current COVID-19 crisis. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project, our overarching objective is to develop automated artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms to help radiologists to differentiate COVID-19 related pneumonia from other non-COVID-19 related pneumonia using CXR images. The advantages of the proposed AI equipped CXR technique include: i) widely available, ii) inexpensive, iii) excellent coronavirus exposure profile for patient, technologist, and equipment, and iv) rapid and automated DL interpretation, which is effectively instantaneous.",Development and Deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Driven Methods to Enable Chest X-ray Radiography as an Alternative Diagnostic Method for COVID-19 Pneumonia,10156179,U01EB021183,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'American College of Radiology', 'Anosmia', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bilateral', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Case Study', 'Cessation of life', 'China', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Containment', 'Coronavirus', 'Coughing', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'European', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Fever', 'Glass', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'North America', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pleural effusion disorder', 'Pneumonia', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rural', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Societies', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Viral Pneumonia', 'War', 'World Health Organization', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'chest computed tomography', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical translation', 'combat', 'deep learning', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'imaging facilities', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'neural network architecture', 'pandemic disease', 'prevent', 'profiles in patients', 'quantum', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'urgent care']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U01,2020,605070,338121506,-0.006425727510755923
"Learning to Predict Delayed Cerebral Ischemia with Novel Continuous Cerebral Arterial State Index Project Summary  Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is the most devastating complication after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and has an incidence rate of 30%. Current practice relies on intermittent assessment of neurological status and daily cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) by Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) to guide medical management to prevent DCI. Only after medical management fails, is endovascular treatment (EVT) including intraarterial vasodilator infusion and/or intracranial angioplasty initiated. This reactive practice does not account for early predictors of DCI and may miss the optimal EVT window at an early stage of DCI development before symptoms or severe deviations from normal hemodynamics. The goal of this project is to develop algorithms to predict DCI and related targets at an early stage in their development. An accurate prediction of DCI will enable a more proactive strategy to prevent and treat the underlying cause of DCI.  The following three aims will be pursued towards the goal of the project: 1) Develop aSAH-specific intracranial pressure (ICP) pulse-based cerebral arterial state index; 2) Develop and validate predictive models of targets related to delayed cerebral ischemia after aSAH; 3) Conduct a prospective institution- specific adaption and validation of the developed models.  Our DCI predictive algorithms only need data available in current clinical practice hence they can be readily adopted. If validated, these algorithms will enable clinicians to monitor risk of DCI continuously and to proactively deliver appropriate treatment. The proposed prospective study of algorithm implementation and adaptation will well prepare future clinical trials to test the efficacy of algorithm-informed interventions.

"BDD CIS: Big Data Driven Clinical Informatics & Surveillance - A Multimodal Database Focused Clinical, Community, & Multi-Omics Surveillance Plan for COVID19 Abstract With South Carolina’s population already being vulnerable to poor health as evidenced by poor national health rankings, challenging rural geography and health professional shortages, the impact of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) will be long lasting in the state. Patient morbidity and mortality rates already continue to increase, with ongoing economic damage to health systems and businesses. The speed of transmission and geographical spread of COVID-19 across South Carolina and the United States is alarming, which combined with the novel nature of the disease justifies the need for accelerated research to combat this pandemic. As clinicians and frontline health workers battle to save lives, creating a data environment that accelerates research is key, and necessary to battle the disease. Access to such information will equip frontline health workers to continue the fight against the disease. This proposal will build the capacity for accelerated research and intelligence gathering by coalescing multiple state partners and leveraging relevant data for discoveries around COVID-19. To accomplish this, this proposal aims to (1) create a de-identified linked database system via REDCap and a mobile application (app) to collate surveillance, clinical, multi-omics and geospatial data on both COVID-19 patients and health workers treating COVID-19 patients in South Carolina; (2) examine the natural history of COVID-19 including transmission dynamics, disease progression, and geospatial visualization; and (3) identify important predictors of short- and long-term clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients in South Carolina using machine learning algorithms. These aims will be accomplished through collaborations with multiple state agencies and stakeholders relevant to COVID-19 and the creation of a REDCap database and mobile app that allow for coalescing relevant data in a timely fashion, combined with leveraging of statewide integrated data warehouse capabilities. Project Narrative COVID-19 represents an opportunity to create and deploy a research system that allows accelerated research on any pandemic. While South Carolina is rural in nature, and has low health rankings, it has a powerful integrated health data infrastructure that allows for tracking short-and long-term clinical and health system impacts of pandemics like the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The creation of multiple data sources at the individual level, coupled with innovative big data science techniques will advance important discoveries in disease surveillance, transmission, natural history and progression important for treatment and necessary for targeted intervention purposes in South Carolina.","BDD CIS: Big Data Driven Clinical Informatics & Surveillance - A Multimodal Database Focused Clinical, Community, & Multi-Omics Surveillance Plan for COVID19",10136980,R01AI127203,"['2019-nCoV', 'Active Learning', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Businesses', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Chest', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collaborations', 'Common Cold', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confidentiality of Patient Information', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Sources', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Professional', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Partners', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Provider', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rural', 'SARS coronavirus', 'Secure', 'Series', 'Source', 'South Carolina', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'Virus', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'big-data science', 'combat', 'data infrastructure', 'data management', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'disability', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene therapy', 'health data', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple data sources', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel coronavirus', 'novel virus', 'pandemic disease', 'patient privacy', 'precision medicine', 'response', 'systems research', 'time use', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'virology']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2020,626275,45219910,-0.008104928505044602
"Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking PROJECT SUMMARY  Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures tissue parameters such as T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion to detect subtle differences in tissue states (such as microstructure, diffuse fibrosis, edema, hemorrhage, and iron content) from neurological, oncological, and cardiovascular diseases. Because each parameter offers complementary tissue information, multiparameter mapping is very promising for risk assessment, early detection, accurate staging, and treatment monitoring of disease. However, quantitative MRI is typically very time consuming and difficult to perform. Each parameter is typically measured from its own series of images, so measuring multiple parameters leads to long, inefficient scanning sessions. Furthermore, cardiac and breathing motion creates misalignment between images, causing additional problems.  The standard approach to motion is to either remove it (e.g., ask the patient to hold their breath) or to synchronize image acquisition with it (e.g., using electrocardiography (ECG) to monitor cardiac motion). This approach makes scan times even longer, limits imaging to patients who can repeatedly perform long breath holds (which is difficult for aging or weak patients) and who have predictable cardiac motion (which is not true of patients with cardiac arrhythmias). Furthermore, these methods are often unreliable and difficult to perform.  This project is to develop and validate a new technology, MR Multitasking, to perform multiple simultaneous measurements in a single, push-button scan that is both comfortable for patients and simple for technologists to perform. MR Multitasking redesigns quantitative MRI around the concept of images as functions of many time dimensions, each corresponding to a different dynamic process (e.g., motion, T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion), and then uses mathematical models called low-rank tensors to perform fast, multidimensional imaging. This allows continuous acquisition of imaging data even while the subject is moving, providing motion-resolved parameter maps without breath holding or motion synchronization. We will scan healthy subjects, liver patients, prostate cancer patients, and cardiovascular patients to develop and validate this technology and use artificial intelligence to quickly reconstruct images from the collected data. The resulting tool will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to answer a wide range of biomedical questions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project is to develop and validate a one-stop, push-button solution for comprehensive, motion- resolved quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This will be accomplished by cultivating a new technology, MR Multitasking, which can measure multiple tissue biomarkers in a single scan, even in moving organs. The resulting technology will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to diagnose, monitor, and study a wide range of diseases.","Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking",9886248,R01EB028146,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Fibrosis', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Iron', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'body system', 'deep learning', 'heart motion', 'image reconstruction', 'magnetic field', 'magnetohydrodynamic', 'mathematical model', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'time use', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,628575,90419233,-0.021699811990930462
"Confocal video-mosaicking microscopy to guide surgery of superficially spreading skin cancers Superficially spreading types of skin cancers such as lentigo maligna melanomas (LMMs) and non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) occur mostly on older patients, with diffuse sub-clinical sub-surface spread over large areas and with poorly defined margins that are difficult to detect. To treat these cancers, dermatologists rou- tinely perform a large number of mapping biopsies to determine the spread and margins, followed by surgical excision with wide ""safety"" margins. Not surprisingly, such a ""blind"" approach results in under-sampling of the margins, over-sampling of normal skin, too many false positives and false negatives, and too much loss of normal skin tissue. What may help address this problem is reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging to noninvasively delineate margins, directly on patients. RCM imaging detects skin cancers in vivo with sensitivity of 85-95% and specificity 80-70%. In 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services granted reim- bursement codes for RCM imaging of skin. RCM imaging is now being increasingly used to noninvasively guide diagnosis, sparing patients from unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions. While the two-decade effort leading to the granting of these codes was focused on imaging-guided diagnosis, emerging applications are in imaging to guide therapy. We propose to create an approach called RCM video-mosaicking, to noninvasively map skin cancer margins over large areas on patients, with increased sampling, accuracy and sparing of nor- mal tissue. The innovation will be in designing a highly robust (against tissue warping and motion artifacts) and high speed (real-time, seconds) approach for RCM video-mosaicking: we will develop an optical flow ap- proach with a novel hybrid 3-stage deep learning network comprising of 8 parameters that will model global and local rigid and non-rigid tissue motion dynamics, learn and adapt to variable tissue and speckle noise con- ditions in patients, and predict and automatically detect motion blur artifacts. As required by PAR-18-009, our academic-industrial partnership will deliver RCM video-mosaicking to clinicians for real-time implementation at the bedside (translational novelty). Our proposed application is for guiding surgical excision, but the approach will have wider impact, for guiding new and emerging less invasive non-surgical treatments for superficial skin cancers. In a preliminary study, we demonstrated RCM video-mosaicking with real-time speed (125 millisec- onds per frame, 8 frames per second), and registration errors of 1.02 ± 1.3 pixels relative to field-of-view of 1000 x 1000 pixels. Our specific aims are (1) to develop a real-time and robust RCM video-mosaicking ap- proach and incorporate into a handheld confocal microscope for use at the bedside, (2) to test the approach for image quality and clinical acceptability, and (3) to prospectively test on 100 patients, with pre-surgical video- mosaicking of LMM margins and superficial NMSC margins, followed by validation against post-surgical pa- thology. We are a highly synergistic team from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Northeastern Uni- versity, and Caliber Imaging and Diagnostics (formerly, Lucid Inc.), with a 13-year record of collaboration. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging can noninvasively diagnose skin cancers, and spare patients from biopsies of benign skin conditions. We propose to develop an approach to noninvasively delineate skin cancer margins, to help guide less invasive surgery, and help more accurately and completely remove cancer while preserving more of the surrounding normal skin.",Confocal video-mosaicking microscopy to guide surgery of superficially spreading skin cancers,9951013,R01CA240771,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Dermatologist', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Excision', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Grant', 'Hutchinson&apos', 's Melanotic Freckle', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Skin Carcinoma', 'Skin Tissue', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Video Microscopy', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'blind', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'design', 'expectation', 'human imaging', 'image guided', 'image guided therapy', 'imaging approach', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning network', 'microscopic imaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'older patient', 'preservation', 'prospective test', 'reflectance confocal microscopy', 'response', 'vector']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2020,641884,185946435,-0.025974894509420473
"Shape up! Kids Project Summary/Abstract Of all markers of pediatric health, the most intuitive is body shape. Human and animal studies indicate that weight loss/gain correlates closely with increasing/decreasing insulin sensitivity, respectively. Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality risk than pediatric body mass index Z-score. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can quantify regional adiposity in more detail than these measures but is underutilized for many reasons including the sensitivity to children to ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments in optical technology to better describe phenotypes of pediatric body shape and its relation to metabolic risks (obesity, “failure to thrive”) and bone density and size. If successful, sophisticated obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment technology. The long term goal of the Shape Up! Kids Study is 1) to provide pediatric phenotype descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat) and bone mineral density (BMD) over a wide range of ages (5 to 18 years), weights and heights, stratified by sex, and ethnicity. Our central hypothesis is that optical estimates with shape classification of soft tissue composition and bone density better predict fracture and metabolic risk factors than anthropometry (WC, WHR, and BM) alone. The Investigators will highly leverage existing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Bone Mineral Density in Children Study. Our specific aims are: 1) Identify the unique associations of body shape to body composition and bone density indices in a pediatric population that represents the variance found in the US population, 2) Describe the precision and accuracy of optical scans to monitor change in body composition, bone density, 3) Estimate the level of association of optical scans to common health indicators including metabolic risk factors. Our exploratory aim is to investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self-assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US pediatric population, and to define how these models relate to important metabolic status indicators. The positive impact of these outcomes will be the immediate applicability to other researcher studies and clinicians using the automated tools and models developed here for 3D optical images. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of what children are at high risk of metabolic consequences of obesity. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults, and are becoming epidemic in children as well.

"Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus Abstract Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most serious manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Current clinical laboratory markers lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to optimize individual patient care creating a need to develop novel biomarkers for LN. To address this unmet need there has been a significant effort within the lupus research community to identify novel LN biomarkers, but to date none have been qualified for clinical use. We speculate that one of the important causes of these failures is that no single biomarker can account for the heterogeneity of SLE or LN. Under the hypothesis that multiple categories of biomarkers can represent different aspects of risk for LN, we propose to assess biomarkers that are classified into categories of disease susceptibility, systemic inflammation, and kidney compartment/cell injury to build models for risk prediction. Our objective is to develop composite biomarkers for early detection of renal flares, chronic renal damage, and treatment response of LN patients. To accomplish this goal we will use biospecimens from longitudinal observational cohorts and clinical trials that have well-annotated patient samples. The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) team therefore proposes to partner with the Ohio State University (OSU) team to combine each group's longitudinal SLE cohorts and create a well-phenotyped patient resource suited to biomarker discovery and large enough to adequately power validation studies. The combined OSU-MUSC cohort will have approximately 500 LN patients who have had rheumatology/nephrology clinic visits and biospecimens collected every two to six months for up to ten years. Using these samples, our collective team has already described several DNA, serum and urine biomarkers that are associated with disease activity, treatment response or organ damage in LN, and has considerable experience in developing biomarker panels for outcomes in LN. We have reviewed the last decade's literature, systematically ranked novel biomarkers, and propose to test the top performing LN biomarkers in this proposal to address whether: (i) Biomarkers associated with active LN can be used to predict impending renal flares in prospective longitudinal cohorts; (ii) Baseline measures of composite panels of urine or serum biomarkers can distinguish between who will and who will not achieve a renal response to one year of conventional therapy with mycophenolate mofetil; (iii) The development of genetic risk profiles of LN patients to identify those who are predisposed to develop chronic kidney damage. We will also compare biomarkers predictive of disease outcomes in LN to those in non-renal SLE, working towards developing LN specific vs general biomarker panels that are indicative of active inflammation and/or damage accrual. Our ultimate goal is to have validated LN predictors of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be clinically relevant, and that can be easily assayed in most clinical service laboratories to improve patient care. Relevance to Public Health Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic debilitating autoimmune disease that can lead to serious kidney damage and death. Given the high incidence of end stage kidney disease in minority women afflicted with lupus nephritis, it is essential to develop surrogate biomarkers to be able to predict impending disease flares, treatment response, and renal damage. The development of validated biomarker panels will pave the way towards better clinical management of patients who have lupus nephritis.",Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus,9925731,R01AR071947,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Services', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine clearance measurement', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Failure', 'Flare', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'In complete remission', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Lupus', 'Lupus Nephritis', 'Maintenance Therapy', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Nephrology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Probability', 'Proteinuria', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'South Carolina', 'Specificity', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vasculitis', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'conventional therapy', 'ds-DNA', 'early detection biomarkers', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'mycophenolate mofetil', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'renal damage', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'sex', 'therapy development', 'treatment response', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2020,653985,136810522,-0.013888747780843601
"Rapid Low-Cost Quantitative 3D MRI and Gait Assessment of the Knee Project Abstract Motivation: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful disease that affects tens of millions of Americans, but is poorly understood, resulting in a lack of treatments. Enabling low-cost approaches for widespread study of risk factors, onset and early progression of OA will enable better understanding of OA mechanisms, treatment development, and triage of patients to different treatments based on speciﬁc disease phenotypes. Multiple systemic factors, biochemical factors, and other risk factors are associated with OA, but causes are difﬁ- cult to isolate and study during slow progression. Currently OA is diagnosed as joint-space narrowing using X-ray radiography, at a stage well beyond when interventions can be effective. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of- fers sensitivity to morphologic and biochemical changes, but most methods are impractical for widespread clinical or research use. Usually MRI exams study only one knee, precluding the opportunity to compare knees. Sim- ilarly, biomechanics assessment typically requires numerous tests using advanced and rarely-available equip- ment and time-intensive analysis by skilled personnel, making this a challenge for widespread use. We have shown rapid, simultaneous 3D scanning of both knees with quantitative relaxometry and diffusion map- ping of connective tissues, combined with novel visualization of longitudinal change validated in a population with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. We have developed fully-automated cartilage and meniscus seg- mentation to simplify post-processing. (Our automated cartilage segmentation variability approaches that of reader-to-reader variability.) We now propose to combine MRI acquisition, reconstruction and analysis tech- niques with simple measures of kinematics into a widely applicable low-cost imaging and biomechanical test, which we will validate in subjects with ACL-injury and subjects with varying Kellgren-Lawrence grades of OA. Approach: We will begin by developing a robust 5-to-8-minute bilateral knee MRI exam, using an efﬁcient 3D isotropic acquisition and novel deep-learning based image reconstructions. This will be followed with automated cartilage segmentation and quantitative analysis (thickness, T2, diffusion) of all 3 knee plates and automated semiquantitative scoring approaches for synovitis, bone marrow and cartilage lesions. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) will be used to measure kinematics, and gait asymmetries. We will continue our studies in ACL pa- tients to validate techniques and to develop asymmetry analyses for both imaging and biomechanical measures. Finally, in subjects with varying OA grade, we will evaluate the potential of the overall low-cost approach to relate asymmetry and longitudinal change measures to progression and OA grade. Signiﬁcance: This project will develop an acquisition and analysis pipeline to quantify knee changes and left/right asymmetries that precede OA. We will characterize methods in idiopathic OA subjects and ACL- injured subjects at risk of post-traumatic OA. The very low target cost, under $120/subject, will ultimately enable widespread study of early onset and progression of different OA types, leading to earlier and better treatments. Project Narrative Osteoarthritis remains the leading cause of disability, and effective treatment will require efﬁcient assessment of disease risk-factors, onset, and progression, both for development and personalization of minimally invasive interventions. We propose a 5-minute 3D MRI exam of both knees without radiation or contrast injection, that will be combined with low-cost measures of knee motion and fully automated analysis methods to provide quan- titative measurements of cartilage, tendon, ligament, bone and ﬁbrocartilage health and asymmetries between knees. This low-cost, rapid, bilateral assessment will enable research studies in large populations, as well as adding quantitative bilateral information to clinical scans to dramatically improve understanding of onset of dif- ferent types of osteoarthritis.",Rapid Low-Cost Quantitative 3D MRI and Gait Assessment of the Knee,10032904,R01AR077604,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anterior Cruciate Ligament', 'Articulation', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Body mass index', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Spur', 'Cartilage', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Connective Tissue', 'Cost Measures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Fibrocartilages', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Gait abnormality', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammatory', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kellgren-Lawrence grade', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Left', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Ligaments', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Slice', 'Surface', 'Synovitis', 'Techniques', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Visualization', 'analysis pipeline', 'anterior cruciate ligament injury', 'anterior cruciate ligament rupture', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bone', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'gait examination', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'kinematics', 'learning classifier', 'meniscus injury', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'predictive test', 'primary outcome', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'sensor', 'societal costs', 'therapy development', 'tissue biomarkers']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,658342,560644462,-0.002108699861250319
"Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification Project Abstract Motivation: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 500 million people. Children commonly develop CKD from urinary obstructive diseases and nephrotoxic therapies, and then suffer severe growth failure,  hypertension, cardiovascular risks, and neurocognitive deficits, and eventually end-stage kidney disease. Accurate renal function quantification will improve clinical management of hydronephrosis (1 in 100 babies) and  dosing/selection of chemotherapeutic regimens in oncology patients. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the biomarker of renal function, is derived from blood or urine tests. These tests only provide global GFR and are limited in accuracy, especially in children, and even more so in children with cancer. MRI offers superb anatomic delineation without ionizing radiation, and is thus ideal for pediatric kidney imaging. However, MRI has not been widely adopted for pediatric renal function evaluation due to lack of reliability and cumbersome workflow. These hurdles stem from the fact that the critical components required for global and regional GFR calculation, including high spatiotemporal resolution, plasma flow and arterial input function, are difficult to obtain, and that accurate image segmentation of kidneys (cortex and medulla) is labor intensive. Additionally, although the same contrast agent injection can be used for obstruction evaluation, certain areas of the kidney suffer from significant signal loss using standard MRI acquisition techniques due to high contrast agent concentrations. This project addresses these major challenges for automated comprehensive renal function evaluation in children. Approach: The project has three development aims, which are validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable novel free-breathing time-resolved 3D dynamic contrast enhanced MRI that simultaneously provides accurate GFR calculation and renal plasma flow. This is achieved by incorporating self-navigated motion compensation, fast acquisition with parallel imaging and compressed sensing, and phase-contrast flow imaging. The second aim is to develop multiple new image analysis methods to extract GFR and renal plasma flow (RPF) that  leverage novel flow data of Aim 1, as well as automated new machine-learning image processing techniques for the segmentation of kidneys and ultimately global and regional GFR calculation. In Aim 3, we will develop and integrate ultrashort-echo-time techniques to address the MRI signal loss due to T2* effects from high contrast concentration for patients with obstruction, and further incorporate motion compensation and accelerated  imaging methods to enable time-resolved high-resolution dynamic MRI for contrast washout kinetics analysis in the same MR exam. Aim 4 will determine the performance of these methods in a clinical setting. Significance: This work will lead to robust, automated comprehensive pediatric renal MRI for safer and more accurate renal function evaluation in children. The techniques will facilitate widespread application in the com- munity setting and permit robust evaluation of renal function, for both children and adults. Project Narrative Kidney diseases in children often stem from blockages of the urinary tract or toxicity from medications, such as antibiotics or chemotherapies. Kidney function quantification is crucial for clinical management of these children. This work will develop accurate and automated pediatric MRI for quantification of kidney function and diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction.",Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification,9852445,R01EB026136,"['3-Dimensional', '4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac Output', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Cone', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Hydronephrosis', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Obstruction', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Reflux', 'Regimen', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Renal Plasma Flow', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Urinary tract', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Venous', 'Work', 'antimicrobial drug', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'community setting', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast enhanced', 'data acquisition', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'kidney cortex', 'kidney imaging', 'loss of function', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pressure', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem', 'urinary', 'urinary tract obstruction', 'urologic']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,662001,560644462,-0.0014474858871220974
"Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization Project Summary Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most diagnosed form of non-cutaneous cancer in US men. The selection of patients who require immediate treatment from those suitable for active surveillance currently relies on non- specific and inaccurate measurements. A method that allows clinicians to more confidently discriminate clinically relevant from non-life-threatening tumors is needed to improve patient management. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is the preferred non-invasive imaging modality for characterizing primary PCa. However, its accuracy for detecting clinically significant PCa is variable. We propose to address this limitation by combining mpMRI with positron emission tomography (PET) with a PCa-specific radiotracer and using advanced multimodal machine learning models (i.e. radiomics and deep learning) to characterize tumor aggressiveness based on the imaging data. Recently, scanners capable of simultaneous PET and MR data acquisition in human subjects have become commercially available. An integrated MR-PET scanner is the ideal tool for comparing MR and PET derived image features to identify those that provide complementary information and build a hybrid PET-mpMRI model that most accurately identifies clinically significant tumors. While this novel technology allows the acquisition of perfectly coregistered complementary anatomical, functional and metabolic data in a single imaging session, a new challenge needs to first be addressed to obtain quantitatively accurate PET data. In an integrated MR-PET scanner, the information needed for PET attenuation correction (AC) has to be derived from the MR data and the methods currently available for this task are inadequate for advanced quantitative studies. We have formed an academic-industrial partnership to accelerate the translation of multimodal MR-PET machine learning approaches into PCa research and clinical applications by addressing the AC challenge and validating machine learning models for detecting clinically significant disease against gold standard histopathology in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Specifically, we will: (1) Develop and validate an MR-based approach for obtaining quantitatively accurate PET data. We hypothesize that attenuation maps as accurate as those obtained using a 511 keV transmission source – the true gold standard for PET AC – will be obtained; (2) Identify the multimodal radiomics model that most accurately predicts PCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that the diagnostic accuracy of this approach will be superior to that offered by the stand-alone modalities; (3) Evaluate radiomics and deep learning approaches for predicting pPCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that machine learning approaches will achieve a higher predictive accuracy when applied to data acquired simultaneously than sequentially. Project narrative A better method to non-invasively characterize primary prostate cancer is needed to improve patient management. Extracting additional information from multimodality quantitative MR-PET data using machine learning approaches is expected to result in better diagnostic performance. In this work, we propose to accelerate the translation of quantitative MR-PET to prostate cancer research and clinical applications. In particular, we will develop and validate an MR-based attenuation correction approach to guarantee that quantitatively accurate PET data are obtained in an integrated MR-PET scanner and then use machine learning approaches to characterize the aggressiveness of the tumors in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.",Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization,9853761,R01CA218187,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Death Rates', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Histopathology', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kinetics', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'PSA level', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prostate', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone imaging', 'cancer classification', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'men', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'radiotracer', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tumor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,671823,551214295,-0.0854738995086018
"Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy Title: Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy ABSTRACT Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex, multifactorial, autoimmune disorder that affects ~1% of the worldwide population (~2 million adults in the US alone). It is characterized by chronic synovitis that, when left untreated, can result in irreversible joint destruction and deformity, leading to increased morbidity and all-cause mortality. The last three decades have witnessed impressive advances in the understanding of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic outcomes. In fact, the use of methotrexate first, and the subsequent incorporation of anti-TNF (TNFi) and other “biologics” have led to substantial improvements in RA clinical outcomes, enhancing the quality of life for millions of patients with inflammatory arthritis. Despite this progress, however, a significant question still remains unanswered: why do over 50% of RA patients with moderate to severe arthritis fail to respond appropriately to these agents? Pharmacomicrobiomics – an emerging field of study that investigates the effect of variations within the human gut microbiome on drugs – promises to overcome these barriers and facilitate precision medicine approaches in autoimmune disease.  Methotrexate (MTX), a dihydrofolate (DHF) reductase inhibitor, remains the anchor drug for the treatment of RA and is used widely throughout the world. While quite effective, oral MTX achieves significant results in less than 50% of patients and remission in only a quarter of them. It is well established that the inter-individual bioavailability of MTX is extremely variable, ranging from 10 to 80%. The reasons for this are presumably multifactorial. However, the intestinal microbiome and its enzymatic machinery are likely to play a significant role, based on our Preliminary Results and given that animals treated with antibiotics or kept under germ-free conditions show significant differences in MTX metabolism relative to control animals.  Our multidisciplinary team composed of rheumatologists, bioinformaticians, pharmacologists and microbiome researchers will address our overarching goal to study: a) if baseline intestinal microbiome, its genes, and associated metabolites can be used to predict the immunomodulatory responses to MTX in treatment-naïve, new-onset RA (NORA) patients; and b) if the gut microbiomes of MTX non-responders can be manipulated to modulate MTX metabolism and bioavailability. We believe that the results of our highly translational, innovative studies will directly influence therapeutic approaches for the treatment of RA and offer a more personalized approach in which the clinical efficacy response would be predicted early (and potentially improved by microbiome-targeted adjuvant therapies) in any given patient about to initiate MTX, limiting or preventing disease progression and ultimately avoiding wasteful health expenditures (estimated as ~$50,000/year/patient in direct costs). Importantly, we anticipate that our studies will establish generalizable approaches in rheumatology and autoimmunity that could be more broadly applied to the study and clinical maximization of other similar small molecules (e.g., JAK inhibitors) or even biologic agents (e.g., anti-TNF mAbs). NARRATIVE Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by widespread musculoskeletal inflammation affecting 1% of the world’s population (including ~2 million adults in the US alone). While the use of methotrexate (MTX) has significantly improved the lives of many people with RA, over 50% of patients do not respond adequately to this drug. Successful completion of our proposed studies will provide key insights into the effects of the gut bacteria on MTX and the implications for prediction of clinical response, ultimately identifying patients that are either likely to improve even before this treatment is prescribed, or those that would benefit from microbiome-targeted interventions to improve MTX absorption and efficacy.",Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy,9989043,R01AR074500,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Products', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biometry', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deformity', 'Diagnosis', 'Dihydrofolate Reductase Inhibitor', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Engraftment', 'Excess Mortality', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Free', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Role', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synovitis', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'absorption', 'arthritis therapy', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'chronic autoimmune disease', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'drug disposition', 'drug metabolism', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'germ free condition', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'joint destruction', 'joint injury', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome components', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'polyglutamates', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'rRNA Genes', 'recruit', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'rheumatologist', 'sample collection', 'small molecule', 'therapy outcome']",NIAMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,677759,329565273,-0.017055717292612935
"Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Although cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are relatively rare causes of heart failure (HF), they are particularly challenging to detect and treat for several shared reasons: (1) on routine clinical imaging (i.e., echocardiography [echo]), they can be difficult to distinguish from superficially similar, more common forms of cardiac disease that cause left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy; (2) the diagnoses are often missed and thus patients can present late in the course of disease at a time when treatment is difficult; (3) objective, noninvasive metrics that reliably reflect disease progression have not been identified; and (4) the small number of known patients with these diseases can make epidemiology studies and clinical trials difficult to organize and conduct. For both cardiac amyloidosis and HCM, echo plays a critical role in both diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring given its ubiquitous clinical availability, safety, and low cost. More broadly, echo dominates the current landscape of routine cardiac imaging, with tens of millions of echos performed in the United States each year. However, the clinical challenges described above highlight several shortcomings of echo: it is limited in its ability to (1) diagnose disease at its early stages; (2) discriminate between morphologically similar diseases; and (3) quantify disease progression. This proposal seeks to address deficiencies in the current echo reading workflow, which is subjective and captures only a small fraction of the data available in each study. The overall objective of this application is to use advances in machine learning to develop and validate fully-automated echo image analytic approaches to diagnose and track rare cardiomyopathies, focusing on cardiac amyloidosis and HCM. Our proposal is centered on the hypothesis that highly scalable computer vision methods can be applied to echo studies to overcome limitations of the standard clinical echo reading workflow. Accordingly our aims are: (1) Apply an automated method for echo quantification and disease identification to detect and differentiate cardiac diseases that cause increased LV wall thickness; and (2) Characterize quantifiable echo measures of disease progression in cardiac amyloidosis and HCM and associate these with clinical outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team, which is composed of experts in cardiomyopathies, echocardiography, computer vision, and machine learning, will analyze echos and patient data from 2 large patient registries: the Multicenter Amyloid Phenotyping Study (MAPS) and the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) HCM Network, with validation using a repository of nearly 400,000 echos. The successful completion of our aims will result in an innovative tool for early diagnosis of myocardial diseases and tracking of disease progression. Importantly, our project will set the stage for conducting larger epidemiology studies of rare myocardial diseases by automating the identification of these patients, and thereby developing previously unattainable broad-based cohorts for these conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis (due to abnormal deposition of a protein into the heart muscle) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to a genetic mutation) are important causes of heart failure and sudden death in the general population. These heart diseases are difficult to diagnose, monitor, and treat because: (1) they appear superficially similar to more common forms of heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure) on imaging tests; (2) the optimal monitoring of disease progression over time has not been established; and (3) there is a lack of large-scale studies of patients with these diseases given their rarity. This project aims to use machine learning (artificial intelligence) of digital echocardiographic images to create a completely automated method for diagnosing and tracking these rare heart diseases with the ultimate goal of broad deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms in hospitals and clinics to help identify patients with these rare heart diseases earlier, better predict adverse outcomes, and increase the size and scope of patient registries to enhance research of these conditions.",Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases,9739345,R01HL140731,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloidosis', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Face', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Inherited', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Two-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'adverse outcome', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'digital', 'disease diagnosis', 'epidemiology study', 'heart imaging', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'particle', 'patient registry', 'repository', 'response', 'statistical learning', 'tool']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,687210,327644200,0.01597419283032129
"Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) PROJECT SUMMARY Cerebral cavernous angioma (CA) is a capillary microangiopathy affecting more than a million Americans, predisposing them to a premature risk of brain hemorrhage. Fewer than 200,000 cases who have suffered a recent symptomatic hemorrhage (SH) are most likely to re-bleed again with serious clinical sequelae, and are the primary focus of therapeutic development. Genetic mechanisms of CA have been extensively studied, and consequent signaling aberrations in the neurovascular unit. These include proliferative dysangiogenesis, blood- brain barrier hyperpermeability, inflammation and immune mediated processes, anticoagulant vascular domain, and gut microbiome-driven mechanisms. Plasma levels of molecules reflecting these mechanisms and measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage leak on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been correlated with CA hemorrhage in pilot studies. It would be desirable to optimize these biomarkers to accurately diagnose CASH, to prognosticate the risk of future SH, and to monitor cases after a bleed and in response to therapy. This would influence clinical management, and select higher risk cases for clinical trials. Additional candidate biomarkers are emerging from ongoing mechanistic and differential transcriptome studies, which would be expected to further enhance the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis and prediction of CASH. Weighed combinations of levels of plasma proteins and characteristic micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNA) may further strengthen biomarker associations. Plasma biomarkers may reflect (and potentially replace) more cumbersome and expensive imaging biomarkers for monitoring CA hemorrhage. We here assemble leading clinical CA researchers and propose to deploy advanced statistical and computational biology approaches (including supervised machine learning) for the integration of novel candidate biomarkers, rejecting non-correlated candidates, and determining the best clustering and weighing of combined biomarker contributions. In Specific Aim 1 we assess these biomarkers in a large CA cohort from multiple sites, to discover the best plasma biomarkers and validate them in sex, age and relevant clinical subgroups. In Specific Aim 2 we compare changes in MRI measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage with plasma biomarkers over time. In Specific Aim 3 we query the biomarkers in non-CA subjects, to identify potential confounders in the clinical context. This project leverages the synergy of established CA research consortia, and integrates analytic and computational biology expertise to develop blood tests for better CASH diagnosis and prognosis. The project tests a novel integrational approach of biomarker development in a mechanistically defined cerebrovascular disease with a relevant context of use. This approach is applicable to other neurological diseases with similar pathobiologic features.

"Noninvasive Testing of Coronary Microvascular Reactivity Using High-resolution Free-breathing MRI PROJECT SUMMARY It was long taken for granted that obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is the primary driver of angina and major adverse cardiac events. However, recent landmark studies have shown that up to 50% of the patients referred for diagnostic testing have ischemia with no obstructive CAD (INOCA). A large proportion of INOCA patients have coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), which even in the absence of flow-limiting stenoses can lead to myocardial ischemia and carries a high risk of adverse events. The reference standard for assessment of CMD is the functional coronary reactivity (CR) test, which is invasive. Despite key studies showing value of stratifying therapy based on CR testing, the practical utility of CR testing in the INOCA population is limited by its invasive nature, which carries serious risks even at experienced centers. Hence, a noninvasive approach that can detect and stage the severity of CMD would be invaluable for managing INOCA patients. Driven by this unmet need, prior studies have employed imaging approaches to index myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) against CR; however, the association shown to date between MPR and CR impairment has been weak, likely due to the suboptimal sensitivity of MPR to subendocardial myocardial blood flow (MBF) deficits which is a hallmark of CMD. Studies using invasive microsphere-based methods have established a stress subendocardial-to-subepicardial (endo-epi) MBF gradient of larger than 1.0 in healthy animals, and shown that it decreases well below 1 under abnormally elevated microvascular resistance. However, noninvasive detection of endo-epi MBF gradients using existing imaging strategies is challenging because of the need to resolve MBF transmurally. We have developed new MRI strategies aimed at overcoming key barriers for accurate evaluation of endo-epi MBF gradients and applied them in preliminary animal and patient studies. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that in the setting of CMD, impaired microvascular CR manifests as a stress-induced endo- epi MBF gradient, and the magnitude of this gradient significantly correlates with CMD severity. To test this hypothesis, we propose 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a free-breathing artifact-free MRI technique optimized for high-resolution imaging of endo-epi MBF gradients, combined with a machine learning approach for fully-automated objective quantification of MBF gradients. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity can be staged on the basis of MRI-derived stress MBF gradient in a pig model of CMD. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity in INOCA patients is highly correlated with MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. This project brings together multiple interdisciplinary investigators with a strong collective track record in developing cardiac imaging strategies to advance a noninvasive approach for determining CMD severity based on the MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. Hence the proposal is a major step towards improving the management of INOCA patients and towards imaging-guided evaluation of novel therapies aimed at CMD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent landmark studies have provided evidence that “small vessel” coronary dysfunction in patients with otherwise normal coronary arteries is a major cause of heart disease and can lead to poor health outcomes including heart failure. This research proposal seeks to develop a noninvasive approach for diagnosis and monitoring of small-vessel coronary dysfunction by developing innovative and reliable magnetic resonance imaging strategies. Our proposal has the potential to improve patient care in this population by providing a noninvasive alternative to the established invasive testing procedure, which carries a risk of complications and is only available at highly specialized medical centers.",Noninvasive Testing of Coronary Microvascular Reactivity Using High-resolution Free-breathing MRI,10037606,R01HL153430,"['Animals', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Echocardiography', 'Endothelium', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family suidae', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertrophy', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microspheres', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Nature', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Systole', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Vasodilator Agents', 'adverse event risk', 'base', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'perfusion imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'recruit', 'sequence learning']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,699398,90419233,-0.010718610622502808
"Machine learning for fast motion compensated quantitative abdominal DCE-MRI Project Summary: Functional imaging with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) provides important physiological markers of permeability, perfusion and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), a measure of kidney function, without exposing patients to ionizing radiation. DCE-MR images are at the same time used for evaluation of anatomy. Functional markers from DCE-MRI, if computed accurately, would play a critical role in diagnosing and assessing the progression of a number of pediatric diseases including those compromising kidney function, liver diseases, tumors, and Crohn's disease. One of the most important applications of DCE-MRI is assessing kidney function (GFR) in hydronephrosis patients with obstruction. In the absence of GFR information, children who stand to benefit from immediate surgical reconstruction might be overlooked or delayed in receiving treatment, and those who might benefit from a more conservative approach (i.e., “watchful waiting”) might receive an unnecessary surgical intervention. While the current reference standard, nuclear renography (MAG3), yields some useful diagnostic information, it is slow, provides low resolution, does not offer anatomic detail, and delivers potentially harmful ionizing radiation. There is a clinical need for accurate computation of quantitative functional markers. Unfortunately, current methods of DCE-MRI in neonates and children are less than optimal, and therefore, DCE-MRI is underutilized in clinical practice. The technical challenges include insufficient temporal resolution to capture fast arterial input function (AIF) dynamics (which are required for accurate computation of quantitative markers), unavoidable respiratory motion and bulk motion (which reduce image quality and significantly lower the accuracy of parameter estimates), and a lack of robust, fast, automated post processing techniques for accurate computation of markers. Thus, there is an urgent, unmet need to develop a motion-compensated, high spatiotemporal resolution DCE-MRI method addressing these challenges. The primary objective of this exploratory, three-year study, is three-fold: first, to develop and evaluate a new bulk and respiratory motion-compensated, high spatiotemporal resolution DCE-MRI technique for accurate estimation of functional markers; second, to further improve the robustness and speed of DCE-MRI using a fast, deep learning (DL) technique with integrated temporal prior for the reconstruction of motion-compensated, higher quality, high temporal resolution images; and third, to develop an automatic quantitative analysis pipeline including segmentation and tracer kinetic model-fitting using DL techniques for fast, robust and accurate quantification of functional markers. The successful completion of these aims will provide new, clinically important abdominal imaging capabilities, with real-time, motion-compensated image reconstruction and reliable real-time parameter estimation from high temporal and spatial resolution DCE-MRI. This work will extend the usefulness of DCE-MRI to pediatric patients who are unable to remain still in the scanner, and eliminate the need for repeated scans and sedation in infants. ! !

"Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering myocardial infarction (heart attacks) have no premonitory symptoms. Studies of patients with coronary artery disease have traditionally focused only on the severity of narrowing (stenosis) of the coronary arteries by atherosclerotic plaques, rather than the adverse features of coronary plaques which are predisposed to rupture and precipitate myocardial infarction. Coronary CT Angiography (CTA) is a noninvasive test that allows assessment of both coronary stenosis and plaque characteristics. Currently, however, CTA is interpreted visually for stenosis. Quantitative measurements of CTA stenosis severity and plaque features are not part of current clinical routine.  We propose to develop novel image processing algorithms for fully automated, robust quantification of coronary plaque features from CTA. We also propose to automatically quantify the characteristics of adipose tissue around the coronary arteries (pericoronary adipose tissue, PCAT), which have been shown to differentiate rupture-prone, high-risk coronary plaques from stable ones. We propose to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine stenosis, plaque and PCAT features, along with patient clinical data, into a new integrated risk score for the prediction of future adverse cardiovascular events. We will evaluate this risk score in the real-world, prospective, landmark SCOT-HEART trial (including all 2073 patients in the CTA arm of the trial), with added external validation in large multicenter patient registries, with available CTA scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiovascular events (fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death in a grand total of 7844 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To refine, expand and automate measurements of coronary plaque and lumen for the entire coronary artery tree, and to standardize measurement of plaque changes in serial CTA; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified plaque features and PCAT characteristics for the prediction of future MACE in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries; 3) To develop and evaluate with full external validation a new automated patient risk score—combining patient clinical data, CTA-measured quantitative plaque features and PCAT characteristics, using machine learning—for the prediction of future MACE events in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries.  The proposed work will enable automated, multi-faceted and reproducible analysis of plaque, stenosis and PCAT from CTA, combined with objective risk scores reflecting likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events. This work will provide a novel, personalized, real-world paradigm that objectively and accurately identifies individual patients at risk of future cardiovascular events, from routine CTA imaging. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) In patients who are at risk of developing a heart attack, imaging of the heart with coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) allows doctors to noninvasively assess the narrowing of the coronary arteries caused by coronary plaque deposits, as well as the coronary plaques themselves. The researchers propose to develop and validate novel computerized scores derived from real-world CTA and clinical patient data using artificial intelligence, that will automatically identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack or cardiovascular death. This new research will allow physicians to more precisely identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to reduce their risk of future adverse cardiovascular events.",Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography,9981397,R01HL148787,"['Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Event', 'Future', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'arm', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinically significant', 'computerized', 'coronary calcium scoring', 'coronary computed tomography angiography', 'coronary event', 'coronary plaque', 'density', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient registry', 'prognostic significance', 'prognostic value', 'prospective']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,714763,90419233,-0.009107894089515702
"Mobilize Center: Models for Mobile Sensing and Precision Rehabilitation Limited mobility due to conditions like osteoarthritis (OA), cerebral palsy, and Parkinson’s disease affects millions of individuals, at enormous personal and societal cost. Rehabilitation can dramatically improve mobility and function, but current rehabilitation practice requires in-person guidance by a skilled clinician, increasing expense and limiting access. Mobile sensing technologies are now ubiquitous and have the potential to measure patient function and guide treatment outside the clinic, but they currently fail to capture the characteristics of motion required to accurately monitor function and customize treatment. Millions of low-cost mobile sensors are generating terabytes of data that could be analyzed in combination with other data, such as images, clinical records, and video, to enable studies of unprecedented scale, but machine learning models for analyzing these large-scale, heterogeneous, time-varying data are lacking.  To address these challenges, we will establish a Biomedical Technology Resource Center —The Mobilize Center. Through the leadership of an experienced scientific team, we will create and disseminate innovative tools to quantify movement biomechanics with mobile sensors.  Specifically, we will:  1. Push the bounds of what we can measure via wearable sensors using models that compute muscle  and joint forces and metabolic cost of locomotion. These models, based on biomechanical and machine  learning models, will be disseminated via our newly created OpenSense software, which will be used  by thousands of researchers to gain new insights into patient biomechanics using mobile sensors.  2. Meet the need for tools that analyze data about movement dynamics and develop machine learning  models to analyze and generate insights from unstructured, high-dimensional data, including time-  series (e.g., from mobile sensors), images (e.g., MRI), and video (e.g., smartphone video of a patient’s gait).  3. Provide tools needed to intervene in the real-world. We will develop algorithms to accurately quantify  kinematics outside the lab for long durations using data from inertial measurement units (IMUs). We will  also build behavioral models to adapt and personalize goal setting, drawing on movement records from  6 million individuals, as well as health goals and exercise for 1.7 million people.  Through intensive interactions with our Collaborative Projects, we will focus on improving rehabilitation outcomes for individuals with limited mobility due to osteoarthritis, obesity, Parkinson’s disease, and cerebral palsy. The Center’s tools and services will enable researchers to revolutionize how we diagnose, monitor, and treat mobility disorders, providing tools needed to deliver precision rehabilitation at low cost and on a massive scale in the future. Limited mobility due to conditions like osteoarthritis, cerebral palsy, and Parkinson’s affects millions of individuals, at a great cost to public health and personal well-being.

"Clinical and genetic analysis of retinopathy of prematurity Project Summary The long-term goal of this project is to establish a quantitative framework for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) care based on clinical, imaging, genetic, and informatics principles. In the previous grant period, we have developed artificial intelligence methods for ROP diagnosis, but real-world adoption has been limited by lack of prospective validation and by perception of these systems as “black boxes” that do not explain their rationale for diagnosis. Furthermore, although biomedical research data are being generated at an enormous pace, much less work has been done to integrate disparate scientific findings across the spectrum from genomics to imaging to clinical medicine. This renewal will address current gaps in knowledge in these areas. Our overall hypotheses are that developing a quantitative framework for ROP care using artificial intelligence and analytics will improve clinical disease management, that building “explainable” artificial intelligence systems will enhance clinical acceptance and educational opportunities, and that analysis of relationships among clinical, imaging, environmental, and genetic findings, in ROP will improve understanding of disease pathogenesis and risk. These hypotheses will be tested using three Specific Aims: (1) Evaluation performance of an artificial intelligence system for ROP diagnosis and screening prospectively. This will include: (a) recruit a target of over 2000 eye exams including wide-angle retinal images from 375 subjects at 5 centers, (b) optimize an image quality detection algorithm we have recently developed, and (c) analyze system accuracy for ROP diagnosis and screening (using a novel quantitative vascular severity scale). (2) Improve the interpretability of our existing artificial intelligence methods for ROP diagnosis. This will include: (a) increase “explainability” of systems by combining deep learning with traditional feature extraction methods, (b) develop neural networks to identify changes between serial images, and (c) evaluate these methods through systematic feedback by experts. (3) Develop integrated models for ROP pathogenesis and risk. This will include: (a) build and improve ROP risk prediction models based on clinical, image, and demographic features, and (b) integrate genetic, imaging, clinical, and environmental variables through genetic risk prediction by machine learning, by investigating casual relationships with genetic variants and genetic risk scores, and by incorporating SNP associations with gene expression measurements to identify functional genes of ROP. Ultimately, these studies will significantly reduce barriers to adoption of technologies such as artificial intelligence for clinicians, and will demonstrate a prototype for health information management which combines genotypic and phenotypic data. This project will be performed by a multi-disciplinary team of investigators who have worked successfully together for nearly 10 years, and who have expertise in ophthalmology, biomedical informatics, computer science, computational biology, ophthalmic genetics, genetic analysis, and statistical genetics. Project Narrative ROP is a leading cause of childhood blindness in the US and throughout the world, and the number of infants at risk for disease is increasing as the rate of premature birth rises. Rapidly-progressive changes associated with retinal vascular development may be visualized by clinical examination, captured by wide-angle imaging, and analyzed genetically. This project will develop, enhance, and validate artificial intelligence and analytic tools to help clinicians identify infants at risk for severe ROP using image analysis, genetic analysis, and integrative informatics that combines these factors – while also providing insight about disease pathogenesis.",Clinical and genetic analysis of retinopathy of prematurity,9974137,R01EY019474,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infant', 'Informatics', 'Information Management', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Measurement', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Network-based', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmology', 'Other Genetics', 'Oxygen', 'Paper', 'Pathogenesis', 'Peer Review', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care delivery', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical examination', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'data access', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'disorder risk', 'feature extraction', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'high risk', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'insight', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data types', 'neovascular', 'neural network', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'real world application', 'recruit', 'retinal imaging', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'serial imaging']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,764279,304670088,-0.019730130443496294
"An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objective of this project is to create an unobtrusive, wrist-worn, cuff-less blood pressure monitor for measurement and identification of nocturnal nondipping hypertension. The investigation includes extensive validation with state-of-the-art ambulatory blood pressure monitors at nighttime in presence of heterogeneous treatment paradigms. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the major causes of ailments worldwide. Hypertension alone affects one in three adults according to the World Health Organization. Therefore, monitoring blood pressure has become a critical part of healthcare as it is known to be linked to many CVDs. Traditionally, clinical practitioners have relied on the mercury-based (or digital equivalent) inflatable cuff-based sphygmomanometer. However, the nature of the device allows for only infrequent measurements and its somewhat invasive nature and associated discomfort prohibits additional nocturnal measurements. There is certainly a value to measuring blood pressure continuously in the natural context of the user’s environment, in particular during sleep, without being disturbed by the instrument. Our proposed technology can provide a wealth of information to physicians, help identify certain short-term dynamics/variations of blood pressure, and allow effective monitoring of response to medication, among other things. Nocturnal measurements provide additional prognostic value in identifying risk. Despite these benefits, no wearable, non-invasive device for continuous blood pressure monitoring exists on the market simply because none have been reliable enough to be considered clinical grade. This project aims to develop a robust and reliable blood pressure monitor in the form of a wrist-worn device that uses bio-impedance sensors, and for the first time, demonstrate clinical grade reliability. These sensors measure pulse wave velocity (PWV) along with several other derivatives for cardiovascular parameters including heart rate and blood volume changes in arteries, which correlate with the blood pressure. The system will incorporate clever hardware design to localize underlying vasculature and focus on arterial sites for enhanced accuracy. The device will include a motion sensor to take into account the user’s movements and motion artifacts, the contact quality, and reliability of the measurements. Advanced machine learning techniques, leveraging both general and personalized models, will be developed to convert bio-impedance measurements to blood pressure. This project aims to then validate the system and analytics in both a healthy patient cohort and a hypertensive cohort, learning the impact that nocturnal ‘nondipping’ hypertension and anti-hypertensive treatments have on PWV/other cardiovascular correlates and blood pressure estimates. After decades of relying on the inflatable cuff- based technique, this system could represent a significant change in how we measure blood pressure. PROJECT NARRATIVE Continuous monitoring of nocturnal blood pressure can help early diagnosis of developing cardiac conditions, reveal short term blood pressure variations, and also help the physician monitor differences in variations in response to medication for hypertensive patients. Moreover, the comfort and convenience of a wearable monitor would allow measurement in the natural context of daily life, including important nocturnal measurements, and reduce the burden of adherence on the user. The system will also provide feedback on quality of measurements to allow the users or care-givers to gauge reliability.",An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension,9998433,R01HL151240,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Arteries', 'Awareness', 'Biometry', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Calibration', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mercury', 'Methods', 'Microfabrication', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proxy', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sphygmomanometers', 'Structural Models', 'Supine Position', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Wrist', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical method', 'arterial stiffness', 'base', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'digital', 'effectiveness validation', 'electric impedance', 'insight', 'instrument', 'model development', 'monitoring device', 'motion sensor', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'performance tests', 'prognostic value', 'response', 'sensor', 'sex', 'sleep position', 'supine sleep', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'willingness']",NHLBI,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R01,2020,766675,6384662,-0.002984932857053877
"Improving Pediatric SPECT Imaging: Enhanced Lesion Detection with Dose Reduction through Advanced Reconstruction and Motion Correction Nuclear medicine imaging in children has been shown to have significant clinical value across all organ systems. In providing this significant benefit it is critical to minimize the radiation dose used in pediatric patients, whose risk for adverse health effects (such as cancer) per unit administered activity is much higher than that of adults, owing to their higher tissue sensitivity and longer potential lifespan. The governing principle of this project will be to minimize radiation dose while methodically ensuring that lesion detection performance is fully preserved. This will be accomplished by using validations based on both numerical and physician observers measuring performance in tasks that emulate those performed clinically. We will employ two approaches in tandem to enable lowering dose while maintaining performance. First, we will use advanced image reconstruction and processing techniques. Corrections for various forms of image quality degradation will be incorporated in the reconstruction, and deep learning (DL) will be used for post-reconstruction denoising. Second, we will develop methods to correct for both body and respiratory motion, which degrade diagnostic accuracy. Correcting for body and respiratory motion will allow dose to be reduced without loss of image quality and will also offer a technological alternative to using sedation or even general anesthesia to minimize motion when imaging children. For this investigation we have selected 99mTc-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal imaging as a testbed to demonstrate our approaches. Damage to the renal cortex resulting from infection of the kidneys is a critical issue in children, including newborns and toddlers. DMSA SPECT is the “gold-standard” in the evaluation of pyelonephritis and renal scarring post- infection. The concepts we will demonstrate for reduction of radiation dose and correction of motion with DMSA will be translatable to other SPECT (and PET) studies in pediatric imaging and beyond.  Our Specific Aims are: 1. Establish infrastructure for investigating and evaluating advanced reconstruction and motion correction; 2. Determine the extent of radiation dose reduction to pediatric patients through improved reconstruction and DL denoising while maintaining optimal full-dose lesion detection accuracy; 3. Develop data-driven and depth-sensing camera methods for body and respiratory motion estimation and correction; and 4. Conduct numerical and physician observer studies to validate the level of dose reduction enabled by DL denoising and motion correction. Narrative  In nuclear medicine imaging, it is critical to minimize the radiation dose used in pediatric patients, whose risk for adverse health effects (such as cancer) per unit administered activity is much higher than that in adults, owing to their higher tissue sensitivity and longer potential lifespan. Correcting for body and respiratory motion occurring during imaging will improve the quality of the formed three-dimensional images of the patient by reducing blurring and image artifacts and offer a technological alternative to using sedation or even general anesthesia to reduce motion when imaging children, which can bear health risks of its own. We propose an advanced reconstruction methodology which would enable reduction in the amount of activity administered and compensate for patient motion during imaging.",Improving Pediatric SPECT Imaging: Enhanced Lesion Detection with Dose Reduction through Advanced Reconstruction and Motion Correction,9914572,R01EB029315,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'DMSA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Freedom', 'Gaussian model', 'General Anesthesia', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Longevity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Newborn Infant', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Pyelonephritis', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Scheme', 'Sedation procedure', 'Societies', 'Statistical Study', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toddler', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'base', 'body system', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'denoising deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kidney cortex', 'kidney infection', 'molecular imaging', 'pediatric patients', 'preservation', 'reconstruction', 'renal scarring', 'respiratory', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2020,773763,294146927,0.0012680172026859476
"Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder, affecting 2 million Americans in whom it may cause skipped heart beats, dizziness or stroke. Unfortunately, therapy for AF has limited success, likely because AF represents heterogenous and poorly characterized disease entities between individuals. A central challenge is that it is not clear why a specific therapy works in a given AF patient. This uncertainty makes it challenging to develop a patient-specific approach to tailor therapy for personalized medicine.  The premise of this project is that mechanistic data is increasingly available in AF patients at scales spanning tissue, whole heart and patient levels, yet rarely integrated. We set out to use machine learning (ML), a powerful approach proven to classify complex datasets, to integrate data to address 3 clinical unmet needs. First, electrograms are rarely used to guide therapy in AF, unlike organized rhythms, because they are difficult to interpret. Second, it is difficult to understand how arrhythmia is affected by any specific ablation strategy in AF, unlike organized rhythms. This makes it difficult to improve therapy. Third, it is difficult to identify whether an individual patient will or will not have success from AF ablation. We applied machine learning and novel objective analyses to these questions to develop strategies for personalized AF therapy.  We have 3 specific aims: (1) To identify components of AF electrograms using ML trained to monophasic action potentials (MAP); (2) To identify electrical and structural features of the acute response of AF to ablation near and remote from PVs; (3) To identify patients in whom ablation is unsuccessful or successful long-term, who are poorly separated at present. Each Aim will compare ML to traditional biostatistics, and use objective explainability analysis of ML to provide mechanistic insights.  This study has potential to deliver immediate clinical and translational impact. We will apply specific ML approaches, biostatistics, and computer modeling to our rich multiscale registry. We will develop practical and shareable tools, which we will prospectively test clinically, to deliver meaningful outcomes at tissue, whole heart and patient scales. Our team is experienced in electrophysiology, computer science, signal processing and biological physics. This project is likely to reveal novel multiscale AF phenotypes to enable personalized therapy. Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation Narrative Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an enormous public health problem that affects 2-5 million Americans, causing stroke, rapid heart beats, heart failure and even death. In this project, the applicant will apply numerical analysis and machine learning to detailed data acquired from patients undergoing therapy, to better define individual biological types of AF, which may provide a foundation for personalized patient-tailored diagnosis and therapy.",Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation,9995302,R01HL149134,"['Ablation', 'Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dizziness', 'Drug Controls', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'demographics', 'digital', 'experience', 'heart rhythm', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized strategies', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'response', 'signal processing', 'success', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'voice recognition', 'voltage']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,785591,560644462,-0.05172454318412116
"Optimization of diagnostic accuracy, radiation dose, and patient throughput for cardiac SPECT via advanced and clinically practical cardiac-respiratory motion correction and deep learning Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is widely used to detect and evaluate coronary artery disease. The goal of this project is to reduce the radiation dose and/or scan time of SPECT MPI by a combined factor of 16x, while maintaining or increasing diagnostic accuracy. This would enable SPECT MPI to be performed, e.g., with 4x reduced radiation dose and 4x shorter scan time (~2.5 minutes) than typical protocols. Radiation dose in SPECT MPI has been recognized as an important issue, accounting for ~25% of all radiation exposure to patients in medical imaging. Dose reduction particularly addresses the increased prevalence of obese patients (who receive higher dose) and younger cardiac patients (whose radiation risk is higher due to longer life expectancy). Reduction in scan time would improve comfort for elderly and infirm cardiac patients, while mitigating body-motion image artifacts and reducing healthcare costs by increasing clinical throughput. We will reduce dose and scan time through innovative image reconstruction methods that involve little or no cost and require no additional patient setup steps. We will employ new respiratory and cardiac motion compensation to reduce image artifacts, as well as new deep learning techniques, which will be used for both respiratory-signal estimation and high-performance denoising. We will methodically optimize these techniques and then validate our algorithms in multicenter clinical reader studies. SA1: Develop clinically practical respiratory motion surrogates for low-count studies. T1: Perfect data- driven respiratory surrogate estimation; T2: Optimize data-driven surrogate estimation at reduced counts; T3: Develop and clinically validate depth-sensing cameras for respiratory and body-motion surrogate estimation; T4: Generalization of data-driven surrogate estimation to SPECT systems not having a CT. SA2: Develop deep-learning reconstruction methods and optimize for diagnostic accuracy and dose/scan time. T1: Post-reconstruction DL denoising algorithms for 3D perfusion images for reduced-count and standard- count studies; T2: DL denoising algorithms for 4D cardiac-gated studies; T3: 4D reconstruction with embedded DL denoising, cardiac motion estimation and correction; and T4: DL reconstruction methods with both RMC and CMC, with projection data binned using respiratory surrogate signals derived in SA1. SA3: Perform multicenter clinical reader studies (6 clinicians, 3 institutions) to validate the new algorithms and compare to current clinically-available methods based on diagnostic performance and repeatability in assessing both perfusion and wall motion defects. T1: In comparison to baseline clinical reconstruction, evaluate added benefit of: a) including attenuation and scatter correction, and b) additionally including RMC; T2: Validate DL for improvement of perfusion and function (wall motion) task performance at full-count levels; and T3: Validate DL for improvement of task performance at reduced counts. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project we will employ new methods of image reconstruction and processing to reduce radiation dose and scan time in cardiac SPECT imaging, which is used 15-20 million times per year to evaluate coronary artery disease. Dose reduction is important because cardiac SPECT accounts for ~25% of all radiation exposure to the public due to medical imaging; reducing scan time would make SPECT more comfortable for elderly and infirm cardiac patients, while mitigating image artifacts, as well as and reducing healthcare costs by allowing more patients to be scanned per day. Our goal will be to achieve a combined 16x reduction in dose and scan time while maintaining or improving diagnostic accuracy, thereby permitting a 4x reduction in dose while reducing scan time from ~10 minutes to ~2.5 minutes.","Optimization of diagnostic accuracy, radiation dose, and patient throughput for cardiac SPECT via advanced and clinically practical cardiac-respiratory motion correction and deep learning",10072432,R01HL154687,"['3-Dimensional', '4D Imaging', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Advocate', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Cardiac', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Exposure to', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Institution', 'Left Ventricular Function', 'Life Expectancy', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'denoising deep learning', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'heart motion', 'hemodynamics', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'perfusion imaging', 'preservation', 'prognostic', 'quantum', 'radiation risk', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'tool', 'visual tracking']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,786840,8894636,0.0012695547400010999
"q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy Project Summary/Abstract  Ischemic heart disease remains the top cause of death in the world. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) causes regional dysfunction which places remote areas of the heart at a mechanical disadvantage resulting in long term adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling and complicating congestive heart failure (CHF). The course of MI and post-MI remodeling is complex and includes vascular and myocellular injury, acute and chronic inflammation, alterations of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and angiogenesis. Stress echocardiography is a clinically established, cost-effective technique for detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease and myocardial injury by imaging the LV at rest and after either exercise or pharmacologically-induced stress to reveal ischemia and/or scar. In our previous effort on this project, we developed quantitative 3D differential deformation measures for stress echocardiography from 4DE-derived LV strain maps taken at rest and after dobutamine stress. These measures can localize and quantify the extent and severity of LV myocardial injury and reveal ischemic regions. We now propose that improved versions of these same measures can be used for both targeting of therapy and outcomes assessment in the treatment of adverse local myocardial remodeling following MI. We choose a particular up and coming therapeutic strategy as an exemplar: the local delivery of injectable hydrogels within the MI region that are intended to alter the biomechanical properties of the LV myocardium, as well as inflammation, and thereby help to minimize adverse remodeling. Our new, robust approach for estimating improved dense displacement and differential deformation measures is based on an innovative data-driven, deep feed-forward, neural network architecture that employs domain adaptation between data from labeled, carefully-constructed synthetic models of physiology and echocardiographic image formation (i.e. with ground truth), and data from unlabeled noisy in vivo porcine or human echocardiography (missing or very limited ground truth). Training is based on tens of thousands of four-dimensional (4D) image-derived patches from these two domains, initially based on displacements derived separately from shape-based processing of conventional B-mode data and block-mode, speckle-tracked processing of raw radio-frequency (RF) data; and later based on learning directly from B-mode and RF image intensity information. After non-rigid registration of rest and stress 4DE image sequences, quantitative 4D differential deformation parameters will be derived from porcine and human echocardiographic test data. These parameters will be derived at baseline, and at several timepoints after delivery of injectable hydrogels into the MI region. The ability of the differential deformation parameters derived from 4D stress echocardiography to guide local delivery of injectable hydrogels in a MI region and assess/predict outcomes will then be determined in a hybrid acute/chronic porcine model of MI and post-MI remodeling. The technique will be translated to humans and evaluated by measuring the reproducibility and the relationship to remodeling of our new robust, deep learning-based differential deformation parameters in a small cohort of subjects. Project Narrative  At the core of the proposed effort is the development and evaluation of novel 4D (three spatial dimensions over time) echocardiographic imaging, image analysis, and machine learning methods that will enable the accurate and robust quantification of changes in myocardial deformation due to stress. Our methods will use this information to guide delivery and assess outcome of a promising new therapy to improve the biomechanical properties of the heart after myocardial injury based on injectable hydrogels.","q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy",9890853,R01HL121226,"['3-Dimensional', '4D Imaging', 'Acute', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dobutamine', 'Echocardiography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Family suidae', 'Four-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'Four-dimensional', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydrogels', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infarction', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injectable', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'Ischemia', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Remodeling', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitor', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Property', 'Recombinants', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Stains', 'Stress', 'Stress Echocardiography', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ultrasonography', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Remodeling', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cohort', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'feedforward neural network', 'heart imaging', 'human subject', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'myocardial injury', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prevent', 'radio frequency', 'spatiotemporal', 'synthetic construct', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,795348,550947887,-0.001912855428079436
"High-definition, wide field of view corneal imaging The cornea is the primary focusing structure of our visual system. Infections and diseases in the tissue can impair vision and lead to blindness, even in eyes with intact neurosensory function. Corneal disease is one of the leading causes of visual deficiency and blindness in the world. Tissue evaluation is an important step for assessing the health of the donor cornea and its appropriateness for different types of placement, yet this process suffers from high subjectivity. High-definition corneal imaging is needed to assist in selection of the most appropriate tissue for transplant. Progress on this front would greatly serve public need, as the cornea is the most commonly transplanted tissue worldwide, with nearly 185,000 transplants annually. Thus, a more sensitive and quantitative method for objective evaluation of tissue at eye banks is needed. We have developed a 3D high-definition imaging instrument based on Gabor-Domain Optical Coherence Microscopy (GDOCM). Our SBIR Phase I research successfully accomplished all Aims and demonstrated the feasibility of quantitative assessment of corneal tissue over a large field of view with GDOCM. Our Phase I results demonstrated that GDOCM has the following key advantages over existing corneal imaging techniques, which include specular and confocal microscopy: 1) improved accuracy of tissue qualification with 4-10x increase in field of view that reduces sampling error – this will provides a truer assessment of the overall tissue characteristics; 2) ability to simultaneously measure corneal thickness, quantify endothelial cell density, and identify morphological variations due to corneal disease – this will lead to complete corneal evaluation in a single instrument; 3) leveraging machine learning innovations to minimize variability induced by users – this will result in a more objective evaluation; 4) enhanced 3D cellular-level imaging of thin translucent endothelial cells – this will enable a detailed understanding of cell viability. The results of the proposed Phase studies II will demonstrate that GDOCM can provide high-definition, 3D visualization of corneal structures with immediate commercial application for qualification of donor tissue in eye banks, and with a path to in vivo clinical imaging of patients with corneal disease. Current corneal evaluation methods employed at eye banks have limited field of view and/or insufficient resolution, and their results suffer from high subjectivity. We propose to commercialize a Gabor-domain optical coherence microscope to enable non-invasive, high-definition, wide field of view imaging in 3D for eye banks.","High-definition, wide field of view corneal imaging",10007064,R44EY028827,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Blindness', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Density', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell Viability Process', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye Banks', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Innovation Corps', 'International', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optics', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Patient imaging', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rights', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Errors', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissue Donors', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visual system structure', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinical imaging', 'commercial application', 'density', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo regeneration', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurosensory', 'novel', 'phase 2 study', 'programs', 'prototype', 'screening', 'three-dimensional visualization', 'tool', 'trend']",NEI,LIGHTOPTECH CORPORATION,R44,2020,795732,974517,-0.021610167617742242
"International Consortium for Multimodality Phenotyping in Adults with Non-compaction Summary Non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) is a heterogeneous, poorly understood disorder characterized by a prominent inner layer of loose myocardial tissue. Patients with NCCM are at increased risk of heart failure, stroke, severe rhythm irregularities and death. Current imaging techniques cannot differentiate pathological from benign hypertrabeculation. In addition, current echo/MRI-based criteria of NCCM lead to over-diagnosis of NCCM, provide no prognostic value, and lead to implantation of defibrillators (ICD) and the use of anticoagulation without a positive benefit in many otherwise healthy individuals with non-compacted myocardium. For a growing population diagnosed with NCCM there is an urgent need for better risk stratification to appropriately allocate (or safely withhold) these impactful preventive measures. Our international consortium combines expertise in myocardial disease, cardiac imaging and advanced computer analytics from 5 centers dedicated to the care of patients with cardiomyopathies, and has the ultimate goal to improve care of patients with non-compaction cardiomyopathy. We hypothesize that comprehensive analysis of clinical, genetic, structural and functional information will improve risk stratification. In addition, we hypothesize that detailed structural analysis will allow for differentiation of pathological and benign patterns of non-compaction. In a large cohort of adult patients with suspected NCCM we will perform in-depth phenotyping, including clinical information, pedigree data, genetics, echocardiography and MRI, and follow patients for up to 3 years. We will apply machine-learning based analytics to develop predictive models and compare their performance to currently used models and treatment criteria. Secondly, in a subset of patients we will perform high-resolution cardiac CT for detailed structural characterization of the myocardial wall. Novel analytical methods will be developed to characterize the 3D architectural complexity based on pathophysiological hypothesis, but also using hypothesis-free analyses of raw images using deep learning techniques. In addition, we will investigate associations between myocardial structure and regional contractile function, as assessed by echo and MRI. The aim of this proposal is to identify a structural signature associated with pathological non-compaction and improve developed risk prediction models. This international consortium dedicated to NCCM will be the first to collect genetic and multi-modality imaging data. Discovery of pathological structural signatures through innovative imaging techniques, in relation to myocardial contractility, will advance our understanding of NCCM. There is an urgent clinical need for diagnostic techniques that detect pathological non-compaction and identify patients at risk of devastating complications. This study is clinically relevant because the developed predictive models may permit more effective, personalized preventive care in a growing number of individuals diagnosed with non-compaction cardiomyopathy. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to the public health because recognition of pathological myocardial non- compaction and identification of patients at risk for embolic stroke, ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death will allow for more effective use of life-saving measures, but also avoid unnecessary ICD implantations and anticoagulation in healthy individuals with benign hypertrabeculation. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission that pertains to the discovery of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.",International Consortium for Multimodality Phenotyping in Adults with Non-compaction,9977674,R01HL146754,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Anticoagulation', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Benign', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defibrillators', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Event', 'Family member', 'Foundations', 'Fractals', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Structures', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left ventricular non-compaction', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Mutation', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Nature', 'Non-compaction cardiomyopathy', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive care', 'Preventive measure', 'Preventive therapy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Savings', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Techniques', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'accurate diagnosis', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'adverse event risk', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'density', 'disability', 'embolic stroke', 'genetic pedigree', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'imaging genetics', 'implantation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'research clinical testing', 'risk prediction model', 'sudden cardiac death', 'thrombogenesis', 'young adult']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,805761,560644462,-0.052232634444205166
"Improving cardiovascular image-based phenotyping using emerging methods in artificial intelligence Summary / Abstract Objective — The goal of this proposal is to develop and optimize novel deep learning (DL) assisted approaches to improve diagnosis and clinical decision-making for congenital heart disease (CHD). This will be achieved by using DL, machine learning (ML), and related methods to extract diagnosis, biometric characterizations, and other information from fetal ultrasound imaging. Notably, this work includes a clinical translational evaluation of these methods in a population-wide imaging collection spanning two decades, tens of thousands of patients, and several clinical centers. Background — Despite clear and numerous benefits to prenatal detection of CHD and an ability for fetal ultrasound to detect over 90% of CHD lesions in theory, in practice the fetal CHD detection rate is closer to 50%. Prior literature suggests a key cause of this startling diagnosis gap is suboptimal acquisition and interpretation of fetal heart images. DL is a novel data science technique that is proving excellent at pattern recognition in images. DL models are a function of the design and tuning of a neural network architecture, and the curation and processing of the image data used to train the network. Preliminary Studies — We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of experts in echocardiography and CHD (Drs. Grady, Levine, and Arnaout), DL and data science (Drs. Keiser, Butte and Arnaout), and statistics and clinical research (Drs. Arnaout and Grady) and secured access to tens of thousands of multicenter (UCSF and six other centers), multimodal fetal imaging studies. We have created a scalable image processing pipeline to transform clinical studies into image data ready for computing. We have designed and trained DL models to find key cardiac views in fetal ultrasound, calculate standard and advanced fetal cardiac biometrics from those views, and distinguish between normal hearts and certain CHD lesions. Hypothesis — While DL is powerful, much work is still needed to adapt it for clinical imaging and to translate it toward clinically relevant performance in patient populations. We hypothesize that an integrated ensemble DL/ML approach can lead to vast improvements in fetal CHD diagnosis. Aims — To this end, the main Aims of this proposal are (1) to develop and optimize neural network architectures and efficient data inputs to relieve key performance bottlenecks for DL in fetal CHD; and (2) to deploy DL models population-wide to evaluate their ability to improve diagnosis, biometric characterization, and precision phenotyping over the current standard of care. Our methods include DL/ML algorithms and retrospective imaging analysis. Environment and Impact — This work will be supported in an outstanding environment for research at the crossroads of data science, cardiovascular and fetal imaging, and translational informatics. The work proposed will provide valuable tools and insight into designing and evaluating both the data and the algorithms for DL on imaging for clinically relevant goals, and will lay important groundwork for DL-assisted phenotyping for both clinical use and precision medicine research. Project Narrative Medical imaging is critical to almost every type of diagnostic and management decision, but human interpretation of medical images can lack accuracy and reproducibility.

While conventional SPECT scanners using parallel-hole collimators are still the foundation of cardiac SPECT, recently our field observed an exciting growth of new developments of dedicated cardiac scanners. Such dedicated scanners, such as the GE Alcyone 530/570c systems and the D-SPECT systems both with CZT detectors, typically have multiple detectors collecting photons emitted from the heart simultaneously, leading to dramatically improved sensitivity (2-5 X). In addition, the GE systems use pinhole collimators and can achieve much higher resolution. These dedicated scanners opened doors to new applications with significant clinical impact, including ultra-low-dose imaging, absolute quantification of myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), high resolution molecular imaging, multi-isotope imaging, motion correction, and many more. Most of these new applications are uniquely achievable only using dedicated scanners. While the dedicated cardiac SPECT systems can improve clinical practice and lead to numerous new clinical applications, such systems are far from being optimized to fully realize their great potentials. In this grant, we propose to systematically develop and optimize innovative imaging technologies for the GE 530/570c systems to further improve its clinical efficacy in a variety of significant ways. In Aim 1, we will develop and optimize methods for static cardiac SPECT imaging. We will develop various deep learning methods and investigate approaches to increase angular sampling to reduce noise, and improve resolution and quantitative accuracy. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate methods for dynamic SPECT imaging, particularly involving direct parametric image reconstruction. In Aim 3, we will develop and validate methods for dual-isotope SPECT. Monte Carso simulation and deep learning based methods will be developed for tracers with different spatial distributions and fast kinetics. In all three aims, large animal studies and human subject data will be used for optimization and validation. Narrative The success of imaging technology developments proposed in this grant will substantially improve the image quality, reduce patient dose, expand the applications of cardiac SPECT from mainly static imaging to dynamic imaging, and establish multi-isotope clinical imaging.",Development of advanced cardiac SPECT imaging technologies,10064473,R01HL154345,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Amyloidosis', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Collimator', 'Computed Tomography Scanners', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DCNU', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Infarction', 'Isotopes', 'Kidney', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Molecular Target', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myopathy', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Tail', 'Toxic effect', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Validation', 'animal data', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical application', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'contrast enhanced', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'human subject', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'molecular imaging', 'new growth', 'parametric imaging', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'success', 'technology development']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,806926,550947887,-0.008550929696847419
"Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT PROJECT SUMMARY Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before heart attacks occur and is currently used to predict risk in millions of patients annually. Under the current grant, we have established a unique collaborative multicenter registry including over 23,000 imaging datasets (REFINE SPECT) with both prognostic (major adverse cardiovascular events) and diagnostic (invasive catheterization) outcomes. Using this registry, we have demonstrated that a combination of MPS image analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) tools achieved superior predictive performance compared to visual assessment by experienced readers or current state-of-the-art quantitative techniques. In the renewal, we plan to expand REFINE SPECT with now-available enhanced datasets (adding CT and myocardial blood flow information) and leverage latest AI advances to provide a personalized decision support tool for patient-specific cardiovascular risk assessment and estimation of benefit from revascularization following MPS. The overall aim is to optimize the clinical capabilities of MPS in risk prediction and treatment guidance by integrating all available imaging and clinical data with state-of-the-art AI methods. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: (1) To expand and enhance our REFINE SPECT registry including CT and MPS flow data, (2) To develop fully automated techniques for all MPS and CT image analysis, (3) To apply explainable deep learning time-to-event AI models for optimal prediction of MACE and benefit from revascularization from all image and clinical data. This work will result in an immediately deployable clinical tool, which will optimally predict risk of adverse events and establish the relative benefits from specific therapies, beyond what is possible by subjective visual analysis and mental integration of all imaging (MPS, CT, flow), and clinical data by physicians. Such quantitative integrative methods are not yet available, leaving the current practice for assessing risk and recommending therapy highly subjective. The precise quantitative results will be presented to clinicians in easy to understand terms (e.g., % risk per year, or relative risk of one therapy vs. the alternative) for a specific patient. Additionally, our methods to make AI conclusions more tangible will improve adoption of this technology. All results will be derived fully automatically thus eliminating any variability. Our approach will fit into current MPS practice and will be immediately translatable to clinics worldwide. Most importantly, this research will allow patients to benefit from increased precision and accuracy in risk assessment, thereby optimizing the use of imaging in guiding patient management decisions and ultimately improving outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myocardial perfusion imaging with SPECT is often used to predict who is at risk of heart attack and should undergo treatment such as coronary bypass or stenting; however, physicians read images visually and report results with wide variability. With the latest artificial intelligence tools and new types of imaging (including CT and fast SPECT scans), the investigators propose to develop and validate an automated clinical tool to optimize risk prediction and objectively establish the relative benefit of a specific therapy. This new tool will consider all available patient images and other relevant information to provide a personalized explanation and precise calculation of risk and potential benefits from therapy for each patient.",Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT,9888240,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Calcium', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catheterization', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Country', 'Cox Models', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Event', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Injections', 'International', 'Joints', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Stents', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adverse event risk', 'attenuation', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'personalized decision', 'prognostic', 'radiotracer', 'relating to nervous system', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'support tools', 'time use', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,808131,90419233,-0.0027587310395992574
"Novel Algorithms for Reducing Radiation Dose of CT Perfusion Project Summary/Abstract X-ray computed tomography (CT) has been increasingly used in medical diagnosis, currently reaching more than 100 million CT scans every year in the US. The increasing use of CT has sparked concern over the effects of radiation dose on patients. It is estimated that every 2000 CT scans will cause one future cancer, i.e., 50,000 cases of future cancers from 100 million CT scans every year. CT brain perfusion (CTP) is a widely used imaging technique for the evaluation of hemodynamic changes in stroke and cerebrovascular disorders. However, CTP involves high radiation dose for patients as the CTP scan is repeated on the order of 40 times at the same anatomical location, in order to capture the full passage of the contrast bolus. Several techniques have been applied for radiation dose reduction in CTP scans, including reduction of tube current and tube voltage, as well as the use of noise reduction techniques such as iterative reconstruction (IR). However, the resultant radiation dose of existing CTP scans is still significantly higher than that of a standard head CT scan. The application of IR techniques in CTP is very limited due to the high complexity and computational burden for processing multiple CTP images that impairs clinical workflow. During the Phase 1 STTR project, we introduced a novel low dose CTP imaging method based on the k-space weighted image contrast (KWIC) reconstruction algorithm. We performed thorough evaluation in both a CTP phantom and clinical CTP datasets, and demonstrated that the KWIC algorithm is able to reduce the radiation dose of existing CTP techniques by 75% without affecting the image quality and accuracy of quantification (i.e., Milestone of Phase 1 STTR). However, the original KWIC algorithm requires rapid-switching pulsed X-ray at pre-specified rotation angles – a hardware capability yet to be implemented by commercial CT vendors. In order to address this limitation, we recently introduced a variant of the KWIC algorithm termed k-space weighted image average (KWIA) that preserves high spatial and temporal resolutions as well as image quality of low dose CTP data (~75% dose reduction) to be comparable to those of standard CTP scans. Most importantly, KWIA does not require modification of existing CT hardware and is computationally simple and fast, therefore has a low barrier for market penetration. The purpose of the Phase 2 STTR project is to further optimize and validate the KWIA algorithm for reducing radiation dose of CTP scans by ~75% while preserving the image quality and quantification accuracy in CTP phantom, clinical CTP data and animal studies. We will further develop innovative deep-learning (DL) based algorithms to address potential motion and other artifacts in KWIA, and commercialize the developed algorithms by collaborating with CT vendors. Relevance to Public Health More than 100 million CT scans are performed every year in the US, estimated to cause 50,000 cases of future cancers. This project will develop, evaluate and commercialize novel CT imaging technologies that reduce the radiation dose of existing CT perfusion techniques by ~75% without compromising imaging speed or quality.",Novel Algorithms for Reducing Radiation Dose of CT Perfusion,10006737,R44EB024438,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Animals', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Infarction', 'Location', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Rotation', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Tube', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'contrast imaging', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'low dose computed tomography', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'preservation', 'radiation effect', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement', 'voltage']",NIBIB,"HURA IMAGING, INC",R44,2020,820709,820709,-0.008579193524871853
"Computer-Assisted Histologic Evaluation of Cardiac Allograft Rejection Project Summary Though cardiac transplantation is a lifesaving intervention, cardiac allograft rejection (CAR) remains a relatively common and serious complication that confers an increased risk of acute graft failure and adverse patient outcomes. For three decades, endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) with histological grading, as recommended by the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) has been the broadly applied standard for CAR diagnosis. However, it is widely appreciated that the ISHLT rejection grading standard lacks diagnostic accuracy and has limited ability to discern the mechanism of rejection. These limitations expose patients to risks of both over-treatment and under-treatment, and highlight the unmet need for more accurate and informative approaches to histopathologic analysis of EMB samples. Our team is a leader in computational pathology image analysis with over 200 papers and >30 issued patents in this area. We have already developed and evaluated a computer assisted histopathology grading evaluation (CACHE) scheme which (1) in N=205 patients, had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)=0.95 compared to two cardiac pathologists (mean AUC=0.74) in distinguishing normal from failing hearts and (2) could distinguish low and high ISHLT rejection grades in N=1109 patients with a performance that exceeds that of trained cardiac pathologists. Recognizing the frequent discordance between ISHLT rejection grade and the clinical trajectory of a rejection event, we will further develop and optimize CACHE to identify new “grade agnostic” morphologic biomarkers of clinically serious CAR. Our scientific premise is that morphologic biomarkers prioritized based on their correlation to patients’ clinical trajectories and underlying immunological disease mechanisms will generate an accurate, consistent and informative classifier for diagnosing allograft rejection. In service of this hypothesis, the proposed research will address three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will utilize computational image analysis to discover the morphologic biomarkers of rejection-related injury which are needed to develop a classifier capable of assessing the clinical trajectory of CAR. In Aim 2, we will provide mechanistic annotation of biomarkers identified in Aim 1 through correlation with in-situ immunologic markers using custom multi-parameter immunofluorescence panels. In Aim 3, we employ a multicenter, prospective cohort to validate the diagnostic and mechanistic accuracy of the new rejection classifier developed in Aims 1 and 2. Ultimately, development of a more accurate and mechanistically informative tool for morphologic diagnosis of CAR will improve patient outcomes by reducing over- and under- treatment and inspire applications in other organ transplants. Interestingly, development of a superior histologic diagnostic tool will empower development of alternative, biopsy-free diagnostic approaches that have been handicapped by the necessity of comparison with the flawed ISHLT rejection grade as a reference standard. Project Narrative For heart transplant recipients, allograft rejection remains a relatively common and serious complication associated with adverse patient outcomes. Shortcomings of the current rejection grading standard for heart biopsies leads to both over- and under-treatment, accordingly, this proposal will develop and validate a computer assisted rejection grading classifier that is more accurate, consistent and informative for diagnosing heart allograft rejection. Improved diagnostic accuracy will improve patient outcomes, inspire similar applications in other organ transplants and empower development of additional technologies that have been constrained by the current flawed rejection standard.",Computer-Assisted Histologic Evaluation of Cardiac Allograft Rejection,10070406,R01HL151277,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Allografting', 'Antibodies', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cardiac', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Graft Rejection', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart-Lung Transplantation', 'Histologic', 'Histopathologic Grade', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologics', 'In Situ', 'Injury', 'International', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Legal patent', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathologist', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'ROC Curve', 'Recurrence', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Stains', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'allograft rejection', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker validation', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'feature detection', 'graft failure', 'heart allograft', 'heart imaging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'overtreatment', 'pathology imaging', 'phenotypic data', 'population based', 'post-transplant', 'prospective', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'transplant centers', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment choice']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,845590,593605914,-0.002648275667425531
"An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis Project Summary  Improved methods for the bedside diagnosis and evaluation of neuromuscular disorders are needed. One technology that is finding increasing use for this purpose is electrical impedance myography (EIM). In EIM, a very weak, high frequency electrical current is passed through a muscle of interest and the resulting surface voltages are measured. Disease associated alterations in the composition and microstructural features of the muscle produce characteristic changes that can be used to help classify specific conditions and grade disease severity. To date, most studies using EIM analysis have utilized a fairly limited data set for disease assessment. While effective, this approach ignores a great deal of information locked within the impedance data, including those values that can assist in predicting specific muscle features (such as myofiber diameter) and the presence of pathological change (e.g., fat or connective tissue deposition). In addition, as it stands, the data set is challenging for the clinician to understand without a detailed knowledge of impedance theory. Myolex, Inc is a small business concern located in Boston, MA has as its main focus the development of EIM technologies for clinical use. Myolex recently completed a Phase 1 SBIR that demonstrated the potential capability of machine learning based classification algorithms to effectively discriminate healthy muscle from diseased and to discriminate one disease from another. In this proposed work, we will greatly advance this concept by embodying classification algorithms into a powerful new software suite for Myolex’s current EIM system, the mView. Our underlying hypothesis is that EIM data analysis can be automated to the point that classification systems can provide data on disease diagnosis as well as disease severity for improved ease-of-use. We propose to study this hypothesis via 2 specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will design a software suite capable of assisting with artifact-free data collection to be incorporated into our current EIM system, the mViewTM. Then using classification paradigms based on a prodigious amount of previous collected data, we will develop an automated data analysis tool to help provide data on disease category as well as microscopic features, muscle based on the impedance data alone using Microsoft’s Azure Cloud platform. In Specific Aim 2, we will test this developed software suite in a total of180 adult and pediatric neuromuscular disease patients and healthy participants evaluated at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (adults) and Boston Children’s Hospital (children). During this data collection period, the Ohio State and Boston Children’s researchers will have real- time access to Myolex staff to provide feedback and have questions/problems answered and addressed. The user interface will continue to be refined and classification algorithms improved. At the conclusion of this work, a new diagnostic tool will be developed for potential 510(k) FDA approval. It will serve as the basis for a continuously self-refining system as additional data sets are collected by end-users employing them in regular clinical use. Project Narrative  Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a valuable technique to assist with the evaluation of a variety of conditions affecting nerve and muscle. However, to date, only simplistic EIM outcomes have been utilized to assess muscle condition. In this proposed work, we will develop a software platform using machine learning to be incorporated into current EIM technology to allow for automated diseased classification and characterization using the entire large EIM data set collected with each muscle measurement. This will serve as the basis for a new, powerful and convenient tool for neuromuscular diagnosis that will continue to advance over time.",An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis,10002324,R44NS113756,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Area', 'Back Pain', 'Boston', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Connective Tissue', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Health', 'Inclusion Body Myositis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Technology', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Muscle', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Myography', 'Myopathy', 'Myositis', 'Nerve', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neuromuscular conditions', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Provider', 'Radiculopathy', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'classification algorithm', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'commercialization', 'complex data ', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'electric impedance', 'feature extraction', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'method development', 'nerve injury', 'neuromuscular', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric patients', 'physical therapist', 'prototype', 'sarcopenia', 'software development', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'voltage']",NINDS,"MYOLEX, INC.",R44,2020,869698,869698,-0.00034767180131434265
"Cardiac CT Deblooming PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease, killing over 370,000 Americans annu- ally2. Cardiac CT is a safe, accurate, non-invasive method widely employed for diagnosis of CAD and planning therapeutic interventions. With the current CT technology, calcium blooming artifacts severely limit the accuracy of coronary stenosis assessment. Similarly, stent blooming artifacts lead to overestimation of in-stent restenosis. As a result, many coronary CT angiography (CCTA) scans are non-diagnostic and result in patients receiving costly and invasive coronary angiography (ICA) procedures.  Based on extensive feasibility results, the goal of this project is to use deep learning innovations to fundamen- tally eliminate blooming artifacts without costly redesign of the CT hardware. A consortium between GE Re- search, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Weill Cornell Medicine will develop dedicated imaging protocols and machine learning methods to avoid or minimize blooming artifacts and evaluate the clinical impact of the proposed solutions. In Aim 1, the CT scan protocol will be optimized and paired with deep learning reconstruc- tion and post-processing algorithms to generate high-resolution CT images and prevent blooming artifacts. In Aim 2, image-domain and raw-data-domain deep learning processing algorithms will be developed to correct for residual blooming. After successful demonstration of the proposed methods on phantom scans and emulated clinical datasets, in Aim 3 the proposed CT methods will be clinically demonstrated and optimized based on 100 patients with coronary artery disease, using intravascular ultrasound as the ground-truth reference.  At the end of the project, we will have demonstrated and publicly disseminated a systematic methodology to essentially remove blooming artifacts in cardiac CT without a costly hardware upgrade. This will be another suc- cess of deep learning, enabling accurate coronary stenosis assessment and eliminating many unnecessary diag- nostic catheterizations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Blooming artifacts severely limit the accuracy of coronary stenosis assessment with cardiac CT, leading to un- necessary invasive coronary angiography procedures. The goal of this project is to eliminate blooming artifacts without costly redesign of the CT hardware, but based on optimized scan protocols and deep-learning-based image reconstruction and post-processing techniques. The proposed CT methods will be clinically demonstrated and optimized based on CT scans of 100 patients with coronary artery disease and using intravascular ultrasound as the ground-truth reference.",Cardiac CT Deblooming,9943684,R01HL151561,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Calcium', 'Caliber', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'New York', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Plant Roots', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Speed', 'Stenosis', 'Stents', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'calcification', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'diagnostic catheterization', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'machine learning method', 'man', 'microCT', 'mortality', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'restenosis', 'simulation', 'success', 'temporal measurement', 'virtual', 'virtual reality simulation']",NHLBI,GENERAL ELECTRIC GLOBAL RESEARCH CTR,R01,2020,900092,9617133,-0.02709566908708687
"Human Tumor Atlas Network: Data Coordinating Center Supplement This proposal is a collaboration with the HTAN Data Coordination Center DCC and describes an Image Data Project aimed at developing and deploying the technology needed for storage, distribution and basic analysis of cell and tissue images collected by multiple HTAN Centers. Multiplexed tissue images are an important type of data for nearly all of the centers contributing to the HTAN (second only to single cell sequencing data in number of centers collecting data). However, the software needed to visualize, analyze, manage, and share multiplexed images of tissues and tumors is underdeveloped. The initial availability of SARDANA images has highlighted the challenges faced by HTAN, including the DCC, in deploying an infrastructure for distributing large and complex images. We therefore propose a two-year HTAN Image Data Project (IDP) led by the DCC and HMS PCA focused on the rapid development and deployment of image informatic systems and computational resources for image management and analysis. Our goal is to put in place a functional first-generation system no later than summer 2020 and to then steadily refine the system so that it becomes the backbone of cross-functional HTAN atlases. As a matter of necessity, we will start with informatic systems and software that are either available today or in a relatively advanced state of development. However, we expect to evaluate these choices throughout the IDP and change course as necessary to incorporate potentially superior approaches. We will also support the diverse needs and formats of centers using different data collection methods. Aim 1 will focus on the deployment and progressive improvement of a cloud-based database for image management based on the OMERO standard as well as a parallel system for access to primary data. Aim 2 will develop and deploy software for visualizing HTAN image data by the general public. The IDP will use the existing MCWG and DAWG mechanisms for oversight and reporting, and all centers will be invited to participate. Within IDP, the HMS PCA will take primary responsibility for initial deployment of image informatics software. The DCC and HMS will jointly undertake software development and code hardening, and the DCC will take the lead in user assistance and software deployment, particularly in year two. Images of tumor specimens obtained from biopsy or surgery are one of the primary ways in which cancer is diagnosed and staged by pathologists, but such images have typically lacked molecular detail. The highly multiplexed tissue images being collected by HTAN will fundamentally change this, and it is therefore essential that the data be efficiently and widely distributed.

"Deep Learning for Automated Aortic Stenosis and Valvular Heart Disease Detection Using a Digital Stethoscope Abstract This SBIR Phase II project will develop a deep learning-based clinical decision support algorithm for detecting and diagnosing valvular heart disease based on heart sounds recorded using the Eko Core and Eko Duo Digital Stethoscopes. This screening tool will help to decrease the number of patients with valvular heart disease that remain undertreated simply because their condition is not diagnosed. Auscultation is commonly the method by which valvular heart disease is first detected, but cases often fail to be referred to echocardiography for diagnosis because clinicians fail to detect heart murmurs, particularly in noisy or rushed environments. To address this challenge, Eko had developed the Core, a digital stethoscope attachment that can be added in-line to a clinician’s existing stethoscope that amplifies heart sounds and Duo, a digital stethoscope in a handheld form factor with built-in single lead electrocardiogram. Both devices are designed to stream digitized phonocardiograms to a smartphone, tablet or personal computer. There, the signal can be analyzed with the decision support algorithm we will develop as part of this project. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to collect a database with condition- specific recording labels to enable deep learning for heart sounds though clinical data collection at six clinical sites, and (2) to develop and evaluate a collection of deep convolutional neural network-based algorithms trained on the database. These algorithms will (2a) distinguish between systolic, diastolic and continuous murmurs, (2b) classify aortic stenosis (AS), mitral regurgitation (MR), tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and innocent murmurs (2c) assess the severity of AS, MR and TR. By integrating these deep learning algorithms into Eko's mobile and cloud software platform, currently used by clinicians at over 1000 institutions worldwide, we anticipate this algorithm will enable more accurate screening for valvular heart disease in adult patients, leading to earlier diagnosis and better patient outcomes. Public Health Relevance Valvular heart disease is becoming an increasingly prevalent manifestation of poor cardiovascular health in both the developed and developing world. A highly-accurate clinical decision support algorithm that is able to detect and classify valvular heart disease will impact public health by reducing unnecessary referrals for echocardiography and promoting early and accurate diagnosis in underserved areas with limited access to specialty care.",Deep Learning for Automated Aortic Stenosis and Valvular Heart Disease Detection Using a Digital Stethoscope,10079904,R44HL144297,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Area', 'Auscultation', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Eko', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Sounds', 'Heart Valve Diseases', 'Heart murmur', 'Institution', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Stethoscopes', 'Stream', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency', 'accurate diagnosis', 'algorithm training', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical development', 'clinical research site', 'clinically significant', 'cloud software', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'experience', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'point of care', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'sound']",NHLBI,"EKO DEVICES, INC.",R44,2020,938347,938347,-0.009028923748564401
"Gadolinium Free Cardiac MR Imaging of Scar and Fibrosis Cardiovascular disease continues to be the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of scarred or fibrotic heart tissue plays a major diagnostic and prognostic role in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM). Cardiac MRI is a non-invasive, multifaceted imaging modality and is the clinical gold standard for scar and fibrotic cardiac tissue imaging with use of gadolinium-based contrast injection. However, administration of such gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) prolongs the scan time, increases scan cost, and is contra-indicated in patients with impaired kidney function? a highly prevalent comorbidity in CHD patients. Until recently, GBCA was presumed to be safe in patients with normal kidney function; however, there are emerging data on long-term GBCA retention in the body. We aim to develop two complimentary approaches to reduce GBCA use in myocardial, or cardiac muscle, scar imaging. Initially, we will develop a quantitative risk-benefit model to identify NICM patients with a low chance of having scarred myocardium. Concurrently, we will develop a GBCA-free cardiac MR myocardial tissue probe platform based on AI (MyoProbe.ai) to quantify scarred regions of the heart. To accomplish this, we will develop and evaluate an individualized, patient-specific scar prediction model to reduce GBCA use in NICM patients with different etiologies by training the model to learn to identify whether the patient is likely to have scarring based on non-contrast images. If it is unlikely that a patient has scarring, contrast administration can be avoided. To develop and evaluate MyoProbe.ai for GBCA-free quantification of myocardial scar in CHD patients, we will use AI to integrate signal intensity and heart motion data from MRI images to accurately locate and quantify scar tissue. This information can then be used by cardiologists to diagnose and treat the patient. We will rigorously validate our risk-benefit model and AI myocardial probe platform using retrospectively and prospectively collected cardiac MRI images from multiple healthcare centers, MRI vendors, and magnetic field strengths. Our dataset will include different types of NICM and CHD patient populations to ensure that our work is applicable to patients with many different types of NICM and CHD. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of scarred/fibrotic heart tissue with gadolinium- based contrast agents (GBCA) plays a major diagnostic and prognostic role in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM). However, administration of GBCAs prolongs the scan time, increases scan cost, contaminates surface and drinking water, is retained in the body long-term, and is contra-indicated in patients with impaired renal function– a highly prevalent comorbidity in CHD patients. The goal of our study is to reduce or eliminate GBCA use in cardiac MR scar imaging using artificial intelligence (AI) by concurrently developing a quantitative model to identify NICM patients with a low likelihood of scarring and a GBCA-free cardiac MR AI platform to quantify scar tissue.",Gadolinium Free Cardiac MR Imaging of Scar and Fibrosis,10072898,R01HL154744,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Fibrosis', 'Fostering', 'Gadolinium', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired Renal Function', 'Impairment', 'Injections', 'Ischemia', 'Kidney', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reference Standards', 'Relaxation', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Surface', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'coronary fibrosis', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'drinking water', 'heart imaging', 'heart motion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'magnetic field', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'radiomics']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,946194,135941803,0.005368657463174195
"West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification Project Summary – Overall West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) The West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) is committed to the overall goals of the NIH Common Fund Metabolomics Initiative and specifically aims to largely improve small molecule identifications. Understanding metabolism is important to gain insight into biochemical processes and relevant to battle diseases such as cancer, obesity and diabetes. Compound identification in metabolomics is still a daunting task with many unknown compounds and false positive identifications. The major goal of the WCMC is therefore to develop processes and resources that accelerate and improve the accuracy of the compound identification workflow for experts and medical professionals. The WCMC for Compound Identification is structured in three different entities: the Administrative Core, the Computational Core and the Experimental Core. The Center is led by the Director Prof. Fiehn in close collaboration with quantum chemistry experts Prof. Wang and Prof. Tantillo, and metabolomics experts Dr. Barupal and Dr. Kind with broad support from mass spectrometry, computational metabolomics and programming experts. The Administrative Core will assist the Computational and Experimental Core to develop and validate large in-silico mass spectral libraries, retention time prediction models and innovative methods for constraining and ranking lists of isomers in an integrated process of cheminformatics tools and databases. The developed tools and databases will be made available to all Common Fund Metabolomics Consortium (CF-MC) members and professional working groups. The WCMC will also provide guidance for compound identification to the National Metabolomics Data Repository. The broad dissemination of developed compound identification protocols, training for compound identification workflows, databases and distribution of internal reference standard kits for metabolomic standardization will overall widely support the metabolomics community.

"Automatic Organ Segmentation Tool for Radiation Treatment Planning of Cancers ABSTRACT As early detection and better treatment have increased cancer patient survival rates, the importance of protecting normal organs during radiation treatment is drawing more attention, which is critical in reducing long term toxicity of cancers. To avoid excessively high radiation doses to organs-at-risk (OARs), OARs need to be correctly segmented from simulation computed tomography (CT) scans during radiation treatment planning to get an accurate dose distribution. Despite tremendous effort in developing semi- or fully-automatic segmentation solutions, current automated segmentation software, mostly using the atlas-based methods, has not yet reached the level of accuracy and robustness required for clinical usage. Therefore, in current practice, significant manual efforts are still required in the OAR segmentation process. Manual contouring suffers from inter- and intra-observer variability, as well as institutional variability where different sites adopt distinct contouring atlases and labeling criteria, thus leading to inaccuracy and variability in OAR segmentation. When OARs are very close to the treatment target, segmentation errors as small as a few millimeters can have a statistically significant impact on dosimetry distribution and outcome. In addition, it is also costly and time consuming as it can take 1-2 hours of a clinicians’ time to segment major thoracic organs due to the large number of axial slices required. In summary, an accurate and fast process for segmenting OARs in treatment planning using CT scans is needed for improving patient outcomes and reducing the cost of radiation therapy of cancers. In recent years, the rapid development of deep learning methods has revolutionized many computer-vision areas and the adoption of deep learning in medical applications has shown great success. Based on a deep-learning-based algorithm we developed that achieved better-than-human performance and ranked 1st in 2017 American Association of Physicist in Medicine Thoracic Auto-segmentation Challenge, an automatic OAR segmentation product will be developed in this project with the three aims: 1) further improve the performance and robustness of OAR segmentation algorithms, focusing on addressing the heterogeneity issue of different clinical environments; 2) further enrich the functionalities and enhance usability of the cloud- based software product; and 3) perform clinical validation study on the algorithm performance and software usability at collaborating sites. With this product, the segmentation accuracy can be improved, leading to more robust treatment plans in protecting normal organs and improved long term patient outcome. The time and cost of radiation treatment planning can be greatly reduced, contributing to a more affordable cancer treatment and reduced healthcare burden. NARRATIVE As early detection and better treatment have increased cancer patient survival rates, the importance of protecting normal organs during radiation treatment is drawing more attention. To avoid excessively high radiation doses to such organs-at-risk (OARs), they are required to be correctly segmented from simulation computed tomography (CT) scans.

"Fully-Automated Lesion Characterization in Ultrawide-Field Retinal Images Abstract  In this grant application we propose to develop, EyeReadUWF, a fully automated tool for lesion characterization in ultra-widefield scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (UWF SLO) images. In recent times non mydriatic UWF SLO imaging has been shown to be a promising alternative to conventional digital color fundus imaging for grading of diabetic eye diseases, with advantages including 130°-200° field-of-view showing more than 80% of the retina in a single image, no need for multiple fields, multiple flashes, or refocusing between field acquisitions, ability to penetrate media opacities like cataract, and lower rate of ungradable images. UWF SLO images are particularly suitable for detecting predominantly peripheral lesions (PPLs), which have been associated with higher risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR) progression. Accurate quantification of presence and extent of PPLs can only be done by a robust automated tool that is specifically designed for the pseudo-colored images of UWF SLO modality. EyeReadUWF will automatically characterize lesions in pseudo colored UWF images while handling possible artifacts from eyelashes/eyelids and determine the lesion predominance in peripheral and central regions of UWF image. The ability to accurately quantify the presence and extent of predominantly peripheral lesions in UWF SLO images can enable clinicians to develop a more precise DR scoring scheme. This would help identify patients with higher risk of DR progression and onset of PDR, have a positive impact on diabetic patient management, and aid drug discovery research. Narrative The proposed tool, EyeReadUWF, will perform automated lesion characterization in ultra- widefield scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (UWF SLO) images to quantify the presence and extent of predominantly peripheral lesions (PPLs), which have been associated with higher risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR) progression. To the best of our knowledge, no commercial automated analysis tool is currently indicated for UWF SLO images.

"Plaque Risk Stratification Using Routinely Available CCTA to Optimize Therapeutic Decision-making in Patients with Known or Suspected Coronary Artery Disease Project Summary/Abstract New treatments have been revolutionary in improving outcomes over the last 30 years, yet cardiovascular disease still exerts a $320B annual burden on the US economy. Increasing evidence is showing that Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) may be an ideal modality to fill gaps in understanding the extent and rate of progression coronary artery disease. But despite the apparent promise of CCTA, there are barriers that prevent realizing the improvement that it theoretically provides. Currently available solutions do not overcome the barriers – a new approach is needed. Elucid Bioimaging has developed an image analysis software product vascuCAP (CAP stands for Computer Aided Phenotyping) to accurately quantify structural and morphological characteristics of plaque tissues linked to plaque rupture vulnerability. Fundamental to our approach is validated, objective quantitative accuracy; vascuCAP enjoys the most robust and well documented analytic validation of any plaque morphology software available. vascuCAP is the only system to mitigate specific issues in CT reconstruction known to effect accurate measurement of atherosclerotic plaque composition in routinely acquired CTA; it is the only system to effectively leverage objective tissue characterization validated by histology across multiple arterial beds; it achieves an effective resolution with routinely acquired CTA in the same ballpark as IVUS VH, based on solid mathematics principles that respect the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem; and it innovates by novel reporting that expresses the findings in a manner that fits efficiently into existing clinical workflows. vascuCAP has been implemented in a client-server model supporting SaaS. Working from our strong current device clearances, this research strategy is developed based on approved meeting notes from the FDA pre-submission process Phenotype classification claims to be cleared through direct De Novo pathway on the basis of accurately determining the class from in vivo CTA data relative to pathologist annotation on ex vivo specimen data. Risk prediction claims: validate ability to predict adverse events at one year, adding the IFU according to the direct De Novo pathway, One does not strictly depend on the other.This proposal is innovative in dealing with two fundamental limitations of the application of artificial intelligence and deep learning to the analysis of atherosclerosis imaging data. This proposal maximizes use of available retrospective data while putting in place the necessary structure for prospective validation and scale up. This proposal further develops vascuCAP as a tool that may reduce cost and length of clinical trials. While out of scope for this grant, it is important to also note that vascuCAP is innovative in its ability to support multi-scale modeling across cellular/molecular-level analyses and macroscopic manifestation. Also, vascuCAP’s quantitative ability makes it ideal for analysis of more advanced CT imaging protocols. These attributes complement and support the proposed objectives. Project Narrative Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) may be an ideal modality to fill gaps in understanding the extent and rate of progression coronary artery disease. But despite the apparent promise of CCTA, there are barriers that prevent realizing the improvement that it theoretically provides which currently available solutions do not overcome.

"Deviceless and Autonomous Prospective Cardiac CT Triggering PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. An estimated 3.8 million men and 3.4 million women die each year from CHD. Cardiac CT is a safe, accurate, non-invasive imaging modality used for diagnosing CHD and for planning therapeutic interventions. Cardiac CT exams are still challenging to perform due to the beating heart and the need to carefully time the scan based on cardiac phase and based on when the peak iodine contrast enhancement is reached. The overall exam duration and the complexity of performing these exams (contrasted with limited reimbursement levels) have limited patient access to cardiac CT to academic hospitals and specialized cardiac imaging centers. As compared to other CT exams, cardiac CT exams require additional patient preparation time, additional CT scans to track the bolus, and additional contrast agent to avoid missing the peak enhancement.  The goal of this project is to develop a smart cardiac CT scanner that autonomously determines the optimal scan time interval without ECG, traditional bolus tracking or timing bolus. Initial results show that it is possible to extract cardiac gating information from a few CT projection measurements prior to the diagnostic CT scan, without reconstruction. This is made possible by an innovative combination of fast X-ray tube pulsing and deep learning raw data analysis. This project builds on GE Research's experience with cardiac CT technologies, deep learning algorithms and X-ray tube physics, as well as the strong clinical cardiac CT expertise at the University of California San Diego.  The outcome of this project will be a clinical feasibility study of the autonomous triggering approach, which has the potential to simplify and increase patient access to cardiac CT, while reducing exam time, reducing con- trast agent volume, and ensuring robust image quality. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop a smart cardiac CT scanner that autonomously determines the optimal scan time interval without ECG, traditional bolus tracking or timing bolus. The result will be a patient-friendly and technologist-friendly cardiac CT exam with reduced exam time, minimal contrast agent volume and radia- tion dose, and robust image quality.",Deviceless and Autonomous Prospective Cardiac CT Triggering,10029731,R01HL153250,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Bolus Infusion', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Ensure', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Iodine', 'Measurement', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preparation', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Rotation', 'Scanning', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'men', 'non-invasive imaging', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'standard of care', 'temporal measurement', 'time interval']",NHLBI,GENERAL ELECTRIC GLOBAL RESEARCH CTR,R01,2020,1060608,9617133,0.0005082910476737121
"Clinical Development and Evaluation of a Deep Learning Approach to Improve Diagnostic Accuracy PROJECT SUMMARY Introduction: PhotoniCare, Inc. is a medical device company developing the TOMi Scope, a handheld, optical imaging device for improved diagnosis of middle ear health. The purpose of this proposal is to establish and evaluate a machine learning approach to facilitate both: (1) ease and reliability of quality data capture in a pediatric population from users with a range of otscopy expertise, and; (2) assist interpretation of the TOMi Scope’s correlated otoscopy and depth-resolved images in order to enable improved diagnostic accuracy and, ultimately, effective management. Significance: Ear infections affect 93% of all children, yet they are one of the most poorly diagnosed (~50% accuracy) and managed diseases in all of medicine, resulting in high antimicrobial over-prescription and resistance development. Correctly identifying the absence or presence/type of middle ear effusion (MEE; fluid) through the non-transparent eardrum is critical to accurate diagnosis, and the limited current diagnostic tools suffer poor diagnostic adoption (7-38% reported use) and accuracy (50-70%) due to inherent subjectivity and dependence on user expertise. Therefore, there is a clear and unmet need for superior, objective screening, starting with a definitive yet easily and reliably usable diagnostic tool for this extremely prevalent yet poorly managed disease. Hypothesis: Applying a machine learning approach to TOMi Scope imaging guidance and diagnostic classification will facilitate both: 1) ease-of-use and reliable quality data collection improvement, and 2) accurate detection of the presence or absence of MEE, as well as classification of the type of infection, regardless of user experience. Specific Aims: (1) Collect labeled TOMi Scope data (otoscopy and depth-scan images) from 268 patients at pediatric offices affiliated with UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, (2) Achieve reliable usability of the TOMi Scope by guiding image capture using TOMi-net, a deep learning model, (3) Develop a multimodal deep learning model to provide diagnostic assistance using TOMi Scope otoscopy and depth-scan data. Commercial Opportunity: The TOMi Scope will provide physicians with a superior user experience and new, objective information, enabling better decision-making for antibiotic prescription and surgical intervention. This has the potential to impact the standard of care for ~1B children worldwide that experience ear infections, representing a multi-billion-dollar commercial opportunity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ear infections (otitis media) are highly prevalent in the pediatric population and represent a significant clinical challenge due to the limitations of the gold-standard diagnostic tools, resulting in high antimicrobial prescription and consequent resistance development. Accurate detection and classification of effusion (fluid) in the middle ear is a critical element for this diagnosis, and for making informed medical treatment decisions, particularly regarding antibiotic stewardship. The long-term goal of this work is to reduce antibiotic resistance and healthcare costs through improving patient outcomes by addressing the low diagnostic accuracy and user experience issues of current subjective methods, with a novel, non-invasive imaging tool capable of quantitative depth-resolved measurements to not only visualize the underlying infection behind the eardrum, but also, with automated machine learning image analysis algorithms, minimize user experience dependence and variability.",Clinical Development and Evaluation of a Deep Learning Approach to Improve Diagnostic Accuracy,10156035,R44DC017422,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Appointment', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Unit', 'Collection', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ear', 'Elements', 'External auditory canal', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Infection', 'Label', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Otitis Media', 'Otitis Media with Effusion', 'Otoscopy', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Resistance development', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tympanic membrane', 'Universities', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'antimicrobial', 'bacterial resistance', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'ear infection', 'effusion', 'electronic data capture system', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'image guided', 'improved', 'middle ear', 'middle ear fluid', 'multimodality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDCD,"PHOTONICARE, INC.",R44,2020,1136886,1136886,-0.01654988862221294
"Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) Overall Project Summary  The Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) pursues a mission of bringing people together to create new ways of seeing. The work of our Center has been focused on creating new paradigms for the acquisition, reconstruction, and interpretation of biomedical images, and on implementing new collaboration models in order to translate these developments rapidly into clinical practice.  The world of biomedical imaging is changing, and CAI2R has been at the forefront of that change. Tasks that were once the sole domain of meticulously-engineered imaging hardware are now beginning to be accomplished in software, increasingly informed by diverse arrays of inexpensive auxiliary sensors. Information once pursued through the laborious acquisition of carefully separated image datasets is now being derived from newly integrated, and richly quantitative, data streams. In keeping with these themes, our Center will be organized around the following four Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects going forward: 1. Reimagining the Future of Scanning: Intelligent image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis. 2. Unshackling the Scanners of the Future: Flexible, self-correcting, multisensor machines. 3. Enriching the Data Stream: MRI and PET in concert. 4. Revealing Microstructure: Biophysical modeling and validation for discovery and clinical care.  In each of these projects, we aim to push medical imaging technology to the next level, both in hardware and in software. Having made great strides in developing rapid, continuous imaging data streams, we will next aim to add key new information to those streams, both from physics-driven microstructural modeling and from data- driven machine learning. Having focused on the development of robust tools for image acquisition and reconstruction, we will extend the pipeline to image interpretation, using the results of human- or machine- derived evaluations of image content as feedback for the further improvement of acquisition strategies and sensor designs. We will also aim to close the loop between diagnostic sensing and therapeutic intervention, exploring new ways to guide therapy with continuously-acquired information about tissue bioeffects.  Our Center has an explicit translational focus, which is reflected in the day-to-day operation of TR&D projects as well as in the topics of Collaborative Projects (CPs) and Service Projects (SPs), which are focused on three general areas of high public health impact: cancer, musculoskeletal disease, and neurologic disease.  In keeping with this translational emphasis, CAI2R is also be driven by an embedded collaboration model in which basic scientists, clinicians, and industry developers sit down together regularly at the scanners for interactive technology development and assessment. With early involvement of clinical stakeholders and industry partners, we aim to make CAI2R technologies widely available, for the advancement of biomedical knowledge and for the benefit of patients and the physicians who care for them. Overall Project Narrative  The Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) develops novel imaging techniques and technologies for the improved diagnosis and management of cancer, musculoskeletal disease, neurological disease and other disorders with a profound impact on human health. By exploiting connections between imaging modalities such as MRI and PET, we aim to advance the fundamental capabilities of each, so as to expand biomedical knowledge and improve the care of patients.",Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R),9996604,P41EB017183,"['Adopted', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biology', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Engineering', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagination', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Industrial Product', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Philosophy', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Software Tools', 'Stream', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'bioimaging', 'biophysical model', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'data acquisition', 'data streams', 'design', 'flexibility', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'imaging scientist', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel imaging technique', 'open source', 'operation', 'radio frequency', 'reconstruction', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'technology research and development', 'tool', 'web site']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,P41,2020,1198860,329565273,-0.0047182159682931865
"An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System In this SBIR Phase IIb proposal Xoran intends to commercialize a compact and affordable, yet highly- functional, system to provide real time image updates and navigation guidance in support of minimally invasive cranial and spinal neurosurgical procedures. The effort builds on previously developed compact and portable flat-panel Computed Tomography (CT) technology which has been commercialized for hard tissue applications, and incorporates work done in earlier phases of this project to generate viable high- quality images of the soft tissue structures in the brain. Intraoperatively obtained images tightly integrated into an onboard surgical navigation will provide updated instrument localization using next generation electromagnetic tool tip guidance. Workflow optimizations become possible when the imaging and guidance are one device, including fast local image updates, automatic image-to-world registration, as well as speed and simplicity of use. The project includes expansion of the system capabilities to facilitate precise minimally-invasive surgical removal of tumors in both the head and spine. It incorporates a machine-learning based deep neural network method for image finalization to allow high quality, low radiation image updates. The three-year project involves meeting technical milestones of system development including imaging capability, registration, navigation accuracy, speed, workflow, radiation dose considerations and cost. Clinical evaluations will take place at University of Michigan, and a team of consulting physicians has been assembled for oversight, input and feedback. Narrative / Relevance to Public Health Minimally invasive surgical procedures have many benefits to public health including reducing the medical risks and costs associated with brain cancer and spine surgery. However such procedures are often time consuming and technically difficult as the surgeon is unable to directly visualize the area of the operation. In this project, an intraoperative surgical system is developed with onboard imaging capability in order to enable minimally invasive surgeries to be performed more safely and completely, by providing hi-resolution imaging of the brain and spine while the surgeon operates.",An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System,10017876,R44CA112966,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Canis familiaris', 'Capital', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Cephalic', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computed Tomography Scanners', 'Consensus', 'Consult', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Electromagnetics', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Feedback', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Investments', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metals', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone', 'Michigan', 'Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures', 'Monitor', 'Navigation System', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Neurosurgical Procedures', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pituitary Neoplasms', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spine surgery', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Vertebral column', 'Veterinary Medicine', 'Veterinary Schools', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer site', 'cancer surgery', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'cranium', 'deep neural network', 'human subject', 'image guided', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'meetings', 'minimally invasive', 'neurosurgery', 'next generation', 'operation', 'point of care', 'portability', 'real-time images', 'research clinical testing', 'soft tissue', 'spine bone structure', 'tool', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,"XORAN TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R44,2020,1279629,1528783,-0.008724982699027127
"Overall: Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Vanderbilt Founded in 1965 as one of the original Intellectual and Developmental Disorders Research Centers (IDDRC), the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center (VKC) IDDRC serves as the central nexus across Vanderbilt for interdisciplinary research, communication, and training in intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The VKC IDDRC serves as a trans-institutional institute that brings together over 200 faculty from 38 departments in 10 schools at Vanderbilt. The VKC’s mission to facilitate discoveries that inform best practices to improve the lives of people with IDD and their families. This mission is met by leveraging our outstanding institutional resources and support, partnering with disability communities, and capitalizing on synergistic interactions across the VKC’s federally-designated centers: the VKC IDDRC, a University Center of Excellence in Developmental Disabilities and a Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities program. The IDDRC as the centerpiece of the VKC is the foundational organizing structure that creates a “Center culture” wherein research and discovery permeates the VKC’s broader training and service activities, thus enhancing the translational research goals of the IDDRC. Demonstrable IDDRC success includes 976 investigator- authored publications and robust NIH funding to Vanderbilt to support IDD-related research ($52.6M in FY20). Harnessing and leveraging this trans-institutional strength to focus on unique challenges in IDD, the overarching goal of the next phase of the IDDRC is to develop precision care for IDD by providing infrastructure and scientific leadership to enable rapid translation of basic discoveries into high- impact IDD interventions and treatments. Three global Aims guide the IDDRC’s work. Aim 1 provides core services to enable and disseminate impactful research on individualizing treatments based upon the causes, mechanisms, and contributing co-morbid sequelae of IDD; Aim 2 focuses on incorporating innovative methods and approaches to enhance multidisciplinary IDD research; and Aim 3 proposes to conduct a signature research project to improve the precision use of antipsychotic medication in people with autism. Across these Aims and five Cores supported by the IDDRC (Administrative, Clinical Translational, Translational Neuroscience, Behavioral Phenotyping, and Data Sciences), three themes permeate our work: (1) recruitment of highly-skilled researchers not currently conducting IDD research (non-traditional researchers); (2) inclusion of IDD participants into research studies that currently do not include IDD (non-traditional subjects); and (3) incorporation of novel scientific approaches and methods (non-traditional approaches). Our IDDRC is ideally posed to enable rapid discovery of precision care approaches by supporting 50 investigators leading 70 research projects (15 from NICHD) and, as highlighted by the Signature Research Project, to promote and implement generative, novel, and impactful research directions, thus meeting the NICHD’s vision of applying newly evolved technologies and approaches to rapidly accelerate the prevention and/or amelioration of IDDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a group, intellectual and developmental disabilities, including Down syndrome and autism spectrum disorder, have dramatic effects on affected people’s and their caregiver’s lives. Unfortunately, there remains a lack of understanding about what causes these disabilities and, critically, how to treat them with targeted therapies. The Vanderbilt Kennedy Center’s Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center serves as the hub for Vanderbilt’s research efforts focusing on improving the lives of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities by understanding the causes of these disorders and developing and testing therapies tailored to each individual’s precise needs.",Overall: Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Vanderbilt,10085550,P50HD103537,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Affect', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Down Syndrome', 'Education', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Centers', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policy Research', 'Prevention', 'Problem behavior', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'clinical translation', 'comorbidity', 'cost effective', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'drug-induced weight gain', 'experience', 'image processing', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'translational neuroscience', 'trial comparing']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P50,2020,1387605,377931988,-0.02882926922874249
"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Contact PD/PI: Panettieri, Reynold Alexander Project Summary/Abstract Overview Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium. In this revised application, the overall themes remain unchanged but Cores leadership and direction has been markedly refined.

"In-Office, Ultrasound-Based Breakage and Removal of Urinary stones OVERALL SUMMARY  The main focus of this Program Project Grant is to discover the foundational and translational knowledge needed to create an office-based handheld ultrasound device to target, detach, break, and expel stones and stone fragments from the urinary space to facilitate natural clearance. This system will obviate costly and inefficient emergency department visits that typically include repetitive exposure to ionizing radiation from diagnostic imaging, and will significantly reduce the often lengthy (days to weeks) wait time patients must endure before procedures for stone removal can be scheduled and performed. As the proposed therapy system is entirely noninvasive, patients will be treated on an outpatient basis. Further, as the system is designed to efficiently and painlessly break stones of any size and expel the fragments from the kidney, the treatment of both symptomatic and asymptomatic stones using this technology will reduce the high retreatment and stone event recurrence rates associated with current surgical interventions for stone removal.  In this effort, we will combine stone breakage by burst wave lithotripsy (BWL), clearance of fragments by ultrasonic propulsion (UP), and stone-specific ultrasound imaging (S-mode) into an integrated system in which exposure strategies are adapted during treatment in response to real-time acoustic feedback to enhance comminution efficiency and patient safety. We will tailor treatment by investigating numerically and in lab tests the primary mechanisms - cavitation and elastic waves - involved in the comminution process over a broad parameter space. We will develop acoustics-based feedback including model- based, machine learning and passive acoustic mapping (PAM) of the bubble field to signal the need to adjust the energy output. We will investigate the morphological and functional response of the kidney in living animals and in ex vivo perfused porcine kidneys, and pursue tissue protective treatment strategies such as power ramping.  These studies will include the first in-human test of BWL in which we will compare the comminution effectiveness and safety of treatment with and without adaptive output control in response to acoustic feedback. In addition, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of the benefits and risks of fragmenting and expelling symptomatic and asymptomatic stones in the clinic. Toward application of the system for use in humans, we will refine and validate the use of UP and S-mode together to improve stone and fragment detection. With our eye on the future of stone management, we will develop and validate in vivo an extracorporeal acoustic tractor beam to grasp and carry fragments through the complex three- dimensional path of the urinary space and out of the kidney. OVERALL NARRATIVE Urinary stone disease, which affects 1 in 11 Americans, is one of the most painful diseases and also the costliest non-malignant urologic disease, because current management is limited to observation for the stone to pass or performing surgery. The main focus of this Program Project Grant is to discover the foundational and translational knowledge needed to create an office-based, handheld ultrasound device to target, detach, break, and expel stones and stone fragments from the urinary space to facilitate natural clearance. This system will obviate costly and temporizing emergency department visits and radiation exposing imaging while the patient waits in pain for days to weeks for the stone to pass or be surgically removed.","In-Office, Ultrasound-Based Breakage and Removal of Urinary stones",10005352,P01DK043881,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Bowman&apos', 's space', 'Calibration', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lithotripsy', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Non-Malignant', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Painless', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Program Research Project Grants', 'Publications', 'Radiation exposure', 'Ramp', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Renal Tissue', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retreatment', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Schedule', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Wait Time', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'calcification', 'complex data ', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'grasp', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individualized medicine', 'next generation', 'patient safety', 'programs', 'response', 'safety study', 'simulation', 'structured data', 'success', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,P01,2020,1567293,533302350,-0.0148182614252407
"DIGITAL HEALTH SOLUTIONS FOR COVID-19: PERSONALIZED ANALYTICS WEARABLE BIOSENSOR PLATFORM FOR EARLY DETECTION OF COVID-19 DECOMPENSATION The goal of this project is to develop an artificial intelligence-based data analytics and cloud computing platform, paired with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared wearable devices, to create a personalized baseline index that could indicate a change in health status for patients who have tested COVID-19 positive.  The project involves the development and validation of a COVID-19 Decompensation Index (CDI) that builds off physIQ’s existing wearable biosensor-derived analytics platform.  Data will be collected from 400 human subjects that are both pre-hospitalization subjects (found to be positive for COVID-19) and subjects that have been hospitalized and treated for COVID and then discharged.  This combined population will consist of COVID-19 decompensation cases (event cases) and cases for which COVID-19 did not result in any kind of decompensation (non-event cases).  The 400-patient dataset will be partitioned into a training subset and a testing subset.  Performance will be assessed using receiver operator characteristics (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) as the metric of performance.

"Combined Cardiopulmonary Failure in COPD: SPIROMICS HF The death rate and hospitalizations from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have doubled in the last 50 years. A third of COPD hospitalizations overlap with heart failure, mostly with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), yet no large COPD study has ascertained cardiac function. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) COPD Study was funded to test the endothelial hypothesis of emphysema and examine reduced RV dimensions (“cor pulmonale parvus”) in COPD. In the MESA COPD Study II, we found that associations of reduced pulmonary microvascular blood flow with emphysema do not appear to be confounded by hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and that emphysema on CT predicted RV regression over 5 years. We also developed methods to further subtype emphysema and COPD and scaled them up to the SubPopulations and InteRmediate Outcome Measures In COPD Study (SPIROMICS). We used unsupervised machine learning to discover new emphysema subtypes that are common and have molecular origins. Separately, we found that 26% of adults have segmental airway variants, which are associated with COPD and the developmental genes FGF10 and RARA. Both genes affect right heart development. In pilot work, we found one dramatically altered RV strain and the other associated with cor pulmonale parvus. Finally, we found that bronchitic ‘symptomatic smokers,’ who have hyperinflation from gas trapping, may have increased LV diastolic dysfunction. Hence, cardiac alterations in COPD are complex but recent advances in COPD subtyping may allow their personalized diagnosis and treatment. SPIROMICS is an NHLBI-funded prospective study that recruited smokers with COPD and controls and is re-examining 2,000 participants with gold- standard lung phenotyping including full-lung CT. We propose to add comprehensive echocardiography (echo) with speckle-tracking for cardiac mechanics for 1,000 SPIROMICS participants, with exercise in 700 and cardiopulmonary MRI in 600, to test the following hypotheses: 1) machine-learned subtypes of emphysema on CT are associated with specific alterations in cardiac structure and function, which vary from cor pulmonale to LV diastolic dysfunction; 2) participants with segmental airway variants have abnormal RV structure and function; 3) symptomatic smokers have signs of increased LV afterload and LV diastolic dysfunction. Innovative aspects of the application include the use of novel echo and MRI measures in a large, well- characterized cohort of COPD patients. Confirmation of the hypotheses would define the mechanisms of HFpEF in COPD and identify subsets of patients for targeted treatment of cardiopulmonary dysfunction. The death rate and hospitalizations from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have doubled in the last 50 years. A third of COPD hospitalizations overlap with heart failure, mostly with preserved ejection fraction. The proposed study would be the first large study with gold-standard phenotyping of the heart and lungs and would test highly specific hypothesized based upon recent advances in lung subphenotyping to yield personalized approaches to combined cardiopulmonary disease in COPD.",Combined Cardiopulmonary Failure in COPD: SPIROMICS HF,10020427,R01HL093081,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Apical', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DRD1 gene', 'Death Rate', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Drops', 'EFRAC', 'Echocardiography', 'Endothelium', 'Exercise', 'FGF10 gene', 'Failure', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gases', 'Genes', 'Gold', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Kinetics', 'Lung', 'Lung CAT Scan', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Myocardial', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Pulmonary Heart Disease', 'Pulmonary artery structure', 'RARA gene', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Right Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Right ventricular structure', 'Sampling', 'Smoker', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiogenesis', 'cohort', 'disorder control', 'disorder subtype', 'genetic variant', 'heart function', 'heart preservation', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'lung hypoxia', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'patient subsets', 'personalized approach', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'receptor', 'recruit', 'targeted treatment', 'unsupervised learning', 'vasoconstriction']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,2331272,558628098,-0.001846935956500176
"Eavesdropping on heart-brain conversations during sleep for early detection and prevention of fatal cardiovascular disease ABSTRACT  The intimate link between the heart, brain and sleep is central to our well-being and ability to meet the demands of life. A majority of cardiovascular (CV) deaths occur in the early waking hours from sleep. For example, sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), an extremely prevalent and devastating condition, claims more lives (>350,000/year) in the USA than all disease-related causes of death combined. A defibrillator can prevent SCA, but current clinical strategies are grossly inadequate, both in terms of identifying people at risk and importantly, monitoring and controlling the CV risk. To address this major gap, we are proposing an entirely novel approach for studying heart-brain interactions during sleep. To our knowledge, our compelling new preliminary data and innovative strategy are unprecedented.  In robust preliminary studies of animals and humans, we have identified unique signatures of evolving, potentially fatal, CV disease within electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) waveforms that otherwise cannot be detected by current clinical methods and conventional statistics. Our powerful new tools reveal these “hidden” signatures during sleep (i.e., as conscious activity decreases and autonomic control of the heart becomes prominent). This missing link we have identified between the heart, brain, spontaneous intrinsic arousals, and critical CV disease is independent (in multivariate analyses) of sleep disordered breathing (e.g., apnea) and established risk factors. Our novel and highly promising findings may account for the high incidence of CV deaths associated with sleep and have potential for broad application, ranging from animal models to improved reclassification of individuals currently consid- ered “low”, “moderate” or “high” risk in contemporary clinical practice. This is important because asymptomatic individ- uals without advanced CV disease comprise the majority of SCA victims. They also are the ones “missed” by current risk stratification methods and the most challenging to identify. Further, our fundamental new approach to EEG and ECG analysis will add new, clinically valuable, prognostic insight for patients with advanced CV disease (e.g., heart failure). This robust, inexpensive, personalized strategy for identifying who will and will not need lifesaving therapy will also avoid unnecessary procedures and complications, and thus, will provide substantial socioeconomic benefits.  This paradigm-shifting application for a NIH Director’s New Innovator Award incorporates clinical cardiac electro- physiology, critical care and sleep medicine with engineering, mathematics, artificial intelligence, statistical dynamical systems, and molecular, cellular and clinical research to enable early diagnosis and therapy of critical CV disease. Our unique approach for gaining novel mechanistic insight into CV pathology and risk during sleep is likely to spawn new avenues in collaborative multidisciplinary research. Because our new paradigm can be seamlessly incorporated into existing technology readily available in hospitals and clinics, we expect our findings to rapidly transform contem- porary clinical practice in multiple fields. Importantly, the ability to identify and decode “hidden” EEG and ECG signa- tures of early onset of fatal, subclinical CV illness, including SCA, the leading cause of death in the industrialized world, has extraordinary implications for human health and the potential for broad worldwide application. NARRATIVE  The treatment of heart disease after clinical presentation has limited success. Irreversible organ system damage often initiates by the time the patient presents clinically. We seek to introduce, understand and validate a completely new approach for analyzing heart and brain signals to reveal information about evolving critical disease in an individual that otherwise would remain undetected by current clinical methods until catastrophic clinical presentation. If validated, this new paradigm will have extraordinary implications for human health and the potential to open new avenues in research and therapy.",Eavesdropping on heart-brain conversations during sleep for early detection and prevention of fatal cardiovascular disease,10002962,DP2HL157941,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Apnea', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Brain', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Pathology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Conscious', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Defibrillators', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Engineering', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'body system', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'dynamic system', 'early onset', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized strategies', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'socioeconomics', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,DP2,2020,2407500,88720000,-0.0061424137568651645
"Aging eyes and aging brains in studying alzheimer's disease: Modern ophthalmic data collection in the adult changes in thought (ACT) study PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT The overarching goals of this R01 proposal are to improve scientific understanding of potential mechanisms by which ophthalmic diseases lead to the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. The investigators will leverage modern ophthalmic data with state-of-the-art imaging and extensive archived clinical data from a well-characterized cohort of older adults. The investigators propose to examine the effect of structural and functional changes in retina and longitudinal severity of ophthalmic diseases on Alzheimer’s disease and related neuropathology. The proposal builds on the resources of the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study, a prospective longitudinal, population-based, dementia-free cohort of over 5,500 people to date established in 1994 which has detected >1,014 research quality diagnoses of Alzheimer’s disease and >1,254 dementia to date. ACT follows consenting participants to autopsy and has performed state-of-the arts autopsy on >781 decedents to date. In this extremely well-characterized cohort, the investigators found that several ophthalmic diseases (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration) are significantly associated with the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. The investigators will use three advanced ophthalmic imaging modalities at both home and clinical research study visits: fundus photography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and OCT angiography (OCTA), to obtain quantitative data relevant to these ophthalmic diseases. The study team will establish the distribution (Aim 1a) and 2- and 4-year evolution of ophthalmic imaging characteristics found in older adults in the community and determine associations with change in cognition (Aim 1 b, c). Additionally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI angiography (MRA) will be obtained in a subset of participants to investigate the contribution of small (retinal) and large (cerebral) vascular disease towards cognitive changes (Aim 1d). The study team will continue ACT study’s strong commitment for meaningful data sharing. In collaboration with the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging at University of Southern California, the study team will promulgate these ophthalmic data in addition to neuroimaging data to the research community (Aim 1e). In Aim 2, the investigators will use extensive clinical ophthalmology data captured over many decades and incorporate them in novel longitudinal models of eye disease severity. The investigators will analyze eye disease severity along with extensive neuropathology data from the ACT study, including both standard (Aim 2a) and novel quantitative (Aim 2b) neuropathology data, to further scientific understanding of neuropathological mechanisms underlying associations between eye conditions and Alzheimer’s disease risk. The brain is not amenable to direct observations during life. In contrast, the eye is an anterior extension of the central nervous system and may provide a valuable window to illuminate neurodegenerative processes in the aging brain. Proposed investigations will substantially enhance scientific understanding of the role of modern ophthalmic evaluations in delineating risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of neuropathology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Using a large, well-characterized, longitudinal, prospective, cohort study, the study team previously found that diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration were significantly associated with Alzheimer’s disease risk. The team proposes to use three cutting edge ophthalmic imaging modalities to obtain quantitative data at both home and clinic research study visits in addition to MRI and MRA in a subset of participants to evaluate their associations with change in cognition over time (Aim 1). The team will leverage extensive ophthalmic clinical and neuropathological data already available for 781 study participants to date as well as new state-of-the-art quantitative measures of beta amyloid (Aβ1-42) and phosphorylated tau to elucidate mechanisms underlying associations between ophthalmic conditions and Alzheimer’s disease (Aim 2).",Aging eyes and aging brains in studying alzheimer's disease: Modern ophthalmic data collection in the adult changes in thought (ACT) study,10005108,R01AG060942,"['Adult', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Angiography', 'Anterior', 'Archives', 'Autopsy', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drusen', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Fundus photography', 'Ganglion Cell Layer', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neuraxis', 'Occipital lobe', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Selection Bias', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'aging brain', 'area striata', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis quality', 'epidemiology study', 'fiber cell', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'paired helical filament', 'population based', 'prospective', 'public repository', 'research study', 'resilience', 'tau Proteins', 'tau-1', 'vascular contributions']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,3349913,533302350,-0.07702953672345
"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Contact PD/PI: Panettieri, Reynold Alexander Project Summary/Abstract Overview Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium. In this revised application, the overall themes remain unchanged but Cores leadership and direction has been markedly refined.

"Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine Project Summary Cardiac surgery has been a highly innovative field of medicine. The introduction of major innovations, and ongoing incremental change in existing ones, have extended survival and improved quality of life for many patients suffering from cardiac disease. A rapid pace of innovation requires a rigorous infrastructure for clinical evaluation that provides timely assessments of the value of new and modified treatments. The Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) was created to provide a rigorous evidence base tor the surgical treatment of cardiothoracic disease. The International Center for Health Outcomes and Innovation Research (InCHOIR) enthusiastically embraces the opportunity to continue to work in partnership with clinical investigators and the NIH as the CTSN DCC. The Network has developed a rich research agenda for the renewal that includes trials of novel neuroprotective agents, long-term antithrombotic strategies, new regenerative medicine therapies, and surgical approaches to valvular disease, heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Given our long-standing interest and experience in the design and analysis of cardiac surgery multicenter studies, we are in a strong position to serve as the coordinating center for this vital clinical research effort. In particular, we will provide leadership in designing novel trials that optimize sample size, include patient- centered as well as clinical endpoints, and collect data from a variety of sources, including electronic data capture systems, mobile apps and wearable sensors, registries and electronic health records. We have a strong track record of obtaining efficient regulatory approval for our trials from the FDA and Health Canada, training and monitoring sites nationally and internationally, ensuring robust enrollment and retention, data management and quality assurance, data sharing, and overall administrative coordination. We have the infrastructure to expand our trials to include mechanistic studies that use biospecimens collected and managed through the CTSN biorepository. Finally, the DCC plays an important role in the analysis, interpretation and dissemination of research findings. We will continue to support the process of publishing in high-impact journals that should lead to revision of practice guidelines and to surgical practice itself. This goal should be further optimized by incorporating Implementation Science approaches into Network trials, which should decrease the well-recognized gap between publication of trial results and adoption of findings into widespread practice. NARRATIVE Clinical trials are a critical step in translating discoveries into better treatments for people burdened by cardiac disorders. Such trials typically require cooperation and coordination among a broad range of investigators, patients, government agencies, and industry partners. The objective of the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) is to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of clinical research through shared infrastructure for important trials that will advance therapy for patients suffering from cardiac disease.",Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine,9914111,U01HL088942,"['Address', 'Administrative Coordination', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Ancillary Study', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Canada', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Management Resources', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Industry', 'Information Technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Manuscripts', 'Mediation', 'Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Secure', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Site', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical center', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'data quality', 'data sharing', 'design', 'dissemination research', 'electronic data', 'electronic data capture system', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'international center', 'large datasets', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'performance site', 'prospective', 'quality assurance', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'research data dissemination', 'screening', 'tool', 'trial design', 'wearable sensor technology']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2020,7231781,415711940,-0.006281628722029077
"Application of Advanced Quantitative Methods to Schizophrenia Research in Macedonia PROJECT SUMMARY  Abnormalities of white matter are important in schizophrenia. A preponderance of studies have found decreased levels of transcripts for myelin-related proteins in autopsy brains. Some have found decrease in the proteins themselves, and some have not. Hundreds of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have found reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in the brains of many people with schizophrenia (SCH). Decreased FA is interpreted as disruption of normal architecture. However, postmortem examination has failed to identify characteristic abnormalities. This suggests that abnormalities are subtle, and perhaps postmortem examinations have not used the right tools to find them. We have therefore been developing, as part of a collaboration supported by our concluding Fogarty project, two new methods to characterize white matter at high resolution. The first is a machine learning protocol to measure axonal diameters and myelin sheath thickness in electron microscope (EM) images of prefrontal white matter, recognizing and avoiding artifacts in EM of autopsy tissue. This will enable us to measure thousands of fibers in EM images produced as part of our concluding Fogarty project, from individuals with SCH, major depressive disorder (MDD), or no psychiatric illness (NPI). The second method, suggested by the DTI findings, is to analyze the arrangement of the axons themselves. We will use 3-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of high-resolution images of the axons themselves, identified by Bielschowsky silver stain or immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated neurofilament protein. To obtain high-resolution images of Bielschowsy stains, we will take advantage of the recent observation by Dr. Mark Sonders, co-investigator on this project, that these and other heavy metal stains luminesce under 2-photon infrared excitation. This yields clear and measurable images of individual axons. We will perform these procedures on sections from existing paraffin blocks that comprise a complete left prefrontal coronal section from 36 triads containing 1 case each of SCH, MDD, or NPI, matched for sex and age. These brains were included in earlier studies that yielded data on protein composition, mRNA for myelin-related proteins, DNA methylation, microglial activation, and semiquantitative myelin histology. In a third, exploratory aim, we will employ graphical models to combine these various types of data with known properties of CNS white matter and myelin to build a model of what is disturbed in schizophrenia. We expect that novel techniques for data fusion will reveal associations based on multidimensional correlations that could not be detected by modeling the single-domain datasets separately. In the process of completing these scientific aims, we will pursue the pedagogic goals of training the first two professional biostatisticians in Macedonia, and an academic pathologist. We will also hold a seminar course for biological researchers to build awareness and understanding of the power of biostatistical and other computational methods to enrich their research. NARRATIVE Our ongoing Fogarty/NIMH research project in Macedonia (R01 MH060877, “Building Schizophrenia Research in Macedonia”), has demonstrated biochemical abnormalities of white matter in schizophrenia that are not present in major depressive disorder. However, we have not seen anatomical abnormalities of white matter, which MRI studies of schizophrenia tell us should exist, and as the biochemistry also suggests. To explore white matter in novel ways, we are developing new methods of microscopy, image analysis and statistical inference, which we now propose to employ on a large scale.",Application of Advanced Quantitative Methods to Schizophrenia Research in Macedonia,9953486,R56MH117769,"['3-Dimensional', 'Academy', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Autopsy', 'Awareness', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscope', 'Electrons', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Macedonia', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Multiomic Data', 'Myelin', 'Myelin Sheath', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurofilament Proteins', 'Paraffin', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Silver Staining', 'Stains', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structural Models', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translational Research', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'deep neural network', 'diffusion anisotropy', 'high resolution imaging', 'histological image', 'histological studies', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'interest', 'low and middle-income countries', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'novel', 'pedagogy', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'tool', 'two photon microscopy', 'two-photon', 'water diffusion', 'white matter']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R56,2019,10000,68331629,-0.03376519101845943
"Sequencing and Genotyping in Diverse Populations:  Who Wants What Back (and When)? PROJECT SUMMARY The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a national annual mid-sized conference series held in Cleveland, Ohio. The conference series aims to serve as a venue for the continuing education and exchange of scientific ideas related to the rapidly evolving and highly interdisciplinary landscape that is precision medicine research. The topics for each conference coincide with the national conversation and research agenda set by national research programs focused on precision medicine. The 2018 conference is a symposium that will focus on issues related to return of genomic results both in clinical and research settings with an emphasis on diverse populations. The conference will be organized as a traditional format with invited speakers from among national experts for topics ranging from issues returning research results to culturally diverse participants and family members, inclusion of diverse patient and participant populations in the Clinical Sequencing Evidence- Generating Research (CSER) consortium and the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program, pharmacogenomics-guided dosing and race/ethnicity, strategies used to return results, among others. 2019 and beyond conference topics are being considered from previous symposia attendees and trends in precision medicine research. Odd-numbered year conferences include a workshop component that has previously covered outcome and exposure variable extraction from electronic health records. Future workshop topics being considered include integration of multiple ‘omics, drug response in different populations, pharmacogenomics clinical implementation, precision medicine in cancer, data sharing and informed consent, and the use of apps for recruitment, diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment. Our second major objective of this conference series is the promotion of diversity in the biomedical workforce. It is well-known that the pipeline from training to full professor for women in biomedical research is leaky whereas the pipeline for under-represented minorities is practically non-existent. Drawing from national and local sources, we vet women and under-represented minorities for every invited speaker opportunity, thereby providing valuable career currency and networking opportunities. We will also encourage women and under-represented minorities, particularly at the trainee level, to attend and participate in this conference series to spur interest in pursuing precision medicine research as a career. Overall, the North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine series is a valuable addition to the national conference landscape, and with its unique location and low cost to participants, will serve as an important educational opportunity as precision medicine research accelerates in earnest. PROJECT NARRATIVE The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a yearly fall conference series in Cleveland, Ohio designed as a continuing education forum in the burgeoning area of precision medicine research.

"Medical Image Perception Society XVIII Conference MIPS XVIII brings together an international community of experts including radiologists, pathologists, other image-based clinicians, psychologists, statisticians, physicists, engineers, and computer scientists investigating the extraction of diagnostic information from medical images. The meeting forges research and learning opportunities for new students and young researchers in a dedicated forum unmatched by other meetings. MIPS XVIII is being organized by the Medical Image Perception Society (a US-based society; Elizabeth Krupinski, PhD President) in conjunction with local hosts Trafton Drew, PhD (University of Utah Psychology) and William Auffermann, MD, PhD (University of Utah Radiology); and committee Lauren Williams (University of Utah) trainee member, David Alonso trainee member (University of Utah). It will run July 14-17, 2019 at the University of Utah Guest House & Conference Center located near the University of Utah campus. Nine topic areas have been selected for MIPS XVIII, reflecting important dimensions of medical image interpretation. This year’s special focus theme is addressing other image-based specialties outside radiology. Studying how clinicians extract diagnostic information from images identifies the causes of missed diagnoses and ways to eliminate these errors. Careful design and evaluation of imaging systems are critical in view of their enormous costs. With the current emphasis in the practice of medicine on “meaningful use” and “accountable care” to improve the quality, safety, and efficiency of care, the role the clinician as decision-maker cannot be ignored. Medical image perception research develops and applies modern methods to the evaluation of observer performance in diagnostic imaging tasks. Understanding basic aspects of the perception of medical images can reduce diagnostic error and improve medical decision-making quality. This grant will support 10 students to attend and present their research at MIPS XVIII. To date, 115 students have been awarded scholarships. The primary goal in supporting these students is to create opportunities and offer supportive mentoring at this formative stage in the trainee’s career to enhance their research potential and likelihood of success. The meeting brings together researchers investigating the process of extracting diagnostic information from medical images to render accurate and efficient diagnostic decisions. Opportunities for advanced, interdisciplinary training of young scientists interested in medical image perception research and its relevance to disease prevention and treatment are often quite limited at the university level. Since 1997, 115 students have been awarded MIPS scholarships, having a significant impact on the field by creating opportunities and offering supportive mentoring at this formative stage in the trainee’s career to enhance their research potential and likelihood of success as independent basic science and clinician-scientist researchers.",Medical Image Perception Society XVIII Conference,9833051,R13EB028683,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'American', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malpractice', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modern Medicine', 'Modernization', 'Ophthalmology', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physician&apos', 's Role', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Psychophysics', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Scholarship', 'Scientist', 'Societies', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Work', 'automobile accident', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'health care quality', 'image processing', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'medical specialties', 'meetings', 'member', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'radiologist', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'whole slide imaging']",NIBIB,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R13,2019,10000,507546965,-0.019896112061980713
"Machine Learning in Breast Parenchyma and Tumor Characterization for Cancer Risk Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY We propose a study of radiomic texture analysis in terms of robustness assessment and classification utility. We will introduce novel robustness metrics geared towards assessment of radiomic features in comparison across two image conditions, and apply these metrics to study feature robustness across imaging parameters and patient biology. In addressing the utility of radiomic features in cancer risk assessment, we will identify and evaluate texture signatures from mammography and tomosynthesis datasets. The field of radiomics is evolving fast, and quantitative texture analysis is being applied to a growing number of applications in medical imaging. By performing a thorough investigation of the robustness of these radiomic features to dataset heterogeneities we aim to identify the strengths and weaknesses of commonly used features to guide their implementations on future applications.  Two clinical tasks will be studied under the proposed research: 1) risk assessment and cancer prediction and 2) malignancy evaluation. Multiple modalities including tomosynthesis, mammography and MRI will be involved in studies geared towards addressing these clinical questions. An evaluation of the robustness of commonly employed radiomic features will help guide the field of medical texture analysis and contribute to meaningful conclusions in future studies throughout the field of quantitative image analysis. The first aim of the proposed research involves the proposition and evaluation of novel robustness metrics for investigations lacking a classification task. The second aim will extend the study of radiomics to investigate the utility of robust features in classification tasks and identification of texture signatures relate to biomedical characteristics. The third aim will build upon the two previous aims and culminate in the application of cutting-edge technologies in machine learning and deep learning in further promoting image processing in the field of medical physics. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of the proposed research is to evaluate and improve the application of radiomic texture features in cancer risk assessment. We will accomplish this by evaluating the robustness of various radiomic metrics, testing the classification utility of texture features in clinical tasks, and extending current classification methods to include cutting-edge developments in machine learning technology. Careful preliminary studies have demonstrated methods for selection of robust texture features and improvement in classification tasks by emphasizing feature robustness in feature selection methodology and we therefore believe that a meticulous evaluation of the impact of imaging parameters on feature calculations will lead to overall improvement of computer-aided diagnosis and clinical translation to progress in cancer screening protocols.",Machine Learning in Breast Parenchyma and Tumor Characterization for Cancer Risk Assessment,9683697,F31CA228247,"['Address', 'Benign', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impact evaluation', 'Incidence', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening for cancer', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'cancer risk', 'clinical translation', 'deep learning', 'expectation', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'molecular subtypes', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'response', 'tomosynthesis', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F31,2019,24304,246330700,-0.04158697272092693
"A Real-Time Computational System for Detecting ARDS Using Ventilator Waveform Data Project Summary:  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe form of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure affecting 10% of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in the United States. In-hospital mortality of 35-46% has been reported across the spectrum of mild-severe ARDS, and one third of patients with initially mild ARDS will progress to moderate or severe ARDS. Over the last 20 years, multiple studies have reported improved outcomes for ARDS patients using specific ARDS targeted therapies. However, ARDS remains persistently under-recognized and challenging to diagnose. Only one third of ICU providers correctly identify ARDS on the first day when diagnostic criteria are met, and less than two thirds ever recognize the diagnosis in the ICU. This under recognition of ARDS may prevent some patients from receiving lifesaving therapies necessary for treating the disease. Attempts to automate ARDS diagnosis using rule- based algorithms have seen limited success, and require analysis of subjective data from patient histories, like chest scans, which limit diagnosis automation, timeliness, and study reproducibility.  To improve the current state of the art of ARDS detection technology, we intend to utilize objective and readily available data including both ventilator waveform data, (VWD) and electronic health record (EMR) data to 1) improve the recognition of ARDS, and 2) identify high-risk ARDS patients most likely to benefit from additional ARDS treatments. For this task, we will make use of an existing dataset of VWD from over 500 patients receiving mechanical ventilation, including 156 patients with confirmed ARDS. Our preliminary analyses using a machine learned model and a subset of lung physiology features derived solely from VWD, suggest that ARDS can be diagnosed in the absence of a chest scan or medical history. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will improve our existing model used for discriminating ARDS by adding objective EMR data, and additional features extracted from VWD, such as patient respiratory compliance and airway resistance. Our next focus will be to predict worsening of ARDS severity in intubated patients based on Berlin criteria. So in Aim 2, we will evaluate the best tools for predicting increases in ARDS severity, and which types of temporal information yield the best predictive results.  We hypothesize that model development using additional objective data derived from VWD analysis and the EMR, along with advanced analytic techniques, will further improve ARDS diagnosis, and enable the prediction of clinical trajectories in patients with ARDS. The proposed work will yield innovative clinical decision support models that can be used to improve the state of the art in automated ARDS diagnosis. Our predictive modeling will also enable greater insight into the times when physicians can perform clinical interventions to arrest ARDS induced physiologic deterioration. Ultimately, these innovations could save lives by quickly detecting ARDS, and alerting physicians to begin or intensify ARDS focused therapies based on patient pathophysiologic state. Project Narrative: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a highly lethal disease contracted by over 100,000 Americans each year. We seek to address whether we can create automated technologies to detect onset and change in severity of ARDS in critically ill patients using widely available ventilator waveform data. With these automated diagnostic testing technologies, doctors can promptly deliver necessary treatments for ARDS before the disease worsens.",A Real-Time Computational System for Detecting ARDS Using Ventilator Waveform Data,9882887,F31HL144028,"['Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Airway Resistance', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automation', 'Berlin', 'Chest', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Contracts', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Model', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hour', 'Hypoxemia', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical History', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States', 'Ventilator', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'deep learning', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'markov model', 'model development', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'recurrent neural network', 'respiratory', 'success', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,F31,2019,37193,254622553,-0.0022304264672789622
"Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (MiEED) PROJECT SUMMARY In this application, I am requesting support from a career development award to support my research proposal titled “Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction”. I will be undertaking this work with the mentorship of Dr. Jeffrey Gordon (Primary US mentor) at the Washington University, St Louis and Dr. Asad Ali (Primary LMIC mentor) at the Aga Khan University. This project builds on our existing studies of Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED), funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The current application aims to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of EED by studying the evolution of gut microbial configuration in children who have clinical and histological evidence of EED. EED is common in children living in impoverished conditions with limited access to clean drinking water and sanitation. Histopathological changes of EED in small bowel mucosa include alteration in crypt to villous ratio along with lymphocytic infiltration of the villous epithelium and lamina propria. Although studies involving biopsies of small bowel mucosa are critical to study EED, these studies are uncommon because of logistic challenges involving performing endoscopies in field settings in LMICs. We have previously demonstrated in an ongoing BMGF funded study that we are able to safely obtain such biopsies, we now have a unique opportunity to study the relationship between gut microbiome evolution and EED in this cohort. The central hypothesis of the current application is that children with histological confirmation of EED have shared features of a bacterial community which is different from healthy controls and non-EED subjects, and that such changes in bacterial configuration are associated with enteric and systemic inflammation. For testing these hypotheses, evaluation of gut microbiome in healthy and stunted children will be carried out to identify the age discriminatory bacterial taxa in children with and without confirmation of EED. Dr. Gordon will be providing mentorship and experience in gut microbiome and microbiota analysis. Dr. Ali will provide the needed infrastructure of the field site and laboratory facilities, along with linking the microbiome analysis with clinical and histological outcomes of interest. The Aga Khan University is a leading regional research institute with multiple support systems for junior investigators which will be vital for my career transition as an independent scientist. My long term goal is to be the principal investigator of my own laboratory, focusing on studying the gut microbiome and its relationship with communicable and non-communicable diseases. I envision working on microbiota derived therapy for EED, and to find targets in the inflammatory pathways driven by changes in gut homeostasis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Globally, Pakistan has the third highest rate of stunting among children aged < 5 years. Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED) is proposed to be a critical factor responsible for chronic growth faltering in children in resource limited settings. This research utilizes an innovative approach to study a program of postnatal gut microbiome development in children and its impact on child growth. This proposal will provide an ideal training platform for a translational scientist, covering the domains of mucosal immunology, histopathology, computational analysis, microbiome analysis and host immune responses. The skills learnt from this project will be critical for the capacity development of both the LMIC institution and the candidate herself.","Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (MiEED)",9712985,K43TW010697,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Bangladesh', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Career Mobility', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Duodenum', 'Endoscopy', 'Enteral', 'Epithelium', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Gut Mucosa', 'Height', 'Histologic', 'Histopathologic Grade', 'Histopathology', 'Homeostasis', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Impairment', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lamina Propria', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Milieu Therapy', 'Modeling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Pakistan', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Small Intestines', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Sustainable Development', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Villous', 'Washington', 'Weight', 'Work', 'aged', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cytokine', 'drinking water', 'enteric pathogen', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'fecal microbiota', 'global health', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'host microbiome', 'immune activation', 'immune function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intestinal villi', 'laboratory facility', 'learning strategy', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiota', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'rRNA Genes', 'random forest', 'skills', 'translational scientist']",FIC,AGA KHAN UNIVERSITY (PAKISTAN),K43,2019,64933,282635,-0.029851111826985303
"Chronic Inflammation and Type 2 Diabetes: A Multi-omics Approach ABSTRACT The etiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D) likely involves a complex interaction of polygenic, metabolic, and environmental factors including diet. Accumulating experimental, epidemiological, and clinical evidence supports a pathogenic role of chronic inflammation in T2D development. However, the precise mechanisms underlying these findings are largely unknown, and current evidence on the causal relationships between specific inflammatory pathways and T2D risk is inconclusive. Advances in omics technologies have led to the identification of genes and metabolites associated with T2D risk, but data on mechanisms and causality are still very limited. Multi-omics integration in the framework of systems epidemiology may provide new avenues to enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms. To systematically investigate the relation between chronic inflammation and T2D, I propose to examine 3 Specific Aims by leveraging the rich resources in the UK Biobank, Nurses’ Health Studies (NHS), Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (SOL), and Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx). In Aim 1 [K99], I will integrate existing genomic data from the UK Biobank, NHS/HPFS, SOL, and transcriptomic data in the GTEx to examine shared genetic architectures between systemic inflammatory markers and T2D and whether polygenic susceptibility to chronic inflammation confers T2D risk. Meanwhile, I will receive extensive training in T2D systems biology and cutting-edge high-dimensional data analytics and bioinformatics. In Aim 2 [R00], I will integrate dietary and metabolomic data to examine metabolomic profiles mediating the association between dietary inflammatory potentials and T2D risk in the prospective NHS/HPFS and the SOL. In Aim 3 [R00], I will conduct plasma proteomic profiling in a nested case-control study within the NHS to identify inflammatory protein networks in relation to T2D risk, and as a Secondary Aim, integrate findings from Aim 1-3 to explore T2D-related pathways co-regulating at multiple biological dimensions. Findings from this project may improve the understanding of inflammatory mechanisms underlying T2D and identify novel targets/pathways suitable for early detection and prevention. I will be mentored/advised by an interdisciplinary team that includes Dr. JoAnn Manson (diabetes epidemiologist), Dr. Liming Liang (expert in statistical omics methodologies), Dr. Frank Hu (nutritional epidemiologist), Dr. Peter Kraft, (statistical geneticist), Dr. Qibin Qi (genetic epidemiologist), Dr. Towia Libermann (expert in proteomics), and Dr. Clary Clish (expert in metabolomics). The outstanding training opportunities with key leaders in these areas will provide me advanced knowledge and skills, positioning me for a successful, independent career as a diabetes epidemiologist with expertise in systems biology and integrated-omics. This project aligns with the NIDDK’s goal of integrating multi-omics technologies into diabetes research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to systematically examine the relationship between chronic inflammation and type 2 diabetes (T2D) by incorporating multi-omics data from several large prospective cohort studies. The proposed research will yield novel evidence on the biological mechanisms underlying the relationship between chronic inflammation and T2D risk. Novel pathways, and specific genes, proteins, and metabolites identified in this research will serve as the critical first steps for future development of biomarkers and therapeutic targets for T2D prevention and treatment.",Chronic Inflammation and Type 2 Diabetes: A Multi-omics Approach,9805982,K99DK122128,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Diet', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Food', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos', 'IL6 gene', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intake', 'Interleukin-6', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Limes', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Nutritional', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Qi', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Study of Latinos', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'TNFRSF1A gene', 'Technology', 'Training', 'White Blood Cell Count procedure', 'Work', 'adiponectin', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker development', 'cardiometabolism', 'career', 'case control', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'diabetes risk', 'disorder prevention', 'genetic architecture', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'i(19)', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'response', 'skills', 'therapeutic target', 'training opportunity', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K99,2019,91499,146629556,-0.015791549756330053
"Integrative data science approaches for rare disease discovery in health records ABSTRACT: There are nearly 7,000 diseases that have a prevalence of only one in 2,000 individuals or less. Yet, such rare diseases are estimated to collectively affect over 300 million people worldwide, representing a significant healthcare concern. Although rare diseases have predominantly genetic origins, nearly half of them do not manifest symptoms until adulthood and frequently confound discovery and diagnosis. Even in the case of early onset disorders, the sheer number of possible diagnoses can often overwhelm clinicians. As a result, rare diseases are often diagnosed with delay, misdiagnosed or even remain undiagnosed, not only disrupting patient lives but also hindering progress on our understanding of such diseases. Data science methods that mine large-scale retrospective health record data for phenotypic information will aid in timely and accurate diagnoses of rare diseases, especially when combined with additional data types, thus, having significant real- world impact. This proposal will integrate electronic health record (EHR) data sets with publicly available vocabularies and ontologies, and genomic data for the improved identification and characterization of patients with rare diseases, using approaches from machine learning, natural language processing (NLP) and basic bioinformatics. The work has three specific aims and will be carried out in two phases. During the mentored phase, the principal investigator (PI) will develop data-driven methods to extract standardized concepts related to rare diseases from clinical notes and infer the occurrence of each disease (Aim 1). He will also develop data science approaches to compare and contrast longitudinal patterns associated with patients' journeys through the healthcare system when seeking a diagnosis for a rare disease, and aid in clinical decision-making by leveraging these patterns (Aim 2). During the independent phase (Aim 3), computational methods will be developed for the integrated modeling and analysis of genotypic (from Aim 3) and phenotypic information (from Aims 1 and 2). Cohorts to be sequenced will cover diseases for which causal genes or disease definitions are unclear (discovery), as well as those for which these are well known (validation). This work will be carried out under the mentorship of four faculty members with complementary expertise in biomedical informatics, data science, NLP, and rare disease genomics at the University of Washington, the largest medical system in the Pacific Northwest (four million EHRs), world-renowned researchers in medical genetics, and a robust data science environment. In addition, under the direction of the mentoring team, the PI will complete advanced coursework, receive training in translational bioinformatics and clinical research informatics, submit manuscripts, and seek an independent research position. This proposal will yield preliminary results for subsequent studies on data-driven phenotyping and enable the realization of the PI's career goals by providing him with the necessary training to build on his machine learning and basic bioinformatics expertise to transition into an independent investigator in biomedical data science. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare genetic diseases are estimated to affect the lives of 25 to 30 million Americans and their families, and present a significant economic burden on the healthcare system. Currently, our knowledge of the broad spectrum of the 7,000 observed rare diseases is limited to a few well-studied ones, hindering our ability to make correct and timely diagnoses. The objective of this study is to improve the identification of patients with rare diseases in healthcare systems by developing data science approaches that automatically recognize rare disease-related patterns in patient health records and correlate them with genomic data, thus, aiding in diagnosis and discovery.",Integrative data science approaches for rare disease discovery in health records,9645433,K99LM012992,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Markov Chains', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pacific Northwest', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Rare Diseases', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'Washington', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'causal variant', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease phenotype', 'early onset disorder', 'exome sequencing', 'gene discovery', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'health record', 'improved', 'member', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'open source', 'phenotypic data', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'rare condition', 'rare genetic disorder', 'recruit', 'skills', 'software development', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trait']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2019,92070,533302350,-0.017331962271252273
"Real-time Non-Rigid 3D Reconstruction and Registration for Laparoscopic-guided Minimally Invasive Liver Surgery Project Summary/Abstract Liver deformation leads to difficulties in tumor localization during minimally invasive liver surgery (MILS). The goal of this proposal is to develop an efficient surgical navigation tool for MILS by compensating for liver deformation and mapping preoperative data to the patient’s anatomy. Specifically, we will develop a non-rigid simultaneously localization and mapping (SLAM) approach to estimate the deformation of liver surface from stereo laparoscopy videos. We will develop machine-learning methods to detect landmarks and perform non- rigid registration. The algorithms will be implemented on a GPU to achieve real-time. Preliminary data has demonstrated the feasibility. During the R00 phase, we will mainly address the clinical needs and develop novel ways to provide intraoperative guidance. This project will greatly improve the tumor resection accuracy in MILS. The candidate for this award Dr. Haoyin Zhou is a postdoc at Surgical Planning Laboratory (SPL), Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) and Harvard Medical School (HMS). Dr. Zhou has extensive experience and expertise in computer vision, machine learning and their applications in medicine. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. National Center for Image Guided Therapy, and Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided Operating (AMIGO) suite will greatly support this research. Dr. Zhou’s long-term research goal is to develop and apply advanced computer vision and machine learning technologies to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of medical image processing and image-guided therapy.

"MRI and machine learning to improve early prognosis and clinical management after spinal cord injury PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Purpose/Hypothesis: Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes substantial social, economic, and health burden.1 For individuals with motor incomplete SCI, some basic ability to stand or walk is expected during the recovery process,2 and this is a top priority in rehabilitative programs.3 However, establishing a prognosis for recovering community walking ability is extremely difficult.4 Within 72 hours after SCI,5 edema develops within the damaged spinal cord. This edema is a hallmark of spinal cord injury, expressed as signal hyperintensity using T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).6 Correlations between the sagittal length of this spinal cord edema and walking ability are generally poor.7,8 However, advanced but available high resolution axial T2-weighted MRI to quantify spinal cord edema in people in the acute stage of SCI may improve prediction of walking ability.9,10 The early clinical management and targeted rehabilitation of these individuals could be drastically enhanced, optimizing recovery and rehabilitation outcomes. The main objective of this research project is to use early axial spinal cord MRI sequences as neuroprognostic biomarkers to improve the prediction of residual motor function. This objective will be realized by the implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: To establish to what extent the axial damage ratio biomarker, measured by high-resolution axial T2-weighted structural imaging, can predict residual function in persons with SCI. Previously-collected axial T2-weighted spinal cord structural MRI data of 200 people with SCI from the US Model SCI System at Craig Hospital will be used to quantify cord damage. This metric will be related to the primary 1-year status-post injury outcome measures, which are clinical records of walking ability and function. Multivariate statistical analyses will be applied to create exploratory models to determine the prognostic value of the MRI measures. We hypothesize that the axial damage ratio can be used in the acute stage as an accurate and objective neuroprognostic biomarker of residual motor function. Aim 2: To identify the relationship between damage to specific spinal cord regions and specific motor and sensory deficits. MRI data from Aim 1 will be used. Spinal cord regional damage analysis will be related to right and left upper and lower extremity motor and sensory scores. Correlational statistical analyses will be applied to analyze relationships between specific tract damage and motor/sensory deficits. We hypothesize that damage to descending lateral corticospinal motor regions is related to ipsilesional motor deficits, and that similar findings exist for ascending sensory regions and sensory deficits. For both Aims, we will compare our manual damage quantification to our machine learning approach to automatically detect spinal cord damage. Aim 3: Develop, test, and distribute a machine-learning based analysis pipeline for spinal cord damage measures. We will use functions included in the Spinal Cord Toolbox and the open-source NiftyNet deep-learning platform to develop the machine-learning based analysis pipeline. The processing steps will include spinal cord detection, spinal cord damage segmentation, registration to the spinal cord template, and the calculation and output of the axial damage ratio and regional damage biomarkers. Significance: Successful completion of these Aims will advance the NIH/NICHD NCMRR aim: “to enhance the health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of people with physical disabilities.” The significance of this outcome relates directly to improving the clinical management of SCI. This research may inform clinicians, patients, and families, regarding the percentage chance of regaining walking ability. The healthcare team will be able to determine, early-on, which people will optimally respond to locomotor training. This work will significantly improve the prognosis for recovery of walking and specific motor/sensory function based on early imaging of the damaged spinal cord. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this research project is to use early axial MRI measures of spinal cord damage as objective biomarkers to improve the prediction of walking recovery and specific motor return of individuals following SCI. This research will provide patients with a quantified sense of expectations regarding their chances of walking recovery, and will help guide the healthcare team on the best options for clinical management and rehabilitation (i.e. focusing on neuroplasticity and restoration of walking versus compensatory strategies). Ultimately, this research aims to improve the lives and wellbeing of those suffering from spinal cord injury. Successful completion of this research will advance the NIH/NICHD NCMRR aim: “to enhance the health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of people with physical disabilities.” ! 1!",MRI and machine learning to improve early prognosis and clinical management after spinal cord injury,9674165,R03HD094577,"['Acute', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communities', 'Correlation Studies', 'Corticospinal Tracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Edema', 'Event', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Lateral', 'Left', 'Length', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Location', 'Locomotor training', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Team', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical Function', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Quality of life', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rogaine', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord damage', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Testing', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Extremity', 'Walking', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dorsal column', 'early detection biomarkers', 'expectation', 'functional independence', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'motor deficit', 'motor function recovery', 'motor recovery', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'prospective', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'restoration', 'secondary outcome', 'social', 'spinal cord imaging']",NICHD,REGIS UNIVERSITY,R03,2019,96034,52775,-0.004009010513362908
"Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis Abstract The target users of the proposed Slicer+PLUS framework are researchers and developers who are focusing on low-cost point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications. POCUS applications are characterized by utilizing low-cost, portable U/S systems; in the hands of novice operators; with novel data acquisition, signal processing, and machine learning methods; with imprecise trackers; and in highly unconstrained point-of-care environments, e.g.: at the scene of accidents for patient triage, in the offices of general practitioners for scoliosis detection and monitoring, in patients' homes for an aging population, as well as throughout hospitals. In these contexts, many are considering POCUS devices to be the stethoscopes of the future.  The foundation of Slicer+PLUS is the integration and extension of 3D Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. We are the developers of these libraries. We, and the users of our libraries, are proposing Slicer+PLUS so that the Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC communities can come together and cohesively address the important challenges and opportunities posed by POCUS applications. Over 30 letters of support are included with this application.  3D Slicer is a world-class, freely available open-source platform for medical image segmentation, registration, and visualization. PLUS is a world-class, open-source library for communicating with ultrasound machines and trackers (for following objects in 3D using magnetic, optical, and other technologies). MUSiiC is a (previously closed source) library that focuses on advanced ultrasound acquisition and analysis methods, such as ultrasound reconstruction pipelines, elastography, and photoacoustic imaging. Together, these toolkits have averaged over 5,100 downloads per month for the past year.  A central tenant of our work is that POCUS applications should not be viewed as simply involving the use of inexpensive, portable U/S systems; POCUS must be viewed as a new modality for it to attain its full potential. POCUS must involve innovative, automated data analysis methods and workflows that can guide a user to properly place and manipulate an ultrasound probe and interpret the returned ultrasound data. In particular, the output of those workflows and analyses should be quantitative measures, not b-mode images, since the expertise to interpret such images will not be readily available at points-of-care. To that end, the proposed work goes well beyond simple integration of Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. Multiple innovations are proposed such as Ultrasound Spectroscopy for tissue labeling, Dynamic Textures for anatomic localization of ultrasound probes, and self-tracking ultrasound probes.  To assess our progress towards our goals, our team includes our target users: researchers, medical device manufacturers, and clinical innovators dedicated to low-cost POCUS applications. They will be validating our efforts by integrating them into their research and translational POCUS product development projects. Project Narrative  Low-cost ultrasound probes have the potential to become the stethoscopes of the future and revolutionize in-field and in-hospital patient care. Our goal is to integrate, enhance, and disseminate three cutting edge ultrasound acquisition, analysis, and display toolkits to create a new framework called Slicer+PLUS that will serve as a catalyst for research and product development into low-cost point-of-care ultrasound applications. In particular, our framework will include and facilitate innovative methods for guiding a novice user in ultrasound probe placement and for automatically interpreting ultrasound data to provide a diagnosis, without the user having to interpret a traditional B-mode ultrasound image at any point in the process. The Slicer+PLUS framework will be validated using tasks associated with (a) emergency service personnel performing Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exams at the scene of an accident to detect or rule-out intra-abdominal bleeding; (b) the clinical monitoring of scoliosis progression in children in general practitioners' offices; and (c) the translation of research into regulatory-approved products based on Slicer+PLUS.","Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis",9750736,R01EB021396,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Accidents', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blood', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intervention', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stethoscopes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'catalyst', 'clinical translation', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data pipeline', 'elastography', 'emergency service responder', 'hospital patient care', 'image guided therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'off-label use', 'open source', 'photoacoustic imaging', 'point of care', 'portability', 'product development', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'scoliosis', 'signal processing', 'software development', 'transmission process']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R01,2019,100000,5161939,0.008341817331784556
"Automated Diagnosis and Progression Rate of IPF Using HRCT Project Summary: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of unknown etiology occurring in older adults. IPF is ultimately fatal with a median survival of 2 to 5 years, and exhibits a highly heterogeneous natural history. Broad categories of disease progression have been defined, but are not predictable at the time of diagnosis. Diagnosis and stratification of disease phenotypes are important in order to decipher the effects of novel therapies among individuals with biologically dissimilar natural histories and to better tailor therapy to individuals. Few computerized diagnostic tools have been developed for IPF that correlate with visual and surgical lung biopsy; most use clinical and functional variables independent of imaging findings. Prognostic determinants based on imaging features rely largely on subjective visual assessment of disease. In contrast, no good predictive models with localized region exist that anticipate the natural history of disease in advance of significant functional decline. Given the indispensable role of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in the diagnosis and surveillance of IPF, we propose to mine the rich information in HRCT data sets to develop robust, quantitative features that can anticipate disease progression in advance of debilitating respiratory compromise. We propose to use as a derivative dataset the anonymized clinical data and source images on 234 patients with IPF and 266 patients with IPF suspected, but not IPF based on HRCT and the surgical biopsy who have participated in multicenter trials, and whose data are archived at the UCLA Computer Vision and Imaging Biomarkers Laboratory. Using an image processing pipeline developed in our laboratory for high through-put quantitative image analysis, we will train a classifier with features of anatomic distribution and reproducible imaging features expressed with a quantitative lung fibrosis (QLF) score, testing on separate data from in an independent institutional registry of clinical and image data on patients with IPF seen in the UCLA Interstitial Lung Disease Program. Furthermore, the second aim is to develop a rate of progression at local region and to aggregate predictive models using Cox proportional regression models, which will be derived using only clinical covariates and combined clinical and imaging covariates, correlating these models with progression free survival. Our objectives are centered on the goals of using preexisting datasets to develop clinically meaningful models that diagnose and anticipate disease course in patients with IPF and subdividing patients into more homogeneous groups prior to the development of significant respiratory impairment. We anticipate that models can be used clinically at the individual patient level to enable more informed and timely management decisions to define more homogeneous cohorts for purposes of testing new targeted therapies and to better elucidate the effects of therapies in patients with biologically heterogeneous disease progression. Relevance to Public Health: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of older adults that now has a few treatment options: The natural history of IPF and its rate of progression is highly variables, which hampers timely decisions about referral for lung transplantation or treatments using new drug therapies. This research takes advantage of clinical and imaging datasets previously collected for research or clinical purposes, and will define image features using computer analysis of computed tomography (CT) images to diagnose and predict disease course robustly in advance of respiratory deterioration. The success of this research will enable us to distinguish between patients with IPF and non-IPF with reducing chance of lung biopsy and predict slowly versus rapidly progressive disease, leading to more time to treat patients and timely management decisions, and may help us to understand which patients might benefit from novel promising therapies or treatments and which may not.",Automated Diagnosis and Progression Rate of IPF Using HRCT,9765383,R21HL140465,"['Acute', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Archives', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease stratification', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Laboratories', 'Lobar', 'Lobe', 'Lung', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Natural History', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathology', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Progressive Disease', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stable Disease', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'data archive', 'digital imaging', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'functional decline', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'pulmonary function', 'quantitative imaging', 'respiratory', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2019,113241,673201228,-0.009238579421380568
"Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The uveitides are a collection of ~30 distinct diseases characterized by intraocular infection. Each disease has its own features, course, treatment, and prognosis. Traditionally, the uveitides have been grouped by the primary anatomic site of inflammation as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. However, there are substantial limitations to this ""lumping"" of diseases. For example, among the posterior uveitides, some (e.g. toxoplasmic retinitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis) are infectious and require treatment with antimicrobial/antiviral agents, some are chronic, presumed immune-mediated diseases that require immunosuppression (e.g. birdshot chorioretinitis, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis), and a few are self-limited, spontaneously-remitting diseases with a good prognosis (e.g. acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome). As such precise diagnosis is critical for research, including epidemiology, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease specific clinical trials. Classification criteria are a type of ""diagnostic"" criteria used for reserch purposes. Although classification criteria seek to optimize sensitivity and specificity, when a trade-off is required, they emphasize specificity in order to ensure that a homogeneous group of patients is being studied. A precise phenotype is required particularly for genomic risk factor studies of complex disorders and translational pathogenesis research, as inclusion of other diseases with different risk factors and disease mechanisms would confound the results. Currently there are no widely-accepted and validated classification criteria for any of the uveitides. Preliminary data indicate ""fair to moderate"" agreement at best on the independent diagnosis of any one case by uveitis experts (κ's 0.27-0.40), but the ability of committees to reach agreement on the diagnosis of >98% of cases. The goal of the ""Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides"" project is for the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group to develop classification criteria for the 25 leading uveitides using a formal, rigorous approach. There are 4 phases to the project: 1) informatics, to develop a standardized terminology; 2) case collection, to develop a preliminary database of ~250 cases of each disease; 3) case selection, to select at least 150-200 cases of each disease that are generally accepted to be the disease (using formal consensus techniques) from the preliminary database into a final database; and 4) data analysis, using machine learning approaches, of the final database to develop a parsimonious set of criteria for each disease that minimizes misclassification. The informatics and case collection phases of the Project are complete. The case selection phase is well underway and uses online voting and consensus conference calls to achieve supermajority acceptance on all cases included in the final database. The goals of this application are to complete case selection and data analysis and develop classification criteria for the 25 of the major uveitides. These results are crucial to future clinical research i the field of uveitis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Collectively, the uveitides are the 5th leading cause of blindness in the U.S., and the cost of treating them is estimated to be similar to that of treating diabetic retinopathy. Because uveitis occurs in all age groups, including children and working-age adults, there is a greater potential for years of vision lost than with age- related diseases. Clinical research in the field of uveitis has been hampered by diagnostic imprecision and a lack of widely-accepted and validated classification criteria, the development of which is the goal of this application; these criteria are needed urgently to advance epidemiology, genomic research, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease-specific clinical trials.",Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides,9663961,R01EY026593,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior uveitis', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Choroiditis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intermediate Uveitis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nomenclature', 'Outcomes Research', 'Panuveitis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pigments', 'Posterior Uveitis', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Retinitis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'United States', 'Uveitis', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Voting', 'age group', 'age related', 'aging population', 'antimicrobial', 'birdshot chorioretinitis', 'cost', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web page', 'working group']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,127308,415711940,0.0014226070147043855
"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life. This research will also provide quantitative outcome measures that may be used in future clinical trials.",Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS,9722280,K01HD088762,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Equilibrium', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'FXTAS', 'Family', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuroepidemiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Posture', 'Predictive Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'data management', 'design', 'disability', 'disabling symptom', 'epidemiology study', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'gait examination', 'improved', 'instrument', 'male', 'men', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sex']",NICHD,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2019,129089,55098220,-0.007462296008268733
"Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD ABSTRACT The goal of this NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to provide an organized scientific and educational environment for Dr. Timothy Kline to begin his transition into an independent research career focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. This proposal outlines a five-year training plan at Mayo Clinic under the primary mentorship of Dr. Bradley Erickson and a Mentoring Team comprised of accomplished researchers in the fields of: biology, nephrology, genetics, radiology, informatics; medical physics, biostatistics, image processing, and physiology. The focus of this proposal is to improve both research studies and disease prognosis for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients through biomedical imaging techniques. It is well understood that imaging is essential for ADPKD diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome prediction. Clinical studies utilize total kidney volume (TKV) (as measured by MRI as an image-based biomarker) to follow the progression of ADPKD, as larger TKVs have been shown to correlate with worse prognosis in both human and animal-model studies. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming, costly, and poorly standardized. The introduction of automated approaches for measuring TKV will: greatly improve measurement throughput, significantly reduce costs associated with performing research studies, allow accurate and reproducible measurements to be obtained both within and across institutions; facilitate the search for new imaging biomarkers. The specific aims of this project are to: (i) develop and validate automated tools to characterize renal structure, such as TKV and cystic burden; (ii) explore new imaging biomarkers by image texture feature analysis and pattern recognition techniques; and (iii) develop a new technique to measure renal blood flow. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic's outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Mayo Clinic Translational PKD Center, which focuses on translating basic science research into improvements in the management and treatment of ADPKD patients. Dr. Kline's background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, Dr. Kline will: 1) develop a strong knowledge base in both nephrology and radiology by attending relevant rounds, seminars, and national conferences; 2) enhance his knowledge of medical imaging, biology, physiology, genetics, and programming through coursework and mentoring; 3) attend workshops focused on grant and publication writing; and 4) submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of new imaging biomarkers of ADPKD. Obtaining this K Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline's transition into a prosperous independent research career. Narrative Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders and is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Total kidney volume (TKV) has become the main image-based biomarker for following ADPKD progression. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming and costly. This project will develop automated tools to increase measurement throughput, and explore new image-based biomarkers that will significantly add to the assessment of patient prognosis, and will have the ability to more quickly judge the effectiveness of interventions.",Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD,9782929,K01DK110136,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood Vessels', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Consumption', 'Cyst', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'FarGo', 'Fibrosis', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hepatic Cyst', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Microscopic', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nephrology', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Renal Tissue', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Spin Labels', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Writing', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disease diagnosis', 'educational atmosphere', 'functional decline', 'human model', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'kidney vascular structure', 'knowledge base', 'novel imaging technology', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'prognostic value', 'radiological imaging', 'renal artery', 'research study', 'shear stress', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K01,2019,154915,276703803,0.01798212775064522
"Understanding Inflammatory Arthritis due to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors Project Summary/Abstract The major goals of this proposal are to attain skills required to be an independent clinical and translational researcher in rheumatology and to enhance understanding of a new rheumatic disease, inflammatory arthritis (IA) due to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). ICIs are revolutionizing cancer treatment but also cause immune related adverse events. ICI-induced IA is the immune related adverse event most likely to be encountered by rheumatologists. ICI-induced IA causes significant morbidity, is clinically heterogeneous, and can persist after ICI cessation. The proposed project will utilize a group of well characterized patients with ICI- induced IA and ICI-treated control patients who do not develop IA to address several important questions. First, the clinical heterogeneity within ICI-induced IA will be evaluated and factors that predict persistence of IA beyond cessation of ICI therapy will be established. Next, clinical and immunogenetic risk factors for developing ICI-induced IA will be determined. Finally, serum cytokine profiles and autoantibodies before and after ICI treatment will be compared in patients with ICI-induced IA and control patients who are treated with ICIs and do not develop IA. These experiments will address key knowledge gaps for this emerging clinical entity. Specifically, defining relevant clinical subgroups will allow for differential monitoring and treatment of patients. Understanding risk factors for development of IA will allow for risk stratification of patients prior to therapy. Cytokines that are elevated in ICI-induced IA patient sera could serve as future therapeutic targets. Finally, understanding presence of autoantibodies and when they develop in the course of ICI treatment will give insight into pathogenesis and identify potential biomarkers. Concurrently with conducting research during the proposal, the candidate will participate in a variety of career development activities taking advantage of the rich resources of Johns Hopkins in the Division of Rheumatology, the Bloomberg Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, and the Bloomberg School of Public Health. The candidate will participate in didactic coursework, conferences, and mentoring meetings with a diverse group of mentors from rheumatology, oncology, laboratory science, and data science. At the end of this award, the candidate will be an independent clinical investigator in the area of cancer immunotherapy and autoimmune disease and will establish a multi- center consortium with standardized data and biospecimen collection for rheumatic irAEs and for patients with preexisting autoimmune disease who are treated with ICIs. Project Narrative This project addresses an increasingly prevalent health condition, inflammatory arthritis due to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy for cancer. The proposal will allow for improved diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced inflammatory arthritis.

"Temporal Dietary and Physical Activity Patterns Related to Health Outcomes ABSTRACT Patterns (e.g. frequency, amount, etc.) of dietary intake and daily physical activity have each been independently linked with an increasing prevalence of obesity. Yet, connecting these patterns to obesity and chronic disease through the integration of time has not been previously considered. Given the strong evidence for independent linkages between each of these patterns and obesity, there is a critical need to determine the potential synergistic correlation of these patterns of behavior within the framework of a relationship with health. In the absence of such insights, opportunities for early detection of behavioral patterns that predispose obesity and chronic disease will be missed, and our long-term research goal to create these early detection strategies will not be met. The central hypothesis of this project is based on the analytical framework and methodology that was previously developed by the investigators: that daily patterns of energy intake, when integrated with physical activity, will be associated with health in a representative sample of U.S. adults 20 to 65 y (NHANES 2003-2006). The objectives in this R21 application include the development of data patterning methodology that can be used to create distinct dietary intake and physical activity patterns and then successfully integrate these patterns to identify population temporal pattern clusters. Next, the investigators will evaluate the cluster relationships with obesity and health outcomes and compare the integrated clusters to the un-integrated dietary and activity pattern clusters. The working hypotheses are firstly, that novel distance measures based on dynamic time warping for the dietary and physical activity data can be integrated to produce meaningful clustering related to health, and secondly, that a population cluster which exhibits a pattern of evenly spaced eating occasions, moderate energy consumption and moderate physical activity patterns in a 24 hour day will be associated with normal weight and without chronic disease, and that relationships with health outcomes will be stronger for the integrated temporal pattern clusters compared with un-integrated temporal dietary clusters and physical activity clusters. The rationale for this research is that its successful completion is expected to create data reduction methods that classify temporal lifestyle patterns linked to disease, further, the expectation is that these analytical techniques will integrate multidimensional temporal dietary and physical activity data. These outcomes are expected to have a significant positive impact, not only in developing/evaluating new analytic methods but in laying the groundwork for data based preventative interventions. This proposed research is potentially significant because results will provide a starting point for understanding the importance of the timing of dietary and physical activity patterns to the prevention of obesity and disease with potentially broad translational  RELEVANCE TO NIH The proposed research is relevant to public health because preventative time-based dietary and physical activity patterns will be identified among the US population, which are expected to open new research horizons for evidence-based recommendations for healthy lifestyles. The project is relevant to NIH's mission because individualized early detection of lifestyles supporting health or linked with disease may be attainable through the development of analytical techniques integrating multiple layers of data. Such strategies could be applied to utilize the increasing information from personal electronic monitoring devices and to detect patterns associated with positive and negative health outcomes.",Temporal Dietary and Physical Activity Patterns Related to Health Outcomes,9702773,R21CA224764,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Chronic Disease', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietary Factors', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eating', 'Energy Intake', 'Exhibits', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Moderate Exercise', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Sleep', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'circadian', 'data reduction', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'expectation', 'health data', 'healthy lifestyle', 'inferential statistics', 'innovation', 'insight', 'modifiable behavior', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity prevention', 'prevent', 'speech processing', 'unhealthy lifestyle', 'waist circumference']",NCI,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,156798,64946317,-0.009856185258894803
"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs. The proposed novel approaches are expected to advance precision medicine approaches to SUDs by enabling treatment matching and a more refined SUD classification to gene finding.",Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data,9625118,K02DA043063,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurobiology', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol use disorder', 'biomarker performance', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cocaine use', 'contingency management', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'genetic association', 'genomic data', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'opioid use disorder', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,K02,2019,162123,36067938,-0.035659782620202654
"Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning RESEARCH SUMMARY The goal of this award is to provide Andrew Beam, PhD with research support and comprehensive mentoring designed to transition him to an independent investigator in perinatal and neonatal informatics. Preterm labor (PTL) is labor which occurs before 37 weeks of gestation and carries with it enormous health and financial consequences. Preterm infants have some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity, yet machine-learning techniques for these important outcomes remains under developed. The research strategy is focused developing predictive models for two very important clinical scenarios using large sources of existing healthcare data. The focus of Specific Aim 1 develops a new form of machine learning known as deep learning for predicting PTL in pregnant women, while the focus of Specific Aim 2 investigates the use of deep learning for predicting clinical trajectories of preterm infants in the NICU. Currently, management and anticipation of both clinical scenarios is challenging and advancement in our predictive capacity could dramatically improve the quality and efficiency of the healthcare system. These models will be built using an existing database of 50 million patient-lives obtained through a partnership with a major US health insurer. Specific Aim 3 seeks to understand how the models constructed using this unique data resource translate and generalize to data from the electronic health records of Boston-area hospitals, which is a key concern for all healthcare data scientists. The education plan focuses on augmenting Dr. Beam’s graduate degrees in statistics and bioinformatics with additional training in clinical medicine and human pathology. This additional education will grant Dr. Beam a deeper understanding of the clinical problems faced by these populations and will allow for more fluid collaborations with clinicians in the future. The composition of Dr. Beam’s mentorship committee, which includes expertise in neonatology, biostatistics, and translational informatics, reflects his long-term desire to be quantitative scientist who works side-by-side practicing physicians so that quantitative research is translated into impactful clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infants born prematurely experience some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity and are among the most expensive patients in all of pediatrics. Now, with the availability of large sources of healthcare data from insurance claims databases and electronic health records, there is an opportunity to better understand prematurity and its predictors using computational techniques. We propose leveraging state of the art deep learning models built using data from hospitals and insurers to both predict which pregnancies will result in preterm birth and to predict which preterm infants will experience severe cardiac and pulmonary morbidity.",Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning,9928552,K01HL141771,"['37 weeks gestation', 'Accounting', 'Acute Disease', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Boston', 'Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia', 'Cardiac', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Technique', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Graduate Degree', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitals', 'Human Pathology', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Informatics', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neonatology', 'Outcome', 'Patent Ductus Arteriosus', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Perinatal', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Premature Labor', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Rest', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'education planning', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'improved', 'insurance claims', 'mortality', 'peer', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'respiratory distress syndrome', 'social', 'statistics']",NHLBI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K01,2019,166320,146629556,-0.0023368100035086933
"Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm PROJECT SUMMARY The development of large observational health databases (OHD) has expanded the data available for analysis by pharmacoepidemiology research. The efficiency of these studies may be improved by simultaneously studying the association of multiple medications with a disease of interest. Unfortunately, prior research has demonstrated that it is difficult to distinguish true-positive from false-positive results when studying multiple exposures simultaneously, thus limiting the conclusions drawn from these types of studies and representing a major gap in the field. The objective of this proposal, which is the first step in achieving the applicant's long- term goal of improving the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases using insights derived from OHD, is to evaluate and validate medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA), a novel set-based signal-to- noise enrichment algorithm developed by the applicant to analyze multiple exposures from OHD with high sensitivity and specificity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that MCEA has equal sensitivity and greater specificity compared to logistic regression, the most widely used analytic method for OHD, for identifying true associations between medications and clinical outcomes. The applicant will complete the following two interrelated specific aims to test the hypothesis: Aim 1 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA) and logistic regression (LR) for identifying medication associations with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and Aim 2 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of MCEA and LR for identifying medication associations with gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GIH). The rationale for these aims is that by reproducing known medication-disease associations without false positives, MCEA can be used to identify novel pharmacologic associations with gastrointestinal diseases in future studies. The expected outcome for the proposed research is that it will demonstrate MCEA as a valid method for pharmacoepidemiology research, opening new research opportunities for the study of multi-exposure OHD. These new research opportunities may lead to more rapid identification of potential pharmacologic causes of emerging diseases and discovery of unanticipated beneficial medication effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications. To attain the expected outcome, the applicant will complete additional coursework that builds on his Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology to learn computational biology, machine learning, and econometrics techniques. With the support of this grant and his institution, he will also directly apply these techniques to pharmacoepidemiology applications under the close mentorship of a carefully selected team of faculty with extensive experience in gastroenterology, pharmacoepidemiology, medical informatics, and mentoring prior K-award grant recipients. Through these activities, the applicant will develop the skills necessary to obtain NIH R01-level funding and become a leader in developing novel techniques for application to the epidemiologic study of gastrointestinal diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traditionally, research studying medications associated with diseases are limited to analyzing one medication at a time. This novel proposal will validate medication class enrichment analysis, a recently developed algorithm to study multiple medications simultaneously for association with a disease of interest. Validation of this method will allow researchers to use existing medical databases to more rapidly identify potential medication causes of emerging diseases and identify medications with unanticipated beneficial effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications.",Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm,9645854,K08DK119475,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Aminoglycosides', 'Antibiotics', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Carbapenems', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cephalosporins', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Outcome', 'Penicillins', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'analytical method', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'career development', 'clinical epidemiology', 'econometrics', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'research study', 'simulation', 'skills', 'usability']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2019,169440,593605914,-0.0072310404921737395
"Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Michael Mathis is a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist with board certification in anesthesiology and advanced perioperative echocardiography at the University of Michigan. Through completion of a T32 Research Training Grant, Dr. Mathis has developed expertise in perioperative outcomes research for patients with advanced cardiovascular disease. His long-term career goal is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF) through harnessing perioperative electronic healthcare record (EHR) data for early diagnosis and management. This proposal builds on Dr. Mathis's expertise, providing protected time for training in data science methods necessary to drive forward the analytic techniques proposed for improving HF diagnosis. Environment: The University of Michigan is the coordinating center for the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG), an international consortium of over 50 anesthesiology and surgical departments with perioperative information systems. Dr. Sachin Kheterpal, MD, MBA is the primary mentor for Dr. Mathis, and is the Director for MPOG and member of the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative Advisory Panel. The proposed research will be completed under the guidance of Dr. Kheterpal, as well as co-mentors Milo Engoren, MD, Daniel Clauw, MD, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD. An advisory panel of experts in HF diagnosis and data science methodologies will provide Dr. Mathis with additional guidance. Background: HF is among the most common chronic conditions requiring hospitalization and carries high rates of mortality. In the perioperative period, HF is a risk factor for major cardiac complications. Despite advances in care, little progress has been made to reduce HF healthcare burden, with difficulties attributable to a lack of inexpensive, reliable diagnostic measures. Consequently, patients with HF can go unrecognized in early stages and do not receive treatments to reduce mortality. The perioperative period is an underutilized opportunity to improve HF diagnosis. Beyond the wealth of preoperative data available, the intraoperative period serves as a cardiac stress test through which hemodynamic responses to surgical and anesthetic stimuli are recorded with high resolution. Yet, this data remains an untapped resource for HF evaluation. Research: The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate the perioperative period as an opportunity for early diagnosis of HF. The two specific Aims are to develop a data-driven diagnostic algorithm for HF using preoperative EHR data (Aim 1) as well as intraoperative EHR data (Aim 2). Both aims will use automated techniques to extract features of HF from the perioperative EHR, developed at UM and scalable to multiple centers via the MPOG infrastructure. This work represents a paradigm shift in perioperative evaluation, using perioperative data as a diagnostic tool rather than a risk-assessment tool. The proposed research and training will provide Dr. Mathis with necessary data science computational experience to become an independent physician-investigator focused on improving perioperative management strategies for patients with HF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Public Health Relevance Statement: Heart failure is a common chronic condition affecting over 550,000 patients each year, with a 45–60% mortality rate at 5 years. Despite advances in treatment, little progress has been made to improve heart failure diagnosis, and thus patients in early heart failure stages do not receive appropriate life-extending therapies.

Dr. Dickson is a Pulmonary and Critical Care physician and scientist at the University of Michigan with established success in the burgeoning field of lung microbiome studies. This proposal builds on Dr. Dickson's previously acquired expertise in pulmonary pathophysiology and microbial ecology with new training in clinical research methods and computational biology. These established and newly-acquired skills will be integrated to improve our understanding of the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). This research will be conducted under the guidance of primary mentor Gary B. Huffnagle PhD, co- mentor Theodore J. Standiford MD and an advisory board of accomplished investigators with expertise in clinical research methods, computational biology and lung immunology as well as extensive mentoring success. This 5-year plan includes formal coursework, professional development, and progressively independent research, with defined milestones to ensure productivity and a successful transition to independence. The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expense, responsible for an estimated 74,500 U.S. deaths per year. Numerous studies have identified indirect evidence of translocation of bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the lung in patients at risk for ARDS, but to date no study has evaluated the role of microbiome in the pathogenesis of ARDS. This proposal will test the hypothesis that translocation of gut bacteria to the lung provokes the inflammation and injury of ARDS via two specific Scientific Aims. Aim 1 will determine if translocation of enteric bacteria to the lung microbiome precedes the clinical development of ARDS, and Aim 2 will determine the temporal relationship between respiratory dysbiosis, host inflammation and the clinical onset of ARDS. Inherent to completing these high-level aims, Dr. Dickson will execute a prospective cohort study of patients at high risk for ARDS, utilize modern culture-independent techniques of bacterial identification to describe the bacterial communities in the lungs and gastrointestinal tracts of high-risk patients, and apply novel techniques of advanced computational modeling to the complex nonlinear system of ARDS pathogenesis. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: 1) to determine if the lung microbiome contributes to disease progression among patients with established ARDS and 2) to determine if the lung microbiome can be therapeutically manipulated in critically ill patients to prevent or modulate respiratory disease. n addition to building a foundation for a programmatic line of research to understand the role of the microbiome in lung disease, this proposal will provide Dr. Dickson with research skills applicable to additional domains of human microbiome and ARDS research. This K23 award will equip Dr. Dickson to establish himself as an independent investigator and international leader in this promising field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expense, responsible for an estimated 74,500 U.S. deaths per year; the National Institutes of Health have identified the prevention and early treatment of ARDS as a research priority. We lack an understanding of the pathogenesis of ARDS, impeding our ability to predict and prevent its onset. Determination of the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of ARDS would both 1) improve our ability to predict the onset of ARDS, enabling targeted preventive interventions and 2) identify novel therapeutic targets at the microbiome/host interface in patients at risk for ARDS.",The Role of the Microbiome in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,9619605,K23HL130641,"['Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Alveolar', 'Bacteria', 'Catecholamines', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Culture-independent methods', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early treatment', 'Ecology', 'Ensure', 'Enterobacter', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Epinephrine', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gammaproteobacteria', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immigration', 'Immunology', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Non-linear Models', 'Norepinephrine', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Pseudomonas', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'bacterial community', 'bacteriome', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical development', 'clinical risk', 'cytokine', 'dysbiosis', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal bacteria', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'host microbiome', 'improved', 'indexing', 'lung microbiome', 'lung microbiota', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'mortality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'respiratory microbiome', 'skills', 'spatiotemporal', 'success']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2019,172256,641965656,0.006429732484210478
"SURPASS: (Statin Use and Risk Prediction of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in minority Subgroups) PROJECT SUMMARY Despite advances in technology, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death, disability, and healthcare costs in the U.S. Yet, there is a tremendous gap in accurate cardiovascular risk prediction and prevention, particularly in racial/ethnic minorities. Furthermore, there is significant heterogeneity in CVD risks and outcomes for disaggregated Hispanic and Asian subgroups. The current cardiovascular risk assessment tools have not been well-validated in these diverse populations, and it remains largely unknown why minority patients are less likely to start and more likely to stop life-saving therapies. The overall goal of Dr. Rodriguez’s K01 application is to address gaps in knowledge about CVD prediction and treatment in understudied racial/ethnic minority populations. The proposed study will utilize the electronic health record (EHR) data from an established NHLBI-funded cohort enriched with disaggregated Hispanic and Asian patients. Using this cohort, Dr. Rodriguez will first test the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations in disaggregated Asian and Hispanic subgroups using a large diverse mixed-payer cohort of 1,234,751 patients from two large healthcare systems in Northern California and Hawaii. Secondly, she will build new CVD risk prediction models for diverse patient subgroups using machine learning techniques. Finally, she will identify reasons for statin underuse and discontinuation using natural language processing in the EHR. This study, which will evaluate existing data from real-world clinical practice in a stable population, will inform future risk prediction models and cholesterol treatment guidelines for diverse racial/ethnic groups. The proposal is aligned with the NHBLI’s strategic goals to eliminate health disparities and inequities by leveraging epidemiology and data science to understand and solve complex health problems. This proposal will also prepare Dr. Rodriguez to meet her long-term goal of becoming a national leader and independent investigator in CVD prevention and minority health. The proposed didactic and applied data science experiences, including training in advanced epidemiological methods and machine learning, will prepare Dr. Rodriguez to apply her research to other areas of CVD prevention and populations. This training program builds on the strengths of Stanford University in health services research, epidemiology, and biomedical informatics. Her mentorship team, led by Dr. Latha Palaniappan, includes experts in cardiovascular prevention and health services research (Dr. Heidenreich, co-mentor), applied statistical analyses (Dr. Robert Tibshirani, advisor), machine learning in the EHR (Dr. Nigam Shah, advisor), and chronic disease prediction and medical decision making (Dr. Michael Pignone, advisor). Dr. Rodriguez’s team is committed to ensuring the success of the proposal as well as overseeing her advanced training in their respective areas of expertise. The research and training plan proposed in this K01 application will develop Dr. Rodriguez into a unique and highly-skilled clinician researcher ready to compete for R-level funding and launch her independent research career. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for racial/ethnic minority groups in the U.S., yet current CVD risk prediction algorithms fail to adequately assess risk in these populations. The proposal will address this substantial knowledge gap by validating current risk prediction models in racial/ethnic minority subgroups, improving risk prediction using modern machine learning techniques, and identifying reasons for statin discontinuation. Findings from this study will provide the foundation for clinical guidelines, research agendas, and public health interventions to improve CVD prevention strategies in diverse populations. !",SURPASS: (Statin Use and Risk Prediction of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in minority Subgroups),9645316,K01HL144607,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Area', 'Asians', 'Assessment tool', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biometry', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Outcome', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Mexican Americans', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Puerto Rican', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'South Asian', 'Stable Populations', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Woman', 'Work', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'college', 'disability', 'disparity reduction', 'epidemiologic data', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health difference', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'i(19)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'minority health', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'patient subsets', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevention service', 'public health intervention', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'random forest', 'risk prediction model', 'side effect', 'skills', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'treatment guidelines']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,172692,560644462,-0.01731884597476482
"Improving cancer family history collection through social networking and artificial intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY  The  activities  proposed  in  this  NCI  K07  application  are  designed  to  advance  the  career  development  and  research  independence  of  Dr.  Brandon  M.  Welch.  Family  health  history  (FHx)  is  one  of  the most important  resources available to help clinicians identify disease risks. By knowing a patient's FHx, clinicians can quickly  identify  disease risks and initiate risk-reducing strategies such as increased screening, prophylactic surgery,  risk-reducing  therapeutics,  and  lifestyle  changes.  FHx  is  also  the  foundation  of  genomic  medicine.  Unfortunately,  the  collection  and  use  of  FHx  by  patients  and  clinicians  is  suboptimal.  To  improve  the  collection and use of FHx among the general population, a better FHx tool that is easier and more convenient  to  use  than  current  FHx  tools  is  needed.  A  new  FHx  web  tool,  called  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com,​  incorporates  artificial intelligence and social networking to improve user engagement with FHx collection.Utilizing artificial  intelligence  based  chat  entity  can  improve  the  collection  of  FHx  information  by  making  it  easier  and  more  engaging to record FHx information, likewise social networking allows users to tap into the collective wisdom  and  knowledge  of  the  family  to  correct  inaccuracies  and  overcome  gaps  in  FHx  knowledge.  This research  study  will  first  identify  enhancements  to  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com  ​that  will  further  promote  user  engagement,  with  particular  focus  on  rural and underserved patients (Aim 1). We will then evaluate whether this new FHx  tool can improve collection of cancer FHx in comparison with current FHx tools (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess  the impact of ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com ​on the clinical settings (Aim 3). To implement the research plan, it will be  critical  to  apply,  skills  obtained  through  K  award  learning  objectives,  namely  clinical  oncology  (learning  objective  1),  iterative  patient-centered  design  (learning  objective  2),  and  health  technology  assessment  (learning  objective  3).  To  fulfill  these  learning  objectives,  an  interdisciplinary  group  of  mentors  will  direct  a  comprehensive training plan. The training plan includes coursework, seminars, workshops, journal clubs, and  conferences,  covering clinical oncology, patient engagement, health disparities, user-centered development,  human-computer  interaction,  clinical  research  methodologies,  health  technology  assessment,  and  ethical  conduct  of  research.  The  strong  support  of  an  excellent  team  of  mentors,  and  the  vast  resources  of  the  Medical  University  of  South  Carolina,  create  an  optimal  training  environment.  Collectively,  the  integrated  learning  objectives  and  research  plan  are  critical  to  establishing  a  successful,  innovative,  and  meaningful  academic career focused on developing patient-centric informatics tools for oncology.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Family health history (FHx) is one of the most important risk factors for cancer and the foundation of genomic medicine, but is under-utilized by patients and clinicians.

"Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches Candidate: Dr. Tedeschi is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Associate Physician in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy’s Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). She received an MPH from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her 10 first-author manuscripts, two BWH grants, and foundation award exemplify her productivity and commitment to research. She has assembled an experienced team of mentors and collaborators, led by Dr. Daniel Solomon (primary mentor) and Drs. Katherine Liao and Karen Costenbader (co-mentors), to guide her training in natural language processing and machine learning approaches for clinical research, analysis of linked electronic medical record (EMR) and Medicare claims data, and interpretation of advanced imaging modalities. Focused coursework at HSPH and HMS will complement the experience she gains through her proposed studies of pseudogout risk factors and long-term outcomes. Training in dual- energy CT and ultrasound interpretation for crystalline arthritis will be obtained via one-on-one sessions. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator focused on pseudogout. Environment: Dr. Tedeschi has a commitment from her Division for >75% protected time for research and career development activities during the K23 award period. Support from the Division and her primary mentor’s research funds will supplement her salary and project-related expenses. The SCS, a collaborative clinical research group in the Division of Rheumatology, has extensive infrastructure including the VERITY Bioinformatics Core (NIH-P30-AR072577, PI: Solomon) that will provide resources and expertise for the proposed studies. In addition, the BWH Arthritis Center is one of the largest nationally, facilitating subject recruitment, and the BWH Division of Musculoskeletal Imaging has state-of-the-art equipment and expertise applying dual-energy CT in crystalline arthritis. Coursework at HSPH and HMS, adjacent to BWH, will provide training necessary for Dr. Tedeschi’s development into an independent investigator. Research: Dr. Tedeschi’s long-term objective is to prevent and reduce morbidity from pseudogout, an understudied, painful crystalline arthritis that affects 8-10 million Americans. She will use natural language processing and machine learning approaches to enhance an algorithm for identifying pseudogout in EMR data. She will study risk factors for and long-term outcomes in pseudogout, harnessing vast amounts of information contained in Partners HealthCare EMR data and Medicare claims data, and will gain experience working with linked datasets. Dr. Tedeschi will recruit subjects with pseudogout and other types of mono- and oligoarthritis to test and compare the performance of dual-energy CT scanning, musculoskeletal ultrasound, and x-ray for identifying pseudogout. Her proposed K23 projects will lead to manuscripts and data to be leveraged in an R01 application focused on pseudogout during the award period, leading to independence as a patient-oriented investigator. Project Narrative The proposed studies will contribute fundamental knowledge about pseudogout, a common, painful crystalline arthritis for which we have little prognostic information and no targeted treatments. Results from the proposed projects could lead to methods for non-invasive, accurate pseudogout diagnosis, development of preventive strategies for pseudogout, and interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Future work stemming from the proposed projects may include predictive models of pseudogout flares, identification of serum biomarkers for pseudogout, and development of outcomes measures to be used in prospectively recruited pseudogout cohort studies.",Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches,9717330,K23AR075070,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arthritis', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Calcium Pyrophosphate', 'Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diuretics', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Female', 'Flare', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Gout', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Productivity', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors', 'Pseudogout', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Structure', 'Synovial Fluid', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vascular calcification', 'Vascularization', 'Visit', 'Wages', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bisphosphonate', 'calcium indicator', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'crystallinity', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'imaging modality', 'instructor', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'musculoskeletal ultrasound', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ranpirnase', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'sex', 'side effect', 'stem', 'targeted treatment', 'unnecessary treatment']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2019,176541,327644200,0.005136093743529063
"Leveraging modern analytic approaches to improve diabetes outcomes ABSTRACT Diabetic patients are at risk of developing diabetic heart disease, which may lead to complications in care. Diabetic heart disease patients not only have exceptionally high healthcare expenditures and resource utilization but also are likely to have poor patient outcomes. Studies have shown that early intervention of patients likely to develop diabetic heart disease is cost-effective and yields favorable health outcomes. Therefore, early identiﬁcation of diabetic patients at high-risk of developing diabetic heart disease is crucial to provide effective interventions. The commonly accepted methodology for diabetic heart disease risk prediction is the use of one or more risk scoring systems. However, these risk functions may not generalize well for the diabetes patient and may suffer from poor calibration when used on different cohorts. Moreover, the scoring systems have only been studied on coronary heart disease, one variant of diabetic heart disease while heart failure and diabetic cardiomyopathy remain important, yet insufﬁciently studied problems. Machine learning offers the ability to perform accurate predictive analytics and has been proposed as a way to identify and manage high-risk patients. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a high-impact and practical risk prediction model that can be used to per- form early identiﬁcation of high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. Given the heterogeneity and complexity of patient information in electronic health records, the model needs to capitalize on the multi-dimensional temporal nature of pa- tient records to extract identifying characteristics of patients that will develop diabetic heart disease. To accomplish this, we will leverage modern machine learning approaches such as tensor factorization and natural language processing to model complex patient characteristics, provide a more complete representation of the patient, and uncover excellent predictors of diabetic heart disease risk. An existing dataset that contains the de-identiﬁed electronic health records of approximately 4,100 diabetic patients from the Emory Healthcare System to compare the predictive power of machine learning-based algorithms with the standard risk scoring systems. These algorithms will be evaluated on calibration, discrimination, and ease of interpretability. The results of this work will provide insight as to how to develop a machine learning–based prediction system that can identify high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. The study may also shed light on the best approaches for fusing data from multiple heterogeneous sources to build a better predictive model and potentially identify novel indicators of high- risk diabetic heart disease factors. Moreover, the work will help inform a larger multi-site study of diabetic heart disease risk prediction and develop methods to generalize the results to a broader spectrum of comorbidities. This project is consistent with the National Library of Medicine's mission to translate biomedical research into practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetic patients are risk of developing diabetic heart disease which can lead to high healthcare expenditure, high resource utilization, and poor patient outcomes. Existing diabetic risk prediction models can suffer from poor calibration and predictive accuracy.

"Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis Abstract This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Danhong Wang, a physician-scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Wang is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient- oriented neuroimaging research on psychiatric disorders. This K01 award will provide Dr. Wang with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in patient-oriented research in psychiatric neuroimaging; (2) to conduct experimental investigations of neurobiological correlates in patients with psychosis; (3) to implement revolutionary individual-level functional mapping techniques in clinical studies; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wang has assembled a mentoring team comprised of three mentors: Dr. Dost Öngür, Chief of the McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division, who leads a neuroimaging laboratory studying the biology of psychotic illness; Dr. Randy Buckner, Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Harvard University and Director of Psychiatric Neuroimaging at Massachusetts General Hospital, one of the pioneers in functional MRI research; and Dr. Suzanne Haber, Professor of Pharmacology and Physiology at the University of Rochester, a leading scientist in the field of neuroanatomy. In addition, Dr. Hesheng Liu, Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and a computational neuroscientist with expertise in functional imaging, will collaborate on this project. Dr. Wang will engage in multiple career development activities to expand her ability to develop mechanistic insights about psychiatric disorders. These include new training in patient-oriented experimental research, a better understanding of the psychopathology of psychosis, and a stronger grasp of neuroanatomy. She will also receive advanced training in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Determining the disconnected neural circuits underlying psychosis has proved elusive. Dr. Wang's research project aims to reveal circuitry abnormalities in psychotic patients using a subject-specific, cross-diagnostic approach. In Aim 1, Dr. Wang will establish methods for accurately characterizing the cortical and subcortical functional connectivity networks in individual patients. In Aim 2, leveraging a cross-diagnostic cohort of psychotic patients that will be scanned using the protocol optimized for individual-level functional analyses, as well as an existing patient data set, Dr. Wang will identify and validate cortical and subcortical functional connectivity abnormalities related to the severity of psychotic symptoms. In Aim 3, Dr. Wang will investigate the temporal variations of connectivity in individual patients and reveal abnormalities in dynamic functional connectivity related to symptoms.

"Machine learning-based segmentation and risk modeling for real-time prediction of major arterial bleeding after pelvic fractures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Arterial hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is a leading reversible cause of death after blunt trauma. Prediction of arterial bleeding risk is difficult, and currently determined using subjective criteria, often based on qualitative results of admission computed tomography (CT). Segmented hematoma and contrast extravasation (CE) volumes predict need for angioembolization, major transfusion, and mortality but cannot be applied in real-time. The ill-defined multi-focal nature of pelvic hematomas and CE prevents reliable estimation using diameter-based measurements. Dr. Dreizin is a trauma radiologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. His early work has focused on improving the speed and reliability of volumetric analysis of pelvic hematomas using semi-automated techniques, and derivation of a logistic regression-based prediction tool for major arterial injury after pelvic fractures. Dr. Dreizin’s goal for this four- year K08 mentored career development award proposal is to gain the skills needed to 1) implement deep learning architectures for automated hematoma volume segmentation and 2) develop computational models for outcome prediction after pelvic trauma. These tools could greatly improve the speed and accuracy of clinical decision making in the setting of life-threatening traumatic pelvic bleeding. Fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) have emerged as the most robust and scalable method for automated medical image segmentation. Intuitive software platforms for training FCN implementations and generating multivariable machine learning models have been developed in the Python programming environment. The training objectives and research activities of this proposal are necessary to provide Dr. Dreizin with new skills and practical experience in Python programming, deep learning software, and computational modeling software. By understanding the principles and computational infrastructure behind modern machine learning, Dr. Dreizin will be able to train and validate state-of-the-art algorithms independently and effectively lead a team of researchers in this area. To achieve his goals, Dr. Dreizin has assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentors, advisors, and collaborators with world-leading expertise in computer vision in medical imaging, probability theory, data science, and comparative effectiveness research. Dr. Dreizin will focus on two specific aims. In Aim 1, he will train and validate deep learning architectures for segmentation of traumatic pelvic hematomas and CE by computing the Dice metric, time effort, and correlation with clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, he will generate and test quantitative models for predicting major arterial bleeding after pelvic trauma based on a rich multi-label dataset of segmented features. The training and pilot data will be necessary for Dr. Dreizin’s long- term goal of research independence and R01 support to develop automated segmentation algorithms for the spectrum of clinically important imaging features after pelvic trauma, as well as fully automated multivariable clinical prediction tools with potential for translation to industry and as an FDA-cleared product. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is common after motor vehicle collisions, falls, and crush injuries, with mortality rates that range from 5-54%. The volume of hemorrhage, as measured on computed tomography (CT) scans, predicts the need for rapid intervention or transfusion, and is a strong predictor of mortality, but no automated image-processing methods exist for real-time hemorrhage volume measurement. We propose to develop automated software for hemorrhage-detection, and real-time risk prediction software for major arterial hemorrhage after pelvic fractures.",Machine learning-based segmentation and risk modeling for real-time prediction of major arterial bleeding after pelvic fractures,9819865,K08EB027141,"['Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arterial Injury', 'Award', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Caliber', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Crush Injury', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Extravasation', 'Fall injury', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hematoma', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maryland', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Predictive Value', 'Probability Theory', 'Process', 'Programming Languages', 'Pythons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shorthand', 'Speed', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transfusion', 'Translations', 'Trauma', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Vehicle crash', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adverse outcome', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'comparative effectiveness', 'computer infrastructure', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'effectiveness research', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'heuristics', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'muscle form', 'neural network architecture', 'outcome prediction', 'pelvis fracture', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'radiologist', 'random forest', 'real time model', 'secondary outcome', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,K08,2019,186183,230060143,0.012879706042043772
"Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD Project Summary Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. To date, researchers have attempted to use standard machine learning methodology to identify more meaningful subtypes of COPD, but these methods often make general assumptions about the data, limiting their ability to penetrate more complex patterns in some data sets. Thus, a meaningful reclassification of COPD subtypes that could lead to more targeted therapies and interventions has been elusive. The applicant introduces a new way of looking at the COPD subtyping problem by recasting it in terms of discovering associations of individuals to disease trajectories – i.e., grouping individuals based on their similarity in response to environmental and/or disease causing variables. The machine learning methods proposed build on the most recent advances in Bayesian nonparametrics, a collection of theoretical ideas and techniques that permit very flexible data representations. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that these machine learning methods and extensions thereof – together with data sources not previously leveraged for COPD subtyping – will produce more biologically meaningful sub-groupings of patients, leading to a better understanding of the genetic and biological underpinnings of the disease and ultimately improved patient management. Aim 1 of this application involves evaluating the utility of CT-assessed lung mass – a potentially more discriminative measure of emphysema than conventionally used measures – for defining COPD subtypes using both K-means clustering and our disease trajectory algorithm. The goal of Aim 2 is to evaluate the utility of comorbidity data for defining COPD subtypes using our trajectory clustering algorithm. Novel computed tomography based measures of muscle wasting (cachexia) and pulmonary vascular pruning will be explored to determine their efficacy in subtype determination. Additionally, we will extend and test the trajectory algorithm in order to model discrete outputs (such as physician-diagnosed comorbidities), count data (e.g. exacerbations), and time-to-event data (death). In Aim 3, the applicant will extend our trajectory clustering algorithms to directly incorporate genetic and omics data for subtype discovery. Together, the research proposed in the aims of this award will take full advantage of the comprehensive data set available through the COPDGene study. Execution of the aims in this proposal will be possible through active collaboration with Dr. Ron Kikinis, M.D., a renowned leader in the field of medical image analysis, and Dr. Ed Silverman, an internationally recognized expert in the genetic epidemiology of COPD. Project Narrative Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. In carrying out the research outlined in the following proposal, we plan to develop and apply machine learning methods to better identify subpopulations of individuals who have similar forms of COPD, potentially enabling better, targeted therapies.",Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD,9704042,K25HL130637,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cachexia', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Functional Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Mass', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Scheme', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career development', 'cigarette smoke', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'flexibility', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'particle', 'peripheral blood', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K25,2019,189000,327644200,7.549983806625672e-05
"MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy parkinsonian type (MSA-P), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are costly and devastating neurodegenerative diseases. They have overlapping clinical manifestations and diagnosis remains challenging in many cases. Thus far no effective treatments have been developed to meaningfully slow or stop their progression. This is due in part to a lack of tools to objectively measure degeneration in the neural systems affected by each of these diseases. Availability of such tools would assist clinical diagnosis, facilitate selection of appropriate patient groups for trial recruitment, and enable objective measurement of treatment outcomes. Recent MRI studies suggest that disease-specific brain changes can, indeed, be identified in these parkinsonian diseases. The objective of this research is to identify univariable markers and multivariable MRI signatures that capture distinct patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to accurately distinguish these diseases.  To accomplish this the investigators use 3 Tesla MRI contrasts sensitive to key features of neurodegeneration to 1) identify structures damaged by PD, MSA-P and PSP and 2) to quantify the extent of damage in each neural system in parkinsonian diseases. Specifically, the investigators use neuromelanin- sensitive MRI to measure neuromelanin loss and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and R2* imaging to measure iron accumulation in patients with PD, MSA-P, and PSP. Using these contrasts and an innovative region of interest (ROI) selection approach, they reproducibly measure patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems. In Aim 1 the investigators use neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to study neuromelanin loss in PD, MSA-P and PSP in to identify univariable disease features that are differentially affected by parkinsonian diseases and may assist distinguishing these conditions. In Aim 2 they use QSM and R2* MRI to study ROIs differentially impacted by PD, MSA-P and PSP to identify iron accumulation biomarkers to help distinguish these diseases. In Aim 3 the investigators apply machine learning classification algorithms to identify multivariable MRI signatures of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to differentiate PD, MSA-P and PSP. Study outputs will be candidate MRI biomarkers and disease signatures. The long term goal of this research is to further develop these outputs for use as clinical diagnostic tools and as biomarkers for subject selection and outcome measurement in clinical trials.  Through this career award Dr. Huddleston will gain new skills in MRI methods, data science, and neural systems imaging in parkinsonian diseases. These new skills will enable Dr. Huddleston to design and lead interdisciplinary neuroimaging biomarker studies for Parkinson’s disease and related disorders. His mentor team is comprised of leaders in their fields. This team and the dynamic research environment at Emory University provide the necessary support for Dr. Huddleston to successfully transition to scientific independence. There is an urgent public health need for new treatments to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy, and objective tools to distinguish these diseases for clinical and research purposes are lacking. The outputs of the proposed research will be candidate MRI biomarkers and multivariable MRI signatures to differentiate these conditions. These candidate biomarkers may be developed for use in clinical trial designs to increase their odds of success, and they may also assist clinical diagnosis.",MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism,9786824,K23NS105944,"['Affect', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical assessments', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Iron', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple System Atrophy', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Progressive Supranuclear Palsy', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Red nucleus structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Subjects Selections', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromelanin', 'neuron loss', 'nigrostriatal system', 'novel', 'pars compacta', 'patient screening', 'putamen', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2019,192564,507546965,-0.0161939947962377
"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at a younger age have higher rates of complications than those diagnosed later in life. Given the lasting benefit conferred by early disease control, the initial care provided to this growing, high-risk population is particularly crucial. With this proposed career development award, Dr. Gopalan will acquire the research skills necessary to identify patients at highest risk for inadequate early disease control, define barriers to initial disease management, and develop an intervention designed to improve the care of adults (ages 21-44) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,9785527,K23DK116968,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United Kingdom', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diabetes education', 'diabetes management', 'disorder control', 'eHealth', 'early onset', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'literacy', 'macrovascular disease', 'member', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'racial and ethnic', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'young adult']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K23,2019,192917,111231681,-0.014058873536387205
"Computational Characterization of Environmental Enteropathy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Undernutrition afflicts 20% of children < 5 years of age in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and is a major risk factor for mortality. Linear growth failure (or stunting) in children is tightly linked to irreversible physical and cognitive deficits, with profound implications for development. A common cause of stunting in LMICs is Environmental Enteropathy (EE) which has also been linked to decreased oral vaccine immunogenicity. To date, there are no universally accepted, clear diagnostic algorithms or non-invasive biomarkers for EE making this a critical priority. In this K23 Mentored Career Development Award application, Dr. Sana Syed, a Pediatric Gastroenterologist with advanced training in Nutrition at the University of Virginia, proposes to 1) Develop and validate a Deep Learning Net to identify morphological features of EE versus celiac and healthy small intestinal tissue, 2) correlate the Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing EE intestinal tissue findings with clinical phenotype, measures of gut barrier and absorption, and bile acid deconjugation, and 3) Use a Deep Learning Net computational approach to identify distinguishing multiomic patterns of EE versus celiac disease. This work will be carried out in the context of an ongoing birth cohort study of environmental enteropathy in Pakistan (SEEM). Dr. Syed proposes a career development plan which includes mentorship, fieldwork, coursework, publications, and clinical time that will situate her as an independent physician-scientist with expertise in translational research employing computational `omics and image approaches to elucidate biologic mechanisms of stunting pathways and in identification of novel and effective therapies for EE. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development award will: a) Lead to the development and validation of a pediatric-specific Environmental Enteropathy (EE) Deep Learning Net for small intestinal structure which is urgently needed to standardize the diagnosis, care, and research of EE worldwide; b) Employ computational methods to correlate Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing morphological EE features with multiomic data to provide comprehensive diagnostic and predictive criteria for EE, and c) Validation of promising circulating biomarkers against intestinal biopsies, the diagnostic gold standard for enteropathies.

"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015). He has published in several gastroenterology journals, presented research internationally, and has built the independent collaborations featured in this proposal. Central to this career development award, the candidate will leverage the expertise of several mentors and collaborators to develop deep foundational skillsets in analytic imaging, translational proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods. The University of Michigan houses a nationally recognized Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, internationally recognized proteomics expertise, and a dedicated Analytic Morphomics Group focused on computational image analysis of organs. The mentored research training will be supplemented with focused graduate-level coursework in bioinformatics, medical image analysis, machine learning methodologies, and decision support systems provided through the University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the School of Public Health. The Division of Gastroenterology and Department of Medicine have a history of strong support for Dr. Stidham and will provide the time, resources, and mentorship necessary to achieve his professional and research goals. The training provided through this career development award will be pivotal for the candidate's development as an independent translational investigator focused on individualizing therapeutic management. This research will provide the foundation for future collaborative studies to further develop these and other prognostic tools for the inflammatory bowel diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work evaluates the capabilities of quantitative image analysis and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict the probability of medical response in Crohn's disease. Improved prediction of therapeutic response would tailor Crohn's disease management such that patients unlikely to benefit from medical therapy can proceed to timely surgical management and be spared the risks and costs of modern immunosuppressive treatments.",Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease,9733206,K23DK101687,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Colonoscopy', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Fibrosis', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intestinal Fibrosis', 'Intestines', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Serum', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Steroids', 'Surgical Management', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'blood-based biomarker', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital imaging', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'glycoproteomics', 'improved', 'large bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'learning strategy', 'lecturer', 'matriculation', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'research and development', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool development', 'translational impact', 'translational scientist', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2019,194368,641965656,0.020297226064954644
"A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney Project Summary  Despite the widespread prevalence of ultrasound imaging in hospitals today, the clinical utility of ultrasound guidance is severely hampered by clutter and reverberation artifacts that obscure structures of interest and com- plicate anatomical measurements. Clutter is particularly problematic in overweight and obese individuals, who account for 78.6 million adults and 12.8 million children in North America. Similarly, interventional procedures of- ten require insertion of one or more metal tools, which generate reverberation artifacts that obfuscate instrument location, orientation, and geometry, while obscuring nearby tissues, thus additionally hampering ultrasound im- age quality. Although artifacts are problematic, ultrasound continues to persist primarily because of its greatest strengths (i.e., mobility, cost, non-ionizing radiation, real-time visualization, and multiplanar views) in comparison to existing image-guidance options, but it would be signiﬁcantly more useful without problematic artifacts.  Our long-term project goal is to use state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to provide interventional radiologists with artifact-free ultrasound-based images. We will initially develop a new framework alternative to the ultrasound beamforming process that removes needle tip reverberations and acoustic clutter caused by multipath scattering in near-ﬁeld tissues when guiding needles to the kidney to enable removal of painful kidney stones. Our ﬁrst aim will test convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that input raw channel data and output human readable images with no artifacts caused by multipath scattering and reverberations. A secondary goal of the CNNs is to learn the minimum number of parameters required to create these new CNN-based images. Our second aim will validate the trained algorithms with ultrasound data from experimental phantom and ex vivo tissue. Our third aim will extend our evaluation to ultrasound images of in vivo porcine kidneys. This work is the ﬁrst to propose bypassing the entire beamforming process and replacing it with machine learning and computer vision techniques to remove traditionally problematic noise artifacts and create a fundamentally new type of artifact-free, high-contrast, high-resolution, ultrasound-based image for guiding interventional procedures.  This work combines the expertise of an imaging scientist, a computer scientist, and an interventional ra- diologist to explore an untapped, understudied area that is only recently made feasible through improvements in computing power, advances in computer vision capabilities, and new knowledge about dominant sources of image degradation. Translation to in vivo cases is enabled by our clinical collaboration with the Department of Radiology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. With support from the NIH Trailblazer Award, our team will be the ﬁrst to develop these tools and capabilities to eliminate noise artifacts in interventional ultrasound, opening the door to a new paradigm in ultrasound image formation, which will directly beneﬁt millions of patients with clearer, easier-to-interpret ultrasound images. Subsequent R01 funding will customize our innovation to addi- tional application-speciﬁc ultrasound procedures (e.g., breast biopsies, cancer detection, autonomous surgery). Project Narrative Artifacts in ultrasound images, speciﬁcally artifacts caused by multipath scattering and acoustic reverberations (which occur when imaging through the abdominal tissue of overweight and obese patients or visualizing metallic surgical tools), remain as a major clinical challenge. There are no existing solutions to eliminate these artifacts based on today's signal processing techniques. The goal of this project is to step away from conventional signal processing models and instead learn from raw data examples with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques that differentiate artifacts from true signals, and thereby deliver clearer, easier-to-interpret images.",A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney,9748523,R21EB025621,"['Abdomen', 'Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Biopsy', 'Breast biopsy', 'Bypass', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cardiac', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Cyst', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family suidae', 'Fatty Liver', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interventional Ultrasonography', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Liver diseases', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Needles', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Nonionizing Radiation', 'North America', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Overweight', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Readability', 'Resolution', 'Retroperitoneal Space', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surgical Instruments', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical effect', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'fetal', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'imaging scientist', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metallicity', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'signal processing', 'tool']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,195128,807432003,-0.003949835772968807
"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carolyn Hendrickson, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Hendrickson is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented research of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a focus on the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This K23 award will provide Dr. Hendrickson with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert clinical and translational researcher in ARDS after traumatic injury; (2) to study the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after TBI involving platelet biology, endothelial activation, and lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation; (3) to implement advanced analyses of complex observational data, including machine learning; (4) to develop an independent translational research career. Dr. Hendrickson's plan to achieve these goals is supported by a multidisciplinary mentoring team of experts. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Matthay, has extensive experience in translational ARDS research and in the career development of early stage investigators. Dr. Hendrickson will work with four co-mentors: Dr. Mitchell Cohen, a translational researcher studying coagulation after trauma, Dr. Alan Hubbard, a biostatistician specializing in causal inference, Dr. Geoffrey Manley, a neurosurgeon and leading investigator in TBI research, and Dr. Mark Looney, an expert platelet biology and lung injury. The development of ARDS after TBI is common and is associated with worse neurological outcomes. The biologic mechanisms driving ARDS after TBI are poorly understood. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the risk of ARDS after TBI is mediated through activated vascular endothelium and platelets as well as non-protective mechanical ventilation strategies that use large tidal volumes. Dr. Hendrickson will investigate these causal pathways utilizing previously collected data and plasma from an ongoing observational cohort study. In this same cohort she will prospectively collect biospecimens, detailed mechanical ventilation data, and lung ultrasound images. This proposal represents an innovative approach to studying ARDS after TBI using carefully adjudicated exposures and outcomes. Dr. Hendrickson will test whether plasma biomarkers of endothelial activation, vascular permeability, and inflammation (Aim 1) and platelet function, activation, and aggregation (Aim 2) are associated with ARDS after TBI. She will collect lung ultrasound images and frequent mechanical ventilation data including tidal volumes and plateau pressures. She will test whether early exposure to non-protective mechanical ventilation is associated with ARDS after TBI (Aim 3). Addressing this gap in knowledge may lead to interventions that prevent ARDS and improve outcomes in this patient population. The research and training outlined in this proposal will form the basis for an R01-level proposal designed to study interventions to prevent and treat ARDS after traumatic injury. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because each year in the United States 1.7 million people sustain a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and over 20% of patients with severe isolated TBI develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a form of serious lung disease associated with poor neurological outcomes after TBI. Identification of biologic factors and mechanical ventilation parameters that contribute to ARDS pathogenesis after TBI is the first step in a continuum of research that will pave the way to prevention, personalized risk assessment, improved early management, and targeted treatments for ARDS in patients with TBI. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms of disease in this vulnerable population will expand the understanding of lung injury pathogenesis after a variety of traumatic injuries and perhaps in other high-risk populations.","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation",9747350,K23HL133495,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Angiopoietin-2', 'Animals', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Flow Cytometry', 'Blood Platelets', 'Body Weight', 'California', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Endothelium', 'Enrollment', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-8', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mediating', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Platelet Activation', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Supportive care', 'TBI Patients', 'TIMP3 gene', 'Testing', 'Thrombelastography', 'Thromboxane B2', 'Tidal Volume', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic injury', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'Vascular Permeabilities', 'Ventilator-induced lung injury', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung injury', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient population', 'platelet function', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'stem', 'training opportunity', 'translational scientist']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2019,199098,685608202,0.017364126567690874
"Mobile bedside ultrasound for the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia in resource limited settings Project Summary In low and middle-income countries (LMICs) pneumonia is by far the leading cause of death among children < 5 years of age. Despite progress in reducing global pneumonia deaths, pneumonia still kills over 1 million children a year. A key factor is the challenge of pneumonia diagnosis. Chest X-Ray is the gold standard for pneumonia diagnoses but exposes children to ionizing radiation and is mainly restricted to hospital settings. Outside of hospitals, pneumonia is diagnosed based on clinical grounds using the WHO’s Integrated Management of Childhood Illness algorithms. However, that approach lacks specificity, resulting in significant overdiagnosis of pneumonia. That wastes precious resources, exposes children to antibiotics unnecessarily, and delays identification of the true cause of a child’s illness. Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in bedside ultrasound as a radiation-sparing alternative to X- Ray. The accuracy of bedside US for diagnosing pneumonia is comparable to X-Ray. However, traditional bedside US suffers the same limitations as X-Rays in terms of portability, and still requires interpretation of images by a trained radiologist. Recent innovations in ultrasound technology and artificial intelligence applications suggest a possible pathway forward. Bluetooth enabled US transponders that connect to a smart phone or tablet, effectively create a truly portable US suite that can fit into one’s pocket. Similarly, advances in artificial intelligence render possible the automated interpretation of mobile bedside US (mBSUS) images on a smart phone, obviating the need for a radiologist. The twin goals of this project are: 1) to compare the accuracy of the mobile, Bluetooth US system, linked to a cell phone, against the gold standard of Chest X-Ray for diagnosis of pneumonia among children aged 1-59 months; and 2) to apply machine learning algorithms to assist in the identification of accurate classification features that reliably identify lobar pneumonia. If successful, this would be a pivotal first step towards the goal of a truly portable yet still highly accurate approach to the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia that could function autonomously without the need for external evaluation by a skilled radiologist. Such a tool would revolutionize pneumonia case management in resource limited parts of the world and could save the lives of many. Project Narrative Pneumonia remains the leading cause of death for children <5 years around the world. A key barrier is the lack of affordable and portable imaging systems. In this project, we will 1) test the accuracy of a mobile ultrasound system that connects to a smart phone via blue tooth against the gold standard of chest X-Ray, and 2) use machine learning algorithms to automate the diagnosis of pneumonia, thereby obviating the need for external review by a radiologist.",Mobile bedside ultrasound for the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia in resource limited settings,9773427,R21TW011343,"['5 year old', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Aorta', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blinded', 'Bluetooth', 'Breast Feeding', 'Breathing', 'Case Management', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest wall structure', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Convulsions', 'Coughing', 'Cyanosis', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Head', 'Heart', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Lethargies', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pediatric Radiologist', 'Pleura', 'Pneumococcal Pneumonia', 'Pneumonia', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Regional Anatomy', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Diaphragm', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Ultrasonography', 'Unconscious State', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vomiting', 'Zambia', 'aged', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'drinking', 'health training', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'low and middle-income countries', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'portability', 'radiologist', 'smartphone Application', 'tool', 'wasting']",FIC,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R21,2019,199220,164685352,-0.02260128479252509
"Optimizing anti-epileptic drug treatment in acute brain injury Project Summary/Abstract Dr. Zafar is a neurointensivist and clinical neurophysiologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital, whose goal is to become an independent investigator with expertise in comparative effectiveness research and pragmatic clinical trials using neurophysiologic tools, to improve outcomes in patients with acute brain injuries and seizures. Epileptiform abnormalities (seizures and seizure-like rhythmic patterns) are seen on electroencephalography (EEG) in up to 40% of acute brain injury patients and are associated with worse outcomes. Due to lack of evidence-based guidance, patients with epileptiform abnormalities are often aggressively treated with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), exposing them to AED related adverse effects that may worsen outcomes. Dr. Zafar's preliminary data shows that increasing burden of epileptiform abnormalities in patients with hemorrhagic stroke is associated with worse outcomes. Up to half these patients receive AED treatment with no improvement in outcomes, and AED use itself is independently associated with worse outcomes. Dr. Zafar has built a comprehensive EEG database of 2000 patients to investigate AED effectiveness. In her career development plan, she will be using the rich neurophysiologic data in the EEG database, along with a nationwide dataset (Premier Healthcare Database) to study AED and EEG utilization patterns and AED effectiveness in a “real-clinical world” setting. Under the mentorship of Dr. M. Bradon Westover, and co-mentors (Dr. John Hsu, Dr. Elisabetta Patorno, and Dr. Hang Lee), Dr. Zafar proposes to: 1) Determine which specific epileptiform abnormalities show an acute response to AEDs by assessing neurological improvement within 24 hours of treatment (EEG database), 2) Assess the impact of AEDs on in- hospital clinical adverse outcomes and discharge functional outcomes in acute brain injury patients with epileptiform abnormalities (EEG database), 3) Investigate how AED-related adverse outcomes vary with practice patterns across hospitals with different resources and EEG utilization patterns (Premier Database). Dr. Zafar will perform a systematic exploration of the EEG database to determine EEG phenotypes associated with response to AED treatment, and determine the impact of AEDs on in-hospital adverse outcomes (e.g. mortality, hepatotoxicity, cardiac events). To account for national variation in AED prescription, hospital resources and EEG use, Dr. Zafar will examine adverse outcomes in the Premier Database. In addition to the proposed research, Dr. Zafar's career development plan includes a Masters of Science and coursework on analysis of large databases, pharmacoepidemiology and machine learning. Dr. Zafar will receive guidance from her mentors and advisors with diverse clinical and scientific expertise. The proposed training will allow Dr. Zafar to establish a niche in using neurophysiologic data in comparative effectiveness research and launch an independent research career aimed at improving neurologic outcomes in patients with acute brain injuries. Project Narrative Although patients admitted with brain injuries such as stroke and traumatic brain injury are at high risk for developing seizures, physicians have very limited information to guide anti-epileptic drug management in such patients. This results in frequent overuse of anti-epileptic mediations that are also known to have harmful side effects. Dr. Zafar's proposed project will significantly advance our knowledge on which patients benefit the most from treatment and which patients are at highest risk for harmful side effects, providing guidance for physicians in making treatment decisions that will improve outcomes in the thousands of brain injury patients admitted to US hospitals each year.",Optimizing anti-epileptic drug treatment in acute brain injury,9871037,K23NS114201,"['Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'General Hospitals', 'Glasgow Coma Scale', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Master of Science', 'Mediation', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological Models', 'Neurological outcome', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Seizures', 'Severity of illness', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Variant', 'active comparator', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'comparative effectiveness', 'disorder subtype', 'effectiveness research', 'evidence base', 'functional outcomes', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'mortality', 'neurophysiology', 'patient subsets', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'side effect', 'skills', 'stroke patient', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2019,200880,551214295,-0.03458950667723043
"Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This career development award will provide early career support for investigation of the management of infec- tious diseases in the setting of addiction in hospitals. The award will provide support for the candidate to develop expertise in the following areas: 1) addiction science research; 2) natural language processing; 3) machine learn- ing; 4) professional development; and 5) responsible conduct of research. For this, Dr. Goodman-Meza will be mentored by a multidisciplinary, cross-institutional team with expertise in addiction, infectious diseases, and data science. His primary mentor, Dr. Steve Shoptaw, has an extensive track record in addiction-related research and training of future independent investigators. His co-mentors include Dr. Alex Bui and Dr. Matthew B. Goetz. Dr. Bui is an expert in biomedical data science and heads NIH training programs in this field. Dr. Goetz has broad experience of productive infectious diseases clinical research within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The current opioid epidemic in the United States has been associated with an increase in infections, in particular hepatitis C and bacterial infections. Bacterial infections are the leading infectious diagnosis leading to hospitali- zation in individuals with an opioid use disorder (OUD), and incur significant healthcare expenditures. Despite the availability of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) in the form of methadone or buprenorphine, less than 20% of people with OUD actually receive OAT. Hospitalization for a bacterial infection may be an ideal time to initiate OAT, but the benefits of this practice are unknown. In this proposal, the candidate will assess the impact of initiating OAT in people who inject opioids admitted to the VHA due to a Staphylococcus aureus blood stream infection (bacteremia) – the most common bacterial pathogen among people who inject opioids. Using data already collected for 36,868 cases of S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) from the VHA electronic data repository, the candidate will address three research questions: 1) is a natural language processing algorithm (NLP) more ac- curate than a standard International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code-based approach at screening records to correctly identify individuals who inject opioids in a cohort of patients admitted with SAB; 2) what are the temporal and geographic trends of SAB in people who inject opioids and those who receive OAT at the facility- level; and 3) using a machine learning framework, what are the estimated impacts of OAT on patient centered outcomes – death, readmissions, leaving against medical advice, and subsequent outpatient engagement in OAT. These formative data will help the candidate to establish a productive early career as a physician-scientist and advise development of an OAT-delivery strategy to mitigate infectious complications of injection opioid use. Through this award, Dr. Goodman-Meza will establish himself as an expert physician-scientist at the intersection of infectious disease and addiction, poised to make significant contributions to this important area of medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Serious, life-threatening bacterial infections in people who inject drugs are increasing with the current national opioid epidemic. Hospitalization of people who use opioids for treatment of infectious complications may be an ideal time to initiate opioid agonist therapy (OAT), an evidence-based practice that has been historically underuti- lized. This project will use innovative data science methods to estimate the impact of initiating OAT in the hospital for patients with a history of opioid injection admitted for treatment of blood stream infections caused by Staph- ylococcus aureus in the Veterans Health Administration.",Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections,9721752,K08DA048163,"['Acute suppurative arthritis due to bacteria', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Behavior', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Research', 'Coagulation Process', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Outcome', 'Distant', 'Drug usage', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Embolism', 'Endocarditis', 'Epidemic', 'Equipment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'HIV risk', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C Transmission', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immunosuppression', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injecting drug user', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Life', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Predisposition', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Services', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Travel', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans', 'Water', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'blood treatment', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'cohort', 'data format', 'data warehouse', 'efficacy testing', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health administration', 'heroin use', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'injection drug use', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid injection', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic virus', 'prescription opioid', 'responsible research conduct', 'screening', 'skin microbiota', 'time interval', 'treatment services', 'trend', 'viral transmission']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K08,2019,203040,673201228,-0.002406442997536811
"Distinguishing Lipid Subtypes by Amplifying Contrast from J-Coupling Project Summary/Abstract With the global rise in obesity-related diseases and increasing recognition of the role of fat in diseases such as fatty liver, there is growing need for a noninvasive chemical assay of in vivo lipid depots. But the rich chemistry of these molecules is often ignored in MRI, which typically treats fat as a homogeneous proton species because differences in chemical shift and relaxation are difficult to distinguish in a clinical setting. Innovation: This proposal will be the first to use nonuniform echo spacing to generate J-coupling based contrast between chemically different fats. While fat spins often give monotonically decaying signal under a uniformly spaced spin echo train, J-coupling causes nonuniformly spaced spin echo trains to generate complex fingerprints, which distinguish and even quantify fats with otherwise similar MR properties. Significance: The immediate clinical impact will be to demonstrate a novel J-coupling based contrast mechanism in vivo which will contribute to a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish the 25% of the population with benign steatosis from the 2-3% with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The broader significance of this work is that this novel contrast mechanism could revolutionize the study and clinical management of many diseases associated with bioactive lipid subtypes. Approach: The aims are designed to test the hypothesis that nonuniform echo trains (1) can create contrast between different fats, which (2) will contribute to a multiparametric noninvasive protocol to distinguish benign steatosis and NASH. Aim 1 will identify the echo spacing best suited for distinguishing benign steatosis and NASH, first using density matrix simulations based on high resolution spectra of liver fat from animals with each disease, and then using experiments on whole rat livers. In Aim 2, the sequence developed in Aim 1 will be tested in humans with biopsy proven benign steatosis or NASH, along with a suite of standard methods of liver and fat characterization. This metric, and also metrics derived from conventional images, will be tested for the ability to separate these patient groups. In addition, machine learning algorithms will be used to find a metric that combines multiecho intensities with standard MR metrics. This proposal will prove the usefulness of nonuniform echo trains as a new contrast mechanism and yield a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish simple steatosis and NASH. Moreover, this general approach to distinguish fats could ultimately find a broad range of biomedical applications, such as imaging lipid based therapeutics, distinguishing the 4 fatty acids that make up 90% of the adipose stores, or detecting other lipotoxic subtypes. The results of this work will justify a larger scale study to properly validate the sensitivity to different fat species in humans. Project Narrative This proposal will prove the usefulness of nonuniform echo trains both as a new J-coupling based contrast mechanism and as part of a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish simple steatosis (~25% of the population) from patients on the NASHfibrosiscirrhosis trajectory of metabolically induced liver disease (2- 3% of the population). Moreover, this general approach to distinguish fats could ultimately find a broad range of biomedical applications, such as imaging lipid based therapeutics, distinguishing the 4 fatty acids that make up 90% of the adipose stores, or detecting other lipotoxic subtypes. The results of this work will justify a larger scale study to properly validate the sensitivity to different fat species in humans.",Distinguishing Lipid Subtypes by Amplifying Contrast from J-Coupling,9782953,R21EB023414,"['Adipose tissue', 'Animals', 'Benign', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fibrosis', 'Fingerprint', 'Human', 'Image', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Matched Group', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Obesity associated disease', 'Oils', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Rattus', 'Relaxation', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Work', 'age group', 'analog', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'liver imaging', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'sex', 'simulation', 'trend']",NIBIB,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,209375,550947887,-0.0052442606613473585
"Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers Project Summary Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) has been proposed as a technique to quantify tissue parameters, such as T1 and T2 relaxation times, which are biomarkers for various pathologies. One assumption of MRF is that the signal in each voxel is generated by exactly one set of tissue parameters. Due to MRI resolution at the range of millimeter in combination with the cellular structure of biological tissue, each voxel consists of multiple tissue compartments. An over-simplified single compartment model results in apparent relaxation times that are influenced by the relaxation times and the fractional proton densities of all contributing compartments. This can lead to a misinterpretation of signal changes. For example, in diseases that causes demyelination in white matter (Multiple Sclerosis, Dementia), a reduction of the myelin water fraction would result in a misleading change of the apparent relaxation time of the voxel. We propose a multi-compartment MRF method that allows to identify multiple tissue contributions within a voxel, including the fractional proton density (PD) of different compartments. Our machine learning based approach automatically identifies the number of compartments within each voxel that can be identified with the available SNR in that voxel. We will correct for partial-volume effects at the borders of two types of tissues, as well as analyze tissue microstructure. For the second case our learned model will also include chemical exchange between compartments. After an initial validation phase using numerical simulations, we will first perform MRF scans of dedicated 3D printed phantoms with multiple compartments. Our quality criterion is successful estimation of all simulated tissue compartments for all voxels with a relative error of less than 5% to the ground truth. We will then perform in-vivo MRF measurements of healthy volunteers (n=5). We will generate synthetic FLAIR and MP-RAGE contrasts from parameter maps estimated with conventional and the proposed multi-compartment MRF technique. We will compare them with currently used clinical contrasts acquired using established pulse sequences and validate the performance of our approach by measuring the cortical thickness. Further, we will validate the performance for microstructure composition in white matter. Our hypothesis is that it will be possible separate the compartments for myelin, intra- and extra-cellular water and compare the results to ex-vivo data found in literature. In summary, the methods developed in this R21 proposal will provide a novel technique to accurately and reproducibly identify biomarkers beyond the resolution of a voxel. It will allow to identify changes in tissue composition and fractional proton density at the microstructure level. Project Narrative The overarching goal of this proposal is to establish a MR imaging technique for quantifying biomarkers at the sub-voxel level. We will develop a machine learning based MR fingerprinting image reconstruction that enables the identification and characterization of multiple compartments within a voxel in terms of fractional proton density and relaxation times. We will generate accurate synthetic fluid suppressed images such as the FLAIR and MP- RAGE with accurate partial volume behavior and analyze the myelin water fraction and the corresponding relaxation times in white matter.",Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers,9825278,R21EB027241,"['3D Print', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Demyelinations', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Fingerprint', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Protons', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Water', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'gray matter', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'millimeter', 'neuroimaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'physical process', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'tissue biomarkers', 'white matter']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2019,209851,329565273,-0.01103067467829661
"In Vivo Mapping of Uncharted Functional Units of Tongue Motion During Speech Project Summary Tongue cancer and the treatments used to cure the disease such as glossectomy can have debilitating effects on speech and swallowing, yet not much is known about the relationship between tongue movements in speech and reconstruction choices after cancer resection. The tongue’s vital role in speaking and swallowing is executed by a uniquely complex array of muscles which deform locally into functional units. Tongue movements are governed by synergistic activation of these functional units using orthogonally oriented muscle fibers not a rigid skeletal structure. Functional units, which are regions of 3D coherent motion, are the structures that link low-level muscle activity to high-level surface tongue geometry. This link, the organization of functional units, can provide considerable insight into normal motor control and adapted tongue motion, as in patients who have had surgery for tongue cancer. However, there is poor understanding of the details of how muscle morphology contributes to function due to tongue muscle interdigitation and complex local activation. A key to understanding the relationship between the structure and function of the tongue is to identify functional units of motion in localized tongue regions and map them to muscle anatomy. A large step in this direction can be gained by developing a tool to cluster 3D coherent motion patterns from tagged MRI, and register them to muscle anatomy from high-resolution MRI. Speech motor control is a critical area of importance where platform tools for machine learning techniques are lacking. The goal of this project is to create a framework to relate the functional units to tongue muscle anatomy. This framework will enhance tongue motion analysis in medical research and clinical applications, where MRI is frequently used. To address this goal, we have already developed technologies to analyze high-resolution and tagged-MRI. The first is a detailed 3D muscle atlas based on 3D high-resolution MRI, which depicts the locations of both extrinsic and intrinsic muscles, and will be registered to each speaker to identify and track their muscles in the 3D tagged data sets. The second is software to derive 3D displacement and strain fields from tagged MR images. These displacements, strains, and derived quantities will be used to extract spatio-temporal feature vectors that define coherent regions, which will be verified with simulation. The vectors will then be input into a novel computational method using a NMF and clustering, the goal of which is to establish the functional units of speech. In addition, biomechanical simulations will be used to co-validate our findings. The concept of functional units is at the core of the proposed work, as it can provide insights into tongue muscle coordination in patients after glossectomy surgery. The research plan comprises two specific aims: (1) develop a computational method to establish functional units from MRI and (2) determine the relationship between alterations in anatomy and alterations in functional unit motion after tongue cancer treatment. Linking the functional units to the anatomy will allow the design of more focused treatments and therapies for tongue motion-related disorders. Project Narrative Functions of the tongue—speaking, eating, and breathing—are executed by using a complex muscular array to create global motions (synergies) by deforming local functional units which are intermediate structures that link muscle activity to surface tongue geometry. This project will develop new computational tools that will enable researchers and clinicians to determine the functional units of specific motions and relate them to the muscle anatomy. Such a breakthrough will dramatically improve our knowledge of the mechanisms of muscle coordination, thereby permitting improvement of diagnosis and treatment of tongue motion-related disorders.",In Vivo Mapping of Uncharted Functional Units of Tongue Motion During Speech,9636557,R21DC016047,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Bone structure', 'Breathing', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Elements', 'Excision', 'Geometry', 'Gestures', 'Glossectomy', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Fibers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Therapy', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Extracts', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Treatment-Related Cancer', 'Unit of Measure', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical application', 'computational basis', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'digital', 'functional independence', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'malignant tongue neoplasm', 'motor control', 'multidimensional data', 'muscular structure', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predict clinical outcome', 'reconstruction', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'synergism', 'theories', 'tool', 'vector']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2019,210725,551214295,-0.08017082695397815

The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9747894,K01ES026835,"['Affect', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Drug-sensitive', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural Genes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'pathogen genomics', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIEHS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K01,2019,215352,178569161,-0.004766401168269072
"Automated end-to-end retinal screening system with robotic image capture and deep learning analysis Abstract  In this SBIR project, we propose EyeScreenBot, an end-to-end automated retinal im- age capture and analysis system, comprising a self-driven, robotic fundus camera plat- form for automated image capture and a deep learning-based image analysis engine for generation of automated screening outcome. With the large, growing, and aging popula- tion and the increased prevalence of diabetes, a large number of people are at risk for vision loss due to several eye diseases including diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and glaucoma. Although eye screening is effective in re- ducing vision loss, there are not enough clinical personnel and eye-care experts for pop- ulation-wide eye screening. Recent advances with automated image analysis are helping alleviate the situation, but they are still limited by the need for good quality images of the patients captured by trained technicians or expensive retinal cameras equipped for auto- mated capture. EyeScreenBot will be developed to provide a truly end-to-end screening solution that is cost-effective and suitable for deployment in primary care clinics or op- tometrist sites, addressing both automated capture and subsequent automated analysis, all without the need for trained technicians or eye experts at the point of care. When deployed and commercialized, this device will rapidly aid scaling of eye screening for the masses, thereby having an enormous impact in improving the quality and accessibility of eye care and helping reduce preventable vision loss. Narrative EyeScreenBot, an end-to-end automated screening system with intelligent image capture and analysis, will truly enable eye screening at massive scale, which is necessary and urgent since the population at risk for preventable vision loss due to retinal diseases (such as diabetic retinopathy) is growing at a staggering rate. Triaging and identification of at-risk patients will allow for timely intervention to prevent, slow, or even reverse the disease progression and loss of vision.",Automated end-to-end retinal screening system with robotic image capture and deep learning analysis,9847891,R43EY029652,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Blindness', 'California', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'County', 'Coupled', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Progression', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Fundus photography', 'Generations', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Los Angeles', 'Manuals', 'Mass Screening', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Pupil', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'aging population', 'automated analysis', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'diabetic', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'fundus imaging', 'improved', 'interest', 'macula', 'point of care', 'portability', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'retinal imaging', 'robot interface', 'robotic system', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NEI,"EYENUK, INC.",R43,2019,218618,1300000,-0.018079269454767195
"Quantitative Renal Imaging for Kidney Diseases Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Angiography (CEMRA) with gadolinium (Gd) provides high resolution visualization of the vascular compartment, but is rarely used in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73m2) due to the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). There is thus an unmet need to develop MRI techniques that can both replace Gd and provide new insights into the etiology and severity of CKD.  PI Sridhar and his team at Northeastern University (NEU) have developed a new technique, Quantitative Ultra-short Time-to-Echo Contrast-Enhanced (QUTE-CE) MRI, leads to quantifiable positive contrast images of the vasculature with unprecedented clarity and definition. QUTE-CE is particularly optimal using Ferumoxytol (Feraheme), an FDA approved iron-oxide nanopharmaceutical, that is already routinely used for iron-deficient anemia therapy in CKD patients. Under an ongoing clinical trial (NCT03266848) we have demonstrated QUTE- CE MRI for renal and cerebral imaging in humans at 3T.  This R21 project will develop the QUTE-CE MRI method for kidney imaging in patients with both normal kidney function as well as with CKD. We propose to scan 25 total patients (10 in Year 1 and 15 in Year 2) who are already scheduled to receive ferumoxytol infusion for iron-deficiency anemia therapy. The specific aims of this project are summarized below. Specific Aim 1: Renal Vascular Angiograms of CKD Patients. These studies will be conducted at NEU and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) using Siemens Prisma MRI scanners. Three tasks will be pursued to develop the optimizing protocol. Task 1: Develop a robust QUTE-CE imaging protocol. Task 2: Implement a robust methodology for accounting for B1 inhomogeneity. Task 3: Develop a robust trajectory for improved image reconstruction including motion correction. We hypothesize that QUTE-CE MRI will lead to high resolution angiograms that will allow for the safe diagnosis of existing pathologies such as renal artery stenosis in addition to the novel identification of kidney micro-vascular disease. Specific Aim 2: Obtain quantitative renal blood volume (RBV) maps and develop machine learning algorithms (MLA) to better understand the severity of kidney disease. The renal angiograms will be analyzed to obtain renal blood volume (RBV) maps. The RBV maps will be analyzed in terms of Machine-Learning algorithms (MLA) to explore whether we can identify common etiologies of CKD as well as estimate the severity of kidney disease. The MLA will enable organ segmentation, automatized renal parenchyma volumetry, as well as automated extraction and labeling of lesions. The MLA results will be compared with radiological scoring, estimated GFR, and degree of albuminuria. We hypothesize that the absolute RBV maps will enable quantitative monitoring of blood volume in cortex and medulla, and that RBV could be a surrogate parameter for renal microvascular rarefaction, a central mechanism in CKD initiation and progression. PROJECT NARRATIVE TITLE: Quantitative Renal Imaging for Kidney Disease This project will develop a quantitative magnetic resonance imaging technique QUTE-CE MRI for studies of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The QUTE-CE MRI methodology provides very clear and high resolution angiographic images of vasculature using a safe and clinically approved nanoparticle contrast agent, that will transform standard of care by enabling diagnostic imaging for a large population of patients with CKD who cannot be imaged with the current gadolinium contrast agent due to its toxicity.",Quantitative Renal Imaging for Kidney Diseases,9824779,R21DK118449,"['Accounting', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'Anemia', 'Angiography', 'Arteries', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood Volume', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Cyst', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Etiology', 'FDA approved', 'Gadolinium', 'Gaussian model', 'General Hospitals', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Infusion procedures', 'Iodine', 'Iron', 'Iron deficiency anemia', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic nanoparticles', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis\xa0', 'Nephrology', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Proteinuria', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Toxicity', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Renal Artery Stenosis', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Severities', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Veins', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'clinical imaging', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'expectation', 'ferumoxytol', 'high risk', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrument', 'iron oxide', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney imaging', 'kidney vascular structure', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanodrug', 'nanoparticle', 'novel', 'nuclear imaging', 'patient population', 'prisma', 'prognostic', 'standard of care']",NIDDK,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,220889,38247784,0.006990698054735853
"Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI Project Summary/Abstract Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) provides arguably the most comprehensive evaluation of the cardiovascular system; however, respiratory motion continues to adversely impact CMR, causing artifacts that lead to poor image quality, repeated scans, and decreased throughput, and thus represents a significant obstacle to clinical utility. For single-shot CMR, cardiac and breathing motions are “frozen” by limiting the acquisition to an end-diastolic window less than 200 ms. For first pass perfusion, breathing motion cannot be eliminated because data from 50 to 60 consecutive heartbeats are required to capture contrast dynamics. For other single-shot applications such as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and parameter mapping, respiratory motion is introduced when the acquisition is repeated across several heartbeats to improve spatial and temporal resolution. To eliminate respiratory motion from single-shot images, non-rigid motion correction (MOCO) has been promoted as an attractive option that provides 100% acquisition efficiently. MOCO can be used either after the reconstruction or during the reconstruction. Such techniques, however, cannot account for through-plane motion, which can only be corrected prospectively, and can fail depending on image quality and the extent of motion. Prospective compensation of the respiratory motion has been recognized as an attractive alternative to existing gating and MOCO methods. Proposed methods use one or more navigator echoes—incompatible with or inefficient for many CMR protocols—to capture the respiratory motion and rely on simple parametric models that are inadequate to describe complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion. Due to these limitations, prospective methods have found limited applicability even in research settings. We propose a new framework to prospectively compensate respiratory motion. The proposed method, called PROspective Motion compensation using Pilot Tone (PROMPT), employs Pilot Tone technology and leverages machine learning principles to first learn complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion on a patient-specific basis and then prospectively compensate the motion by tracking the imaging plane, in real time, as a function of a Pilot Tone based respiratory signal. If successful, this synergistic combination of Pilot Tone and machine learning will lead to 100% efficiency for single-shot CMR exams performed under free-breathing conditions, will eliminate the need to setup navigator echoes, respiratory bellows, or other inefficient prospective gating measures, will minimize through-plane motion that can render the images non-diagnostic for CMR applications including fast-pass perfusion, parameter mapping, LGE, and coronary angiography, will provide a reliable surrogate measure of respiratory motion, and will facilitate highly accelerated compressive recovery. Project Narrative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has many potential advantages over currently used imaging methods to diagnose heart disease, but MRI images can be ruined if the patient breathes during the scan. In this project, we will develop a method that is insensitive to breathing motion and compare it to existing methods. These efforts should lead to significant improvements in diagnosis of heart disease so that patients may benefit from appropriate treatment.",Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI,9762101,R21EB026657,"['Anatomy', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Freezing', 'Gadolinium', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'healthy volunteer', 'heart motion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,223680,241268189,0.012643845922877716
"Development and Evaluation of a Machine Learning Approach to Interpret Optical Coherence Tomography Images of the Middle Ear to Improve Antibiotic Management PROJECT SUMMARY Introduction: PhotoniCare, Inc. is a medical device company developing the TOMi Scope, a handheld, optical imaging device for improved diagnosis of middle ear health. The purpose of this proposal is to establish and evaluate a machine learning approach to interpret TOMi Scope depth-resolved images using a set of ear models with human middle ear effusion (MEE; fluid) to enable improved diagnostic accuracy and, ultimately, antibiotic stewardship for ear health. Significance: Ear infections affect 95% of all children, yet they are one of the most poorly diagnosed and managed diseases in all of medicine, resulting in high antibiotic over-prescription and antibiotic resistance development. Correctly identifying the absence or presence/type of MEE through the non-transparent eardrum is critical to accurate diagnosis, and the limited current diagnostic tools suffer poor diagnostic accuracy (50- 70%) due to inherent subjectivity and dependence on user experience. Therefore, objective image classification metrics to enable improved diagnostic accuracy is sorely needed to finally provide children afflicted by this disease with the correct treatment the first time. Hypothesis: Applying a machine learning approach to TOMi Scope image classification of a set of ear models with human MEE will facilitate detection of the presence or absence of effusion (≥90% accuracy), as well as classification by the type of effusion samples (≥80% accuracy), regardless of user experience. Specific Aims: (1) Collect robust datasets of ex vivo human MEE, sufficient for machine learning image analysis. (2) Develop a neural network model based on the MEE dataset and apply the model to a representative test clinical dataset to determine classification feasibility. Commercial Opportunity: The TOMi Scope will provide physicians with new, objective information, enabling better decision-making for antibiotic prescription and surgical intervention. This has the potential to impact the standard of care for ~1B children worldwide that experience ear infections, representing a multi-billion-dollar commercial opportunity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ear infections (otitis media) are highly prevalent in the pediatric population and represent a significant clinical challenge due to the limitations of the gold-standard diagnostic tools, resulting in high antibiotic prescription but also antibiotic resistance development. Accurate detection and classification of effusion (fluid) in the middle ear is a critical element for this diagnosis, and for making informed medical treatment decisions, particularly regarding antibiotic stewardship. The long-term goal of this work is to reduce antibiotic resistance and healthcare costs through improving patient outcomes by addressing the low diagnostic accuracy and user experience dependence of current subjective methods, with a novel, non-invasive imaging tool capable of quantitative depth-resolved measurements to not only visualize the underlying infection behind the eardrum, but also, with automated machine learning image analysis algorithms, minimize user experience dependence and variability.",Development and Evaluation of a Machine Learning Approach to Interpret Optical Coherence Tomography Images of the Middle Ear to Improve Antibiotic Management,9847606,R43DC017422,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ear', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Family suidae', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Infection', 'Intestines', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Otitis Media', 'Otitis Media with Effusion', 'Otoscopy', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient observation', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Pythons', 'Resistance development', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Serous', 'Sterility', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'TensorFlow', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tympanic membrane', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'ear infection', 'effusion', 'ex vivo imaging', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'middle ear', 'neural network', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'pediatric patients', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDCD,"PHOTONICARE, INC.",R43,2019,223899,1136886,-0.015465909462205645
"Integrated Microbial Screening and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infections Abstract COMBiNATi will work with Stanford University to bring the world’s first integrated ID+AST UTI diagnostic platform to the market by combining COMBiNATi’s “one-click” cost-effective dPCR platform with Stanford’s pathogen identification (ID) HRMA algorithm for broad detection, deep characterization and absolute quantification of UTI pathogens. By the end of the Phase 1 project, we will deliver the prototype instrument for ID and AST, scale-ready consumables for dPCR + HRM and culture + qPCR, machine-learning software algorithm for melt curve analysis, and prove the feasibility by identifying and quantifying the top two urinary tract infection bacteria. We will first develop two consumables: an 100k partition ID chip and a 32-lane, 10k partition per lane AST plate based on the micro-injection molding design rules established by COMBiNATi. An integrated system with thermal control and imaging capability will then be developed for HRM and qPCR processes. The prototype system will then be transferred to Stanford University where mock samples including both isolated bacteria and contrived urine samples will be tested on the platform for integrated pathogen ID and AST determination. Narrative Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is one of the most common community-acquired bacterial infection. However, like other bacterial infections, standard culture-based diagnosis of UTI requires at least 2-3 days from sample acquisition to result reporting. Despite technological advancements, the process remains time- consuming and requires significant technical expertise. Automated instruments remain bulky and still require clonal isolation of the pathogens from the body fluid samples prior to AST. Additionally, the lack of definitive microbiological diagnosis that is rapid enough to achieve evidence-based treatment has driven the over- and misuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics. We believe the proposed integrated ID + AST platform has the potential to enable deep genetic analyses of clinical samples to provide rapid precision UTI triage and MIC determination in a timely and cost-efficient manner to positively impact patient care as well as promote the use of narrow spectrum antibiotics to favorably impact antibiotic resistance profiles.",Integrated Microbial Screening and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infections,9777415,R41AI145604,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Ampicillin', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Body Fluids', 'Ceftriaxone', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Ciprofloxacin', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Genomic DNA', 'Gentamicins', 'Growth', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Laboratories', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microfluidics', 'Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Molecular', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Resistance profile', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Uropathogen', 'Work', 'base', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'digital', 'genetic analysis', 'imaging capabilities', 'instrument', 'melting', 'microbial', 'operation', 'pathogen', 'prototype', 'response', 'scale up', 'screening', 'success']",NIAID,"COMBINATI, INC.",R41,2019,224658,599695,-0.005692791167769394
"New instrument and methods for fast, diagnostic-quality histology of un-embedded bone marrow and lymph node specimens Project Summary Over 600,000 bone marrow biopsies are performed every year in the United States, while hundreds of thousands more lymph node biospies are performed. Histological evaluation of these biopsies is a critical component of care for hematologic diseases including leukemia, lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative disease and non-neoplastic conditions such as viral infections and autoimmune conditions.  We have developed a platform that we consider a paradigm shift in the histologic examination of tissues. It is based on a new chemical process, imaging, and image processing approach that we have dubbed Clearing Histology with MultiPhoton microscopy (CHiMP).The CHiMP technology enables visual analysis of entire intact, un-embedded and uncut specimens within a short time-frame and with a resolution that is amenable to primary diagnosis. The significant clinical benefits include: 1) potential for same-day diagnosis, 2) labor and cost savings, 3) access to 3D perspective, 4) increased visual data from same specimen, 5) complete tissue preservation for ancillary studies such as DNA analysis and 6) inherent benefits of digital data such as reduced risk of loss, ready remote review by experts, and amenability to machine learning tools. Hematopoietic tissue evaluation would similarly benefit from these advantages, but unfortunately the systems developed thus far lack the resolution typically needed for visual examination of hematopoietic tissues.  For this Phase I SBIR proposal, an objective is to develop customized optics to improve the resolution of our current microscopes and thereby enable use in the specialized field of hematology. Commercially available objective lenses that are compatible with our immersion medium are either limited to numerical apertures (NA) that are less than one, affecting resolution and image quality, or have insufficient working distances for imaging past the coverslip and surface roughness to obtain complete sections. We will design and test a custom objective lens with high NA and long working distance, suited for our proprietary reagents. Integrating such a lens into our microscope will also require the design of a custom scan lens, custom beam conditioning optics, and a custom polygon scanner.  An associated goal is to develop a novel approach to preparing bone marrow aspiration specimens that will make them amenable to imaging with CHiMP, potentially reducing the need for core biopsies by permitting unambiguous morphologic categorization of cell subtypes in their architectural context, without the routine need for immunohistochemistry, and while preserving nucleic acids for molecular/genetic evaluation. Project Narrative Applikate Technologies has developed a powerful platform for histological evaluation of tissue called Clearing Histology with MultiPhoton Microscopy, or CHiMP. This platform has many advantages over traditional approaches, including same-day turn-around, reduced labor costs, preservation of tissue for DNA analysis, and direct-to-digital imaging for ease of consultation with remote experts. This proposal seeks to develop custom optics to enable very-high-resolution imaging of bone marrow and lymph node samples that are critical for diagnosing diseases such as leukemia and lymphoma.","New instrument and methods for fast, diagnostic-quality histology of un-embedded bone marrow and lymph node specimens",9677952,R43CA235890,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Ancillary Study', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Aspirate substance', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Biopsy', 'Blinded', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Marrow Aspiration', 'Bone marrow biopsy', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Consultations', 'Consumption', 'Core Biopsy', 'Cost Savings', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA analysis', 'Data', 'Decalcification', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Evaluation', 'Fibrosis', 'Goals', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematology', 'Hematopathology', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Iron', 'Lateral', 'Lymph', 'Machine Learning', 'Marrow', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Myeloproliferative disease', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Optics', 'Pan Genus', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Phase', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'Reagent', 'Recovery', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Slice', 'Slide', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Preservation', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visual', 'Waxes', 'Work', 'base', 'bone imaging', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'disease diagnosis', 'hematopoietic tissue', 'high resolution imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'instrument', 'lens', 'leukemia/lymphoma', 'lymph nodes', 'medical specialties', 'multiphoton microscopy', 'nanoparticle', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'particle', 'pre-clinical', 'preservation', 'second harmonic', 'tool', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,"APPLIKATE TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R43,2019,224713,471891,-0.015167043292829334
"Development of an adaptive machine learning platform for automated analysis of biomarkers in biomedical images ABSTRACT Manual analysis of biomedical images by researchers and pathologists has the potential to introduce bias and error that compromise the reliability of research and clinical findings. These problems are significant barriers to delivering the most beneficial evidence-based medicine, developing effective medical treatments, and promoting confidence in scientific inquiry. Identification of biomarkers and cellular targets following microscopy requires manual analysis of biomedical images, which is time intensive, difficult, and prone to bias and errors. Unintentional bias and attentional limitations during analysis of biomarkers can underlie poor reproducibility of findings in biomedical research and potentially introduce error in clinical diagnostics. We recently developed a “beta” software package designed to improve automation and standardization of image analysis, called “PIPSQUEAK” (Perineuronal net Intensity Program for the Standardization and Quantification of Extracellular matrix Analysis Kit). Since its publication in 2016, PIPSQUEAK beta has amassed approximately 1,300 users worldwide who use it to quantify the intensity and number of perineuronal nets and other neural markers in the brain. This technology significantly increases data reliability between image raters and decreases the time required for analysis by more than 100-fold. However, PIPSQUEAK beta currently uses target detection algorithms that require high-contrast images to automatically identify neurons as clusters of bright pixels on dark backgrounds. A significant current limitation to PIPSQUEAK beta, and other available imaging programs, is that detection of biomarkers can be difficult unless image conditions are ideal. Suboptimal conditions, like high background staining, off-target structures, overlapping or clustered biomarkers, and atypical morphologies, can lead to artifacts and consequently to inaccurate results and erroneous conclusions. Here, we propose to develop a user-friendly artificial intelligence (AI) platform for the automated detection of targeted biomarkers in digital microscopy that reduces this error by learning to distinguish between true cellular biomarkers and artifacts. We propose to integrate AI capabilities into our PIPSQUEAK technology to produce an adaptive, high-throughput, biomedical image analysis platform that quickly and accurately identifies biomarker targets from bench to bedside. A key advantage is that this AI program will be user friendly and available online, making it highly accessible to basic researchers and to technicians and clinicians identifying human pathologies. Thus, successful development of our AI program has a high translational potential. The goal of this proposal is 1) to develop and validate a machine learning model that is capable of detecting common histological marker morphologies in digital microscopy, and 2) to test the feasibility of adapting our AI platform to new biomarker datasets with minimal additional supervised training. Our end goal is to advance the reliability and speed of research findings and clinical diagnoses by making this technology widely available to researchers and clinicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Manual analysis of biomedical images by researchers and pathologists has the potential to introduces bias and error that compromise the reliability of research and clinical findings; problems which are significant barriers to delivering the most beneficial evidence-based medicine and developing effective medical treatments.

"Serum antibody biomarkers of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome Chronic fatigue syndrome is a disabling condition for 2.5 million Americans associated with  prolonged fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and sleep disturbances. The cause of CFS remains  unknown, and there are currently no available diagnostic tests to confirm disease. However, a  substantial number of immune features have been measured in CFS. Given this problem, the objective  of this project is to identify a panel of distinct antibody epitopes that can be used to identify  cases of CFS using a blood test. In Aim 1, we will apply serum epitope repertoire analysis to  determine the antibody epitope repertoires within a cohort of 200 CFS patients and 175  controls. Antibody epitopes occurring in CFS sera, and not controls will be identified   using bioinformatics methods. A panel of motifs will be downselected using machine  learning to optimize sensitivity and specificity within the discovery set. The performance of  the panel will be measured in an independent set of specimens to determine sensitivity and  specificity, and identify potential CFS subgroups. We will determine whether individual  markers, or sets of markers, correlate with various clinical features of CFS. Infections with a variety of pathogens have been associated with the development of fatigue lasting  one year or longer, and post-infection fatigue patients typically meet clinical criteria for CFS.  Given the potential for heterogeneous infectious etiology, we hypothesize that CFS patients may  exhibit increased rates of seropositivity for a broad set of infectious agents associated with  fatigue. Using serum epitope repertoire analysis, we will determine whether IgG seropositivity for  20 infections (as a group) differs between CFS patients and controls. The proposed project may  identify antibody biomarkers suitable for development of diagnostic immunoassay for CFS, and may  elucidate whether prior or ongoing infections are associated with CFS. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as myalgic encephalitis (ME), is a disabling condition  affecting an estimated 2.5 million people in the United States. The cause of CFS  remains unknown, and there are no objective laboratory diagnostic tests to  confirm disease. Consequently, diagnosis of CFS remains exceptionally difficult, requiring the  exclusion of a wide variety fatiguing illnesses. This project aims to apply advanced molecular  discovery tools and computation to identify patterns of circulating antibodies that can be   used to diagnose and monitor CFS patients using a blood test. This project also holds the  potential to associate prior infections with the development of CFS.",Serum antibody biomarkers of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome,9778480,R43AI145696,"['Academy', 'Adrenergic Agents', 'Affect', 'American', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Arthralgia', 'Autoantibodies', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Tests', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Caregivers', 'Cell physiology', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cholinergic Receptors', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Cost of Illness', 'Coxiella', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Encephalitis', 'Epitopes', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Exertion', 'Exhibits', 'Facilities and Administrative Costs', 'Fatigue', 'Feeling', 'Fever Chills', 'Gene Expression', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Immune', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Mononucleosis', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaise', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Muscarinics', 'Myalgia', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Nuclear Antigens', 'Organism', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Proteins', 'Psyche structure', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Seroprevalences', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Societies', 'Sore Throat', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'United States', 'acute infection', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker discovery', 'candidate marker', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'flu', 'immune activation', 'interest', 'lymph nodes', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic virus', 'seropositive', 'sleep abnormalities', 'tool', 'trend']",NIAID,"SERIMMUNE, INC.",R43,2019,224975,0,-0.01825280571367829
"The CRIT-ICU Biomarker Panel for Stratification of Mortality Risk in ARDS Patients PROJECT SUMMARY: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a devastatingly intense lung inflammatory disorder that annually afflicts more than 1 million individuals world-wide (200,000 cases/year in the U.S.) with an unacceptable mortality rate of 30-40%. Substantial clinical and biological heterogeneity within ARDS phenotypes has greatly impeded therapeutic developments to reduce mortality. All therapies currently employed in ARDS management are ge- neric. The critical care community suffers from a lack of tools that allow identification of ARDS sub-phenotypes and individuals most likely to benefit from novel therapies. Recently, the hyperinflammatory and low inflammatory ARDS sub-phenotypes were identified that markedly differ in natural histories, clinical and biological character- istics, biomarker profiles, responses to positive end-expiratory pressure, ventilator- and organ failure-free days and mortality. ARDS severity (PaO2/FiO2 ratio), the severity of renal or hepatic failure, or the extent of leukocy- tosis failed to distinguish the two phenotypes. As the mortality of the hyperinflammatory phenotype is 3-5 times greater than low inflammatory phenotype, this Phase I STTR will leverage substantial complementary expertise to: i) establish a novel panel of ARDS biomarkers (CRIT-ICU Panel) that stratifies subjects at risk for ARDS into high and low mortality sub-phenotypes; and ii) develop a quantitative platform to allow assessment of these validated biomarkers upon patient entry into the ER or ICU. Our preliminary biomarker data are strong and include 11 ARDS-relevant plasma biomarkers in >250 well-phenotyped ARDS subjects and 70 controls. The targeted biomarkers include cytokine-chemokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1b, IL-RA), dual-functioning cytozymes i.e. cy- tokine/intracellular enzymes (macrophage migration inhibitory factor, NAMPT), vascular injury markers (VEGF- A, S1PR3, angiopoietin 2), and the advanced glycosylation end product pathway (HMGB1, soluble RAGE). Spe- cific Aim #1 will apply standard biostatistical approaches as well as novel neural network artificial intelligence analysis of this existing dataset to identify an optimal plasma-derived CRIT-ICU Panel which predicts ICU mor- tality in patients with sepsis or trauma who are at risk for development of respiratory failure and ARDS. Specific Aim #2 will develop an optimized and highly standardized Predictive Platform for the CRIT-ICU biomarkers iden- tified to be used in the clinical care setting. Finally, Specific Aim #3 will conduct retrospective validation studies of the optimized CRIT-ICU Panel in biobanked samples from 2 large cohorts: an emergency room-ARDS cohort (PETAL Clinical Network, n=800) and a Spanish sepsis-ARDS cohort (n=200). We speculate that unique exper- tise within Aqualung Therapeutics Corp., PAI Life Sciences Inc., InBios International Inc. and the University of Arizona Health Sciences will drive future prospective validation of the CRIT-ICU Panel in patients at risk for ARDS (Phase II STTR) and lead to development of a true Point of Care test to accelerate clinical trial stratification strategies, and development of innovative ARDS therapeutics to reduce mortality in this devastating syndrome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a devastatingly intense lung inflammatory disorder that afflicts more than 1 million individuals world-wide each year (200,000 cases/year in the U.S.) with an unacceptable mortality rate of 30-40%. The tremendous heterogeneity of ARDS has greatly impeded therapeutic developments to address ARDS mortality and all therapies currently employed in ARDS management are generic. The critical care community suffers from a lack of empirical data and tools that would allow identification of ARDS sub- phenotypes and potentially identify individuals most likely to benefit from novel therapies. This Phase I STTR leverages substantial complementary expertise to establish a novel panel of ARDS biomarkers (CRIT-ICU Panel) that will be used to stratify subjects at risk for ARDS into high and low mortality sub-phenotypes and develop a predictive platform to allow assessment of these validated biomarkers upon entry into the ER or ICU.

"A Study to Validate and Improve an Automated Image Analysis Algorithm to Detect Tuberculosis in Sputum Smear Slides Abstract/Summary In this SBIR, we propose to validate our handcrafted image analysis algorithm for auto-detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in a digitized sputum smear. Once validated in a blinded study against manual microscopy and culture (the gold standard), we will try to improve our handcrafted algorithm by integrating, where appropriate, deep-learning approaches (via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)). Our novel diagnostic device (the Diascopic iON platform) uses automated image analysis to detect pathogens of interest. Through a blinded study (400 slides), we will assess the iON's effectiveness in detecting MTB. Our aim is to achieve >99% accuracy vs. microscopy, and sensitivity-specificity vs. culture of 80% and 99%, respectively. Currently, the iON platform can detect MTB on a Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stained sputum smear in less than 60 seconds, with accuracy of 95% vs. microscopy. The primary objective of this SBIR is to meet or exceed the minimal requirements for the WHO Target Product Profile (published 2014) of a rapid sputum-based test for detecting TB at the microscopy-center level of the health-care system. We will accomplish this feasibility study through a collaborative effort with the Case Western Reserve University-Uganda (UCRC) research team. A full-slide digitization and automated image analysis of 400 ZN slides is planned while on the ground in Uganda. Results will be published in an appropriate peer-reviewed journal for dissemination to the relevant TB pathology and provider community. A secondary objective of this SBIR is to improve our handcrafted algorithm through the use of deep- learning techniques (CNN). We will collaborate with Dr. Madabhushi (Case Western Reserve) - a world leader in Deep Learning methodologies – on this portion of the study. We are optimistic that by combining our handcrafted approach with a deep-learning approach, we can identify MTB bacilli more effectively (i.e. faster and more accurately). We will leverage the lessons-learned in this study to develop algorithms for other developing-world diseases like Onchocerca (river blindness), Plasmodium (malaria), and Shistomes (schistosomaisis). Successful completion of this SBIR will show that the iON can truly become a platform for automated pathogen detection, which will shift lab practices toward faster & more standardized routines that are performed by unskilled workers. If we're successful in this Phase I SBIR, we will develop auto-detect algorithms for 3-4 other pathogens in a phase II SBIR. We will then market the iON platform to resource-limited clinics in countries adversely affected by developing-world diseases. It is our experience that such clinics are seeking a rapid, low cost, accurate and simple diagnostic tool to improve their efficiency and their ability to detect and treat diseases. Narrative This SBIR is a validation study of a digital pathology platform to detect TB in digitized Ziehl–Neelsen (ZN) slides. We aim to establish a high accuracy (>99%) vs. manual microscopy and a sensitivity & specificity of 80% and 99%, respectively, vs. culture. The TB analysis occurs rapidly, with results available in <60 seconds. We will investigate whether algorithm improvements are possible by combining our handcrafted approach with deep-learning approaches to improve accuracy and efficiency. If high accuracy and sensitivity-specificity can be achieved for TB detection, this low-cost technology can have a significant impact on TB laboratory operations around the world. The technology can also be applied to other pathogens whose primary method of detection is microscopy.",A Study to Validate and Improve an Automated Image Analysis Algorithm to Detect Tuberculosis in Sputum Smear Slides,9851233,R43EB028736,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Bacillus (bacterium)', 'Blinded', 'Case Study', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Country', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Ions', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Low income', 'Malaria', 'Manuals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Ocular Onchocerciasis', 'Onchocerca', 'Pathogen detection', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plasmodium', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Slide', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Sputum', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tuberculosis', 'Uganda', 'Universities', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'digital pathology', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'man', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'operation', 'pathogen', 'portability', 'prevent', 'remote location', 'tool', 'tuberculosis diagnostics', 'validation studies']",NIBIB,"DIASCOPIC, LLC",R43,2019,225000,0,-0.022425600656926042
"Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is notoriously difficult to diagnose non-invasively, and current methods of assessing CMD utilize only the peak velocity of the coronary flow pattern. While new imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved the assessment coronary perfusion, there are currently no non-invasive methods that incorporate the coronary flow pattern over a complete cardiac cycle to definitively assess and predict the development of CMD.  Coronary blood flow (CBF) reflects the summation of flow in the coronary microcirculation, and our lab has begun to harness the full CBF pattern under varying flow and disease conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes) to determine whether it might harbor novel clues leading to the early detection of CMD. Our past and preliminary data indicate an early onset of CMD in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that occurs prior to the onset of macrovascular complications and that are characterized by blood flow impairments and alterations in coronary resistance microvessel (CRM) structure, function, and biomechanics. Our data also uncovered innovative correlations between CRM structure/biomechanics and our newly-defined features of the coronary flow pattern, some of which were unique to normal or diabetic mice. We have initially utilized these CBF features, in the presence and absence of other factors such as cardiac function, to develop a mathematical model in collaboration with Drs. Christopher Bartlett and William Ray that to date demonstrated that 6 simple factors can predict a normal vs. diabetic coronary flow pattern with 85% predictive accuracy. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the leading cause of heart disease and is associated with hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMD) is comprised of structural and functional deficits of the tiny coronary arteries that may be an earlier indicator of disease prior to the onset of overt CAD. The proposed multidisciplinary research aims to develop a computational artificial intelligence model that will accurately predict CMD based on a non-invasive coronary flow pattern obtained by Doppler echocardiography.",Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease,9769734,R21EB026518,"['Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic mouse', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doppler Echocardiography', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elements', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperemia', 'Hypertension', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Publications', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'coronary perfusion', 'db/db mouse', 'diabetic', 'disorder prevention', 'early onset', 'experimental study', 'heart function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'macrovascular disease', 'mathematical model', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent']",NIBIB,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R21,2019,228000,43994644,-0.007884959844605605
"Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema Approximately 25% of the millions of veterans (est. 8.92 million FY 2013) enrolled for care in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have diabetes mellitus, and diabetic macular edema (DME) is the leading cause of vision loss in the adult diabetic population world-wide. Although diabetic retinopathy has been well-studied, comparatively little is known about the burden of DME. In fact, only two national prevalence studies and no national study on the incidence of DME in persons with type 2 diabetes have been conducted. Similarly many risk factors have been characterized for DR, but no large studies have established predictors for DME.  Beyond the Medicare claims database, the VHA National Patient Care Database (NPCD) contains standardized administrative data for several aspects of patient care including diagnoses, procedures, medications, lab test results, vital signs, clinical text notes, and mortality. Because the VA uses teleretinal screening as routine clinical care for all patients with diabetes with these results included in the NPCD, the NPCD is an ideal source for studying the epidemiology of and risk factors for DME.  This study proposes to determine the burden of diabetic macular edema, establish risk factors, and examine treatment outcomes in a previously extracted dataset on 1.98 million veterans who have undergone diabetic retinopathy screening at least once since 2004. Currently invaluable ophthalmic data are encoded in unstructured clinical encounter notes in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), and no validated automated extraction method exists to capture these data elements. An automated extraction method using natural language processing will be created and validated to unlock key ophthalmic variables. These text extraction methods will be applicable to extracting ophthalmology data from not only notes of patients with DME but also any ophthalmology clinical note. This will enable future large scale studies in ophthalmology using NPCD and be immediately valuable to the research community at large.  The candidate, Dr. Aaron Lee, MD MSCI, is an ophthalmologist with subspecialty training in retina surgery with a strong background in computer science and epidemiology. His career goal is to become an independent clinician scientist studying diabetic eye disease with large-scale electronic medical record extracted data. While he possesses the foundational skills, he seeks to gain training in advanced statistics and natural language processing to unlock the data captured in unstructured clinical encounter notes. He has assembled an outstanding mentorship team under the primary mentor, Dr. Edward Boyko, MD MPH. This mentorship team includes renowned experts in clinical epidemiology, health informatics, ophthalmology, and natural language processing. This K23 will provide Dr. Lee the structured coursework, mentorship, and applied learning needed to acquire new research skills. He will leverage key local resources to carry out the proposed research at the University of Washington and the VA Seattle Epidemiologic Research and Information Center. Despite the significant visual loss associated with diabetic macular edema, little is known about the frequency of its occurrence, its risk factors, and the real-world effectiveness of existing treatments. The purpose of this proposed research is to utilize the VA National Patient Care Database to extract relevant data elements to examine these three clinical questions: 1) what is the incidence and prevalence of diabetic macular edema, 2) what are the risk factors associated with its development, and 3) what is the comparative real-world effectiveness of its treatments, including intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, intravitreal corticosteroid therapy and macular laser. The methods developed in this research proposal will not only further our understanding of DME but also generalize and enable future large-scale ophthalmic studies.",Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema,9756410,K23EY029246,"['Adopted', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anemia', 'Blindness', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cataract Extraction', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Foundational Skills', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Handedness', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Information Centers', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Light Coagulation', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medicare claim', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevalence Study', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Smoking Status', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Validation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Veterans', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Washington', 'bevacizumab', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'diabetes management', 'diabetic', 'epidemiology study', 'hands-on learning', 'health administration', 'intravitreal injection', 'kidney dysfunction', 'laser photocoagulation', 'macula', 'macular edema', 'mortality', 'proliferative diabetic retinopathy', 'screening', 'skills', 'statistics', 'therapy outcome', 'traditional therapy', 'treatment optimization']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K23,2019,233078,533302350,-0.001900702298995173
"Developing Database and Software infrastructure for Quantitative Radiologic Analysis of Lumbar Radiculopathy Project Summary/Abstract Diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy (LR) currently relies on a qualitative interpretation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies and lacks standardization. This has led to inconsistent treatment and rising costs, while quality of life metrics have remained stagnant. To standardize the diagnosis of LR, the subjective and qualitative radiologic assessment needs to be augmented with accurate measurements of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas, two anatomical structures that are critical to the etiology of LR. However, precise measurements will require manual delineations of these regions on MRI. This is a tedious and time-consuming process that is not feasible on a daily, large-scale basis in the clinic. Deep Learning (DL) is a relatively new machine learning technique, which holds the promise of automating NF and CC segmentation. None the less, there remain several challenges to making DL-based segmentation routine in clinical practice. First, training and validating a DL model for segmentation of a given anatomical structure requires a large amount of expert annotated training data. Expert annotated data is expensive and time consuming to obtain, thus thwarting the development of quantitative imaging diagnostics for LR. To address this, we propose an expert-led manual delineation of NF and CC using de-identified MRI data extracted from UCLA's picture archiving and communications system (PACS). We expect the resulting database to contain data from over 35,000 lumbar MRI scans, with associated clinical history, demographics, and patient outcomes data. In a subset (1000) of these data, NFs and CCs will be annotated by multiple human expert raters. The consensus of these delineations will be used as ground truth segmentations to train, validate and improve our understanding of DL models. Secondly, as a part of this proposal, we aim to address several technical challenges that limit the deployment of automated image segmentation techniques to the clinic. Chief amongst these challenges is the failure of automated methodologies in the face of variation due to factors such as pathology, scanner protocol alterations, and general demographic variation. Additionally, our current understanding of DL does not allow us to categorically state the total number of expert annotated data that will be needed to train a model with a specified level of accuracy. Finally, we do not currently understand how selection of training cases for expert delineation affects generalization accuracy. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose experiments to define the relationship between DL algorithms and the cardinality of training data. We will also explore the use of unsupervised machine learning strategies, namely clustering and reinforcement learning, to understand how training data selection influences algorithmic accuracy. In summary, we propose to address data availability and technical knowledge gaps to the development of accurate DL-based techniques for automated NF and CC delineation, with a broader view to standardize the diagnosis and treatment of LR. Project Narrative Basing radiological diagnoses on a quantitative characterization of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas would greatly improve the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar radiculopathy (LR). Manual measurement of this anatomy on every clinical study is not feasible; however, deep learning- (DL) based automated methods can reliable perform this task if 1) expert annotations to train DL algorithms are available and 2) we can train DL models to work accurately despite image heterogeneity. We address these knowledge gaps by developing 1) a database containing spine MR images with expert annotation of NFs and CCs and 2) intelligent training data selection frameworks to train DL algorithms and assess their robustness to heterogeneity.",Developing Database and Software infrastructure for Quantitative Radiologic Analysis of Lumbar Radiculopathy,9746373,R21EB026665,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Categories', 'Central cord canal structure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Investigative Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural History', 'Needs Assessment', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Radiculopathy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Diseases', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical database', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'experimental study', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'network architecture', 'neural network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'relational database', 'theories', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment optimization', 'unsupervised learning']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2019,234000,673201228,0.003412140831660434
"Development of a tracheal sound sensor for early detection of hypoventilation due to opioid overdose. Abstract More than 64,000 Americans died from drug overdose in 2016 and drug overdose is now the most common cause of death for people under 50 years old in the United States. Furthermore, the number of overdose deaths is increasing with the rise of abuse of powerful synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl. In May of 2017 National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) directors Drs. Collins and Volkow outlined how research may help reduce the death toll associated with the current opioid epidemic; one of the current critical needs is the development of new overdose-reversal interventions, including wearable technologies that can detect an (impending) overdose from physiological signals to signal for help, or trigger a coupled automated injection of naloxone. Automated detection of overdose is essential because most opioid overdoses occur when individuals are alone and unobserved by family members or first responders. Opioids cause respiration to slow and become irregular due to mu-opioid receptor mediated suppression of respiratory related regions of the brainstem and spinal cord. Importantly, there are characteristic early changes in breathing pattern that indicate a progression towards significant hypoventilation, but there is currently no easy-to –use method or device to measure these patterns non-invasively. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in respiratory monitoring using tracheal sounds. Tracheal sounds originate from the vibrations of the tracheal wall and surrounding soft tissues caused by gas pressure fluctuations in the trachea. These sounds can be collected from a microphone placed over the trachea and analyzed to determine the real-time respiratory rate and an estimate of respiratory flow and tidal volume. We hypothesize that individual trends in tracheal sounds detected by a machine- learning algorithm will provide an early warning sign of the onset of hypoventilation as a result of opioid overdose in humans. The aims of this proposal are to develop a machine learning algorithm that detects impending hypoventilation due to an opioid overdose and to develop an initial design for a miniature wireless tracheal sound sensor. Project Narrative RTM Vital Signs, LLC is developing a non-invasive Tracheal Sound Sensor for early detection of impending hypoventilation due to an opioid overdose. The sensor will continuously monitor an individual’s respiratory pattern to detect a significant change from baseline, in which case it will contact a caregiver and/or emergency personnel detailing the location and status of the person experiencing an opioid overdose or initiate a coupled naloxone injection. This technology has the potential to prevent a significant number of deaths as a result of opioid overdose by allowing for the timely detection of hypoventilation and administration of naloxone.",Development of a tracheal sound sensor for early detection of hypoventilation due to opioid overdose.,9680488,R41DA047779,"['Abdomen', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Body Patterning', 'Brain Stem', 'Breathing', 'Caliber', 'Caregivers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emergency Medical Technicians', 'Engineering', 'Environmental air flow', 'Family member', 'Fentanyl', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Hypercapnic respiratory failure', 'Hypoxemia', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Naloxone', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Noise', 'Opioid', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Sedation procedure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Snoring', 'Sorbus', 'Spinal Cord', 'Study Subject', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Thick', 'Tidal Volume', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Trachea', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'airway obstruction', 'alertness', 'base', 'body position', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'design', 'emergency service responder', 'engineering design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'first responder', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microphone', 'mu opioid receptors', 'notch protein', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'overdose death', 'phase 2 study', 'prediction algorithm', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'smartphone Application', 'soft tissue', 'sound', 'synthetic opioid', 'time use', 'trend', 'vibration', 'volunteer', 'wearable technology']",NIDA,"RTM VITAL SIGNS, LLC",R41,2019,236381,0,-0.023794736932628124
"Improving Critical Congenital Heart Disease Screening and Detection of ""Secondary"" Targets PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  We propose to develop an automated critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) screening algorithm using machine learning techniques to combine non-invasive measurements of perfusion and oxygenation. Oxygen saturation (SpO2)-based screening is the current standard for CCHD screening, however it fails to detect up to 50% of asymptomatic newborns with CCHD or nearly 900 newborns in the United States annually. The majority of newborns missed by SpO2 screening have defects with aortic obstruction, such as coarctation of the aorta (CoA), that do not result in deoxygenated blood entering circulation. Non-invasive measurements of perfusion such as perfusion index (PIx) and pulse oximetry waveform analysis is expected to improve the detection of newborns with defects such as CoA, which is currently the most commonly missed CCHD by SpO2 screening. Both PIx and pulse oximetry waveforms can be measured non-invasively and with the same equipment used for SpO2 screening.  Members of our team recently showed that the addition of PIx, a non-invasive measurement of pulsatile blood flow, has the potential to improve CCHD detection otherwise missed by SpO2 screening. However, variability of PIx over brief time periods (seconds) and human error in its interpretation limit its clinical capabilities. Additionally, human error in interpretation of the current SpO2 screening algorithm leads to missed diagnoses and inappropriate testing in healthy newborns. Therefore, an automated SpO2-PIx screening algorithm is needed to both simplify the screening process, and improve detection of defects that are missed with SpO2 screening. In order to achieve that, we will identify the optimal PIx waveforms to create a metric that discriminates between newborns with and without CCHD. We will perform pulse oximetry waveform analysis to identify other non-invasive components with discriminatory capacity for newborns with CCHD. Additionally, we will apply supervised machine learning techniques to automate the algorithm interpretation.  The proposed research is significant because an automated SpO2-PIx screening algorithm could save the lives of hundreds of newborns with CCHD that are not diagnosed by SpO2 screening. Additionally, this is innovative as it will be the first automatic interpretation of PIx measurement among newborns with CCHD and merging of automated PIx and SpO2, which will allow for easy implementation at later steps. Through collaboration with four pediatric cardiac centers, we will establish the infrastructure and necessary multidisciplinary relationships to conduct future multicenter studies to evaluate this novel combined SpO2-PIx algorithm on a large scale involving thousands of newborns. Improving the detection of CCHD will require a multidisciplinary approach among all the individuals involved in the care and screening of newborns with CCHD. Additionally, collaboration with engineering and computer sciences will be necessary to automate the SpO2-PIx CCHD screening algorithm. PROJECT NARRATIVE A screening approach that improves earlier detection of critical congenital heart defects with systemic obstruction is critically necessary. This application seeks to develop a screening algorithm that will combine the current screening standard, oxygen saturation, with non-invasive measurements of perfusion. This high risk, high reward approach is fundamentally different from other approaches as it will use machine learning techniques, and is expected to improve the detection of critical congenital heart defects with systemic obstruction and automate the interpretation of the screening results.","Improving Critical Congenital Heart Disease Screening and Detection of ""Secondary"" Targets",9805011,R21HD099239,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Aortic coarctation', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Critical Congenital Heart Defects', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Lesion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neonatal Screening', 'New York', 'Newborn Infant', 'Obstruction', 'Oxygen', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pulsatile Flow', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Research', 'Savings', 'Screening Result', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Upper Extremity', 'Validation', 'aortic arch', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'congenital heart disorder', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'human error', 'improved', 'indexing', 'infant death', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal period', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'screening', 'supervised learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2019,240804,254622553,-0.0375205305653772
"Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This “Pathway to Independence” award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position. Ultimately, she aims to become a faculty member in a radiology or bioengineering institute, where she can further research technical biomedical imaging and machine learning developments applied to the musculoskeletal system.

"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018 Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network 2018 Renewal ABSTRACT In the past 5 years, the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) has increased cumulative enrollment to over 2000 adult and pediatric patients in the ongoing Prospective and Retrospective registry studies. In addition, an “Acute” DILI protocol with collection of serial early biological samples for mechanistic biomarker studies was developed and implemented. Other network aims included investigation of the role of genetic polymorphisms in DILI susceptibility and outcome, development of improved causality assessment methods, and expansion of the LiverTox website. The University of Michigan team led by Dr. Fontana has played an important role in the design, implementation, and analysis of the primary and ancillary DILIN studies since its inception in 2003. Michigan has not only been a leading enroller in all of the ongoing Registry studies but also provided important leadership in multiple DILIN committees and initiatives. The Michigan team now proposes a series of novel and feasible study aims for the DILIN renewal. The PRIMARY AIM of this proposal is to continue to recruit and enroll high causality adult and pediatric DILI cases into the registry studies for genetic, immunologic, biomarker and mechanistic studies. The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Network has specific plans to increase the enrollment of ethnic minorities via the engagement of hepatologists/ collaborators in southeastern Michigan and elsewhere that care for a large number of African American, Hispanic, and Asian patients. In addition, further development of natural language processing algorithms to search the EMR at the University of Michigan are proposed to facilitate enrollment. Qualitative, quantitative and toxicological studies of the chemical constituents in the herbal and dietary supplement (HDS) products implicated in a growing proportion of DILI cases will be expanded via an ongoing collaboration with the National Center for National Products Research. The SECOND AIM of this proposal is to conduct pilot/ feasibility clinical trials to improve the outcomes of patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI. Proposed study designs include a 12 week course of a simple and safe, orally administered anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidant agent (e.g. budesonide, SAMe, vitamin E) in selected patients with severe acute DILI at risk for adverse outcomes. In addition, 12 to 24 week studies of a safe and effective orally administered anti- cholestatic agent such as an ileal apical bile salt transport inhibitor that may reduce serum bile acids are proposed for subjects at risk of chronic DILI. Lastly, prospective studies of magnetic resonance elastography and MRCP imaging are proposed to improve our understanding of the severity and natural history of DILI. The THIRD AIM of this proposal is to further expand the LiverTox website to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, develop and implement a computerized causality assessment instrument, and assemble working committees to insure that the website content remains up to date and pertinent. Finally, additional collaborations between DILIN and the US FDA and other regulatory agencies are proposed to enhance the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN for new causes of DILI and temporal changes over time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The University of Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the etiologies, risk factors, and outcomes of DILI via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients including targeted enrollment of ethnic minority patients that will help determine if there are racial differences in DILI susceptibility and outcomes via analysis of collected biological samples, DNA, liver tissue, and clinical data. Pilot/ feasibility clinical trials of simple, safe and mechanistically based treatments for patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI are also proposed.

"Anatomic biomarkers of chronic kidney disease progression among children Progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in childhood is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic bone disease, and death. Congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), including posterior urethral valves, account for 50-60% of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children and are the most common cause of ESRD in this age group. In children with CAKUT, kidney injury is often already established at birth due to renal dysplasia. Some children, however, maintain preserved kidney function into adulthood while others progress to ESRD in childhood. Our ability to effectively implement therapies to slow CKD progression is limited by our lack of understanding of which patients are at greatest risk for CKD progression and therefore would be most likely to benefit from early intervention. Thus there is a need for biomarkers that can identify children with CAKUT early in life who are at high risk of future CKD progression. To identify children with CAKUT early in life who are at high risk of future CKD progression, we will develop novel computational methods to derive clinically informative biomarkers from ultrasound (US) imaging data using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and effectively integrate them with established clinical measures for early prediction of CKD progression. To achieve reliable and accurate kidney segmentation, Aim 1 develops an automatic kidney segmentation method by adopting fully CNNs, conditional random fields, and active contour models to simultaneously learn informative high-level image features and inter-voxel relationship under shape regularizations to improve the segmentation accuracy and robustness to imaging noise. To achieve improved prediction of CDK progression based on US imaging data, deep CNNs will be adopted to learn informative imaging features in a multi-instance learning framework to predict which children with CAKUT will develop CKD progression and their timing of progression in Aim 2. These techniques will be applied to a dataset of patients followed at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, in order to derive individualized predictive indices of CKD progression. The proposed new techniques will allow us to early differentiate patients with distinct disease progression patterns. Fully automatic kidney ultrasound image segmentation and quantification methods will be developed using deep convolutional neural networks for early predicting chronic kidney disease progression",Anatomic biomarkers of chronic kidney disease progression among children,9669438,R21DK117297,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age-Months', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Bladder', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease Progression', 'Dysplasia', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Elasticity', 'End stage renal failure', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Goals', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Metabolic Bone Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Proteinuria', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urethra', 'Urinary tract', 'Urodynamics', 'age group', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'boys', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'high risk', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'kidney preservation', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized predictions', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'secondary analysis']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2019,262171,593605914,-0.01432582737246586
"Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival  Chronic kidney disease affects about 10% of adults in the United States and 7-12% of the population worldwide. It may lead to irreversible loss of kidney function, known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD). For patients with ESRD, kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment compared to dialysis in terms of patient survival, quality of life and cost. Despite the advantages of kidney transplants, most patients with ESRD are treated with dialysis primarily because there exist an insufficient number of compatible donors for patients. The human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) of the organ donor and recipient are known to be a significant contributing factor to transplanted organ survival times due to immunogenicity, the immune response of the recipient to the transplanted organ. Mismatches between donor and recipient HLAs are associated with shorter survival times; however, it is extremely rare to identify donors that have a perfect match with recipients, so most transplants involve mismatched HLAs. Our main objective is to accurately predict survival times for kidney transplants by incorporating both data- driven models of HLA compatibility based on outcomes of past transplants and biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity. Accurate prediction of survival times can improve patient transplant outcomes by enabling more efficient allocation of donors and recipients, particularly by reducing the number of repeat transplants due to graft failure with a poorly matched donor. We propose to estimate HLA compatibilities using high-dimensional variable selection techniques applied to outcomes of past transplants and through a novel donor-recipient latent space model for the HLA compatibility network. We then propose to incorporate these predicted compatibilities along with biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity using amino acid sequences and epitopes into a multi-task classification-based survival prediction algorithm. Our proposed approach for learning integrated data- and biologically-driven models of transplant survival generalizes broadly to organ transplantation (liver, heart, pancreas, lungs) and possibly to bone marrow transplantation. Finding better methods for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching between donor and recipient may redefine and improve clinical outcomes for organ and tissue transplants. In fact, new approach may revolutionize the selection of donors with recipients, thereby producing significantly improved long-term organ and tissue transplant survivals.",Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival ,9916110,R01LM013311,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens', 'Anus', 'Biological', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Donor Selection', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epitopes', 'HLA Antigens', 'Heart', 'Immune response', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organ Donor', 'Organ Survival', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Science', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Transplanted tissue', 'United States', 'base', 'cost', 'discrete time', 'graft failure', 'hazard', 'high dimensionality', 'human model', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'learning network', 'multitask', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'survival prediction', 'transplant model']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO,R01,2019,274577,3094550,0.0002798683860076713
"UC Davis Alzheimer's Core Center PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT As reflected in recent budget increases in the National Institutes of Health, and in line with the National Alzheimer’s Project Act, there is a need to enhance and leverage resources to decrease dementia disparities and change the trajectory of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. To fill this gap, we seek to enhance the University of California Davis Alzheimer’s Disease Center (UCD ADC), which contains a diverse ethnoracial cohort (having Hispanic, Black, and non-Hispanic White decedents), through implementation of digital pathology within our Neuropathology Core. This implementation will allow for rapid transmission of pathological data for consultation and collaborations, distribution of materials for educational purposes, tissue specimen archiving, and image analysis. In addition, by having a digital pathology with immunofluorescent capabilities will allow for viewing of the distribution (including overlap) of multiple proteins at one time within a tissue specimen. This can enhance biological studies by providing spatial relationships of proteins resulting in a deeper phenotype of disease. This supplement application is designed to support equipment and leverage and enhance infrastructure to allow the UCD ADC the ability to 1) purchase a whole slide image system to digitize existing and future histologically stained samples 2) leverage and enhance current servers and database systems to allow for storage and rapid retrieval of digital images and their data and 3) leverage and enhance hardware to develop and deploy pipelines for quantitative computational methodologies for pathologies found within a diverse ethnoracial cohort of Alzheimer’s disease brains. The UCD ADC continues to excel and expand in its research initiatives to collect and provide brain specimens and pathological data on a diverse population of individuals at various stages of cognitive ability and dementia risk. This supplement will further enable suitable infrastructure for enhancement of current collaborations and facilitate emerging collaborations by providing a means to share and analysis pathology on digitized whole slide images. PROJECT NARRATIVE Digital microscopy paired with machine learning algorithms has aided in diagnosis and provide more quantitative pathology data to unlock the secrets of diseases. These technologies are needed within the dementia field, specifically in diverse cohorts, as disease presentations may differ. By implementing state of the art imaging systems and analysis, the goals of this supplement are to enhance the ADC’s ability to provide greater access to high quality pathological data for educational, consultation and collaborative purposes, infrastructure to pursue digital solutions for more quantitative analysis, and safe secure storage of histologic specimens.",UC Davis Alzheimer's Core Center,9852188,P30AG010129,"['Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Archives', 'Autopsy', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Budgets', 'California', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Database Management Systems', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Educational Materials', 'Equipment', 'Extramural Activities', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Glass', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Infusion procedures', 'Knowledge', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Senile Plaques', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Systems Analysis', 'Technology', 'Thioflavin S', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'beta pleated sheet', 'cognitive ability', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'disease phenotype', 'histological specimens', 'histological stains', 'human tissue', 'imaging system', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuropathology', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'spatial relationship', 'synergism', 'transmission process', 'whole slide imaging']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,P30,2019,289154,254622553,-0.04928236511026854

"Real-Time Virtual Assessment of MitraClip Placement ABSTRACT Mitral regurgitation (MR) is the most common type of valvular heart disease in patients over the age of 75 years in the US. Despite the prevalence of MR in the elderly population, however, almost half of patients identified with moderate- severe MR are turned down for traditional open-heart surgery due to co-morbidities. MitraClip (MC) is a recent percutaneous approach to treat MR by placement of MC in the center of the mitral valve (MV) to reduce MR. Despite the positive short-term outcomes of the MC procedure in reducing MR, the long-term outcome can be further improved if the effects of MC on both the fluid and solid mechanics of the MV and left ventricle (LV) were available at the time the clip is placed. Recently, we developed a physics-based human cardiac function simulator for the optimal design of a novel annuloplasty ring with a sub-MV element for correction of MR, as well as physics-based simulations of MC placement. The problem with these simulations, as far as clinical applications is concerned, is they are extremely time consuming (3 days to complete simulations on 96-processor cluster). One way to make these time consuming simulations clinically applicable is to run them in advance for a wide range of patient characteristics (e.g., degree of MR, size and shape of the MV and LV, etc.) and MC placements. Currently, when clinicians are ready to place the MC on the MV, they have at their fingertips real-time data on degree of MR, and size and shape of the MV and LV measured using 3D transesophageal echocardiography (RT3D-TEE). We propose the development and validation of a searchable virtual patient atlas (SVPA) that will provide the clinician with detailed predictions of patient outcomes in real time that are based on MC placement and the RT3D-TEE patient-specific data. The first 50 models in our SVPA will be created from existing RT3D-TEE datasets provided by National Heart Centre Singapore, NHCS. Then, we will use our novel-shape dictionary learning models to automatically generate 150 additional models for our SVPA. Machine learning models will be trained with the simulation data in order to create machine learning-FE (ML-FE) surrogates that can predict FE outputs directly from the model geometry. This would enable real-time prediction of patient-specific MC device outcomes. Our preliminary studies using 3D heart simulations clearly show that the main advantage with the ML model over the 3D FE model is speed (i.e., ML runs in 1 CPU second versus 3D FE model runs in 1100 CPU hours!). We will validate the outcome predictions of our SVPA using an additional 50 existing RT3D-TEE datasets with known MC patient outcomes provided by NHCS. After the outcome prediction using SVPA for each case, we will use the dataset and the measured outcome to train the original SVPA further and validate a new dataset with the original and the updated SVPA. We will select the more accurate SVPA (the original or the updated) to determine possible correlations between the primary geometrical parameters and other patient overall biometric information with the MR and optimal MC placement. NARRATIVE A leaky inlet valve of the major pumping chamber of the heart is the most common valvular heart disease in elderly patients. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration approved a device that can be inserted into the patient’s heart using a catheter.

"SCH: A Computer Vision and Lens-Free Imaging System for Automatic Monitoring of Infections Automated monitoring and screening of various physiological signals is an indispensable tool in modern medicine. However, despite the  preponderance of long-term monitoring and screening modalities for certain vital signals, there are a significant number of applications for  which no automated monitoring or screening is available. For example, patients in need of urinary catheterization are at significant risk of  urinary tract infections, but long-term monitoring for a developing infection while a urinary catheter is in place typically requires a caregiver to  frequently collect urine samples which then must be transported to a laboratory facility to be tested for a developing infection. Disruptive  technologies at the intersection of lens-free imaging, fluidics, image processing, computer vision and machine learning offer a tremendous  opportunity to develop new devices that can be connected to a urinary catheter to automatically monitor urinary tract infections. However, novel  image reconstruction, object detection and classification, and deep learning algorithms are needed to deal with challenges such as low image  resolution, limited labeled data, and heterogeneity of the abnormalities to be detected in urine samples. This project brings together a multidisciplinary team of computer scientists, engineers and clinicians to design, develop and test a system that integrates lens-free imaging, fluidics, image processing, computer vision and machine learning to automatically monitor urinary tract infections. The system will take a urine sample as an input, image the sample with a lens-free microscope as it flows through a fluidic channel, reconstruct the images using advanced holographic reconstruction algorithms, and detect and classify abnormalities, e.g., white blood cells, using advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms. Specifically, this project will: (1) design fluidic and optical hardware to appropriately sample urine from patient lines, flow the sample through the lens-free imager, and capture holograms of the sample; (2) develop holographic image reconstruction algorithms based on deep network architectures constrained by the physics of light diffraction to produce high quality images of the specimen from the lens-free holograms; (3) develop deep learning algorithms requiring a minimal level of manual supervision to detect various abnormalities in the fluid sample that might be indicative of a developing infection (e.g., the presence of white bloods cells or bacteria); and (4) integrate the above hardware and software developments into a system to be validated on urine samples obtained from patient discards against standard urine monitoring and screening methods. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This project could lead to the development of a low-cost device for automated screening and monitoring of urinary tract infections (the most  common hospital and nursing home acquired infection), and such a device could eliminate the need for patients or caregivers to manually collect  urine samples and transport them to a laboratory facility for testing and enable automated long-term monitoring and screening for UTIs. Early  detection of developing UTIs could allow caregivers to preemptively remove the catheter before the UTI progressed to the point of requiring  antibiotic treatment, thus reducing overall antibiotic usage. The technology to be developed in this project could also be used for screening  abnormalities in other fluids, such as central spinal fluid, and the methods to detect and classify large numbers of cells in an image could lead to  advances in large scale multi-object detection and tracking for other computer vision applications. n/a",SCH: A Computer Vision and Lens-Free Imaging System for Automatic Monitoring of Infections,9976740,R01AG067396,"['Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacteriuria', 'Caregivers', 'Catheters', 'Cations', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Erythrocytes', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Image', 'Infection', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modality', 'Modern Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Nursing Homes', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Urinalysis', 'Urinary Catheterization', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'classification algorithm', 'cost', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'diffraction of light', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imager', 'imaging system', 'laboratory facility', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'particle', 'reconstruction', 'screening', 'software development', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,299197,807432003,-0.017310408461274202
"Automatic Thoracic Organ Segmentation Tool for Radiation Treatment Planning of Cancers in Thoracic Region ABSTRACT As early detection and better treatment have increased cancer patient survival rates, the importance of protecting normal organs during radiation treatment is drawing more attention. Cancers in the thoracic region, which include lung, esophageal, thymus, mesothelioma and breast cancers, are among the most pervasive and deadly cancers. The protection of normal thoracic organs including lungs, heart, esophagus and spinal cord is critical in reducing long term toxicity in such cancers. To avoid excessively high radiation doses to such organs-at-risk (OARs), they are required to be correctly segmented from simulation computed tomography (CT) scans during radiation treatment planning to get an accurate dosage distribution. Despite tremendous effort into the development of semi- or fully-automatic segmentation solutions, current automated segmentation software, mostly using the atlas-based methods, has not yet reached the level of accuracy and robustness required for clinical usage. Therefore, in current practice, significant manual efforts are still required in the OAR segmentation process. Manual contouring suffers from inter- and intra-observer variability as well as institutional variability where different sites adopt distinct contouring atlases and labeling criteria and thus leads to inaccuracy and variability in OAR segmentation. When OARs are very close to the treatment target, segmentation errors as small as a few millimeters can have a statistically significant impact on dosimetry distribution and outcome. In addition, it is also costly and time consuming as it can take 1-2 hours of a clinicians’ time to segment major thoracic organs due to the large number of axial slices required. The associated human efforts would significantly increase if adaptive radiation therapy (ART) is used as OARs from two or more simulation CT scans need to be segmented to adjust treatment plans. In recent years, the rapid development of deep learning methods has revolutionized many computer-vision areas and the adoption of deep learning in medical applications has shown great success. Based on a deep-learning-based algorithm we developed that achieved better-than-human performance and ranked 1st in 2017 American Association of Physicist in Medicine Thoracic Auto-segmentation Challenge, a thoracic OAR auto-segmentation product will be developed in this project with the two aims: 1) improve and validate the deep-learning-based automatic thoracic organ segmentation algorithm on a larger clinical data set, and 2) incorporate this algorithm into a preliminary product that fits into the clinical workflow. With this product, the segmentation accuracy can be improved, leading to more robust treatment plans in protecting normal organs and improved long term patient outcome. Furthermore, the time and cost of radiation treatment planning can be greatly reduced, contributing to a more affordable cancer treatment and reduced healthcare burden. NARRATIVE As early detection and better treatment have increased cancer patient survival rates, the importance of protecting normal organs during radiation treatment is drawing more attention. To avoid excessively high radiation doses to such organs-at-risk (OARs), they are required to be correctly segmented from simulation computed tomography (CT) scans.

"Data-Driven Shape Analysis for Quantitative Severity Stratification in Patients with Metopic Craniosynostosis Abstract Craniosynostosis affects close to one in 2000 newborns and causes growth restriction perpendicular to the affected suture. Metopic craniosynostosis is the second most common form of craniosynostosis. The metopic suture is an important sight of cranial growth as the brain rapidly expands in the ﬁrst year of life. Patients affected by metopic craniosynostosis will present in the ﬁrst few months of life with varying degrees of narrowing of the forehead and brow, a triangular shaped head, and an abnormal eye position. Surgery is recommended early in childhood to normalize the head shape and expand the restricted skull to prevent complications such as headaches, cognitive impairment, and visual disturbances including blindness.  Imaging with computed tomography (CT) is employed to conﬁrm new diagnoses of metopic craniosynostosis and, together with the physical exam, is used in a descriptive and qualitative manner to assess the degree of head shape abnormality. Several methods have been employed to interpret the information provided in the CT scans to allow surgeons to utilize data for surgical decision making. However, these indices reduce the complex three-dimensional skull dysmorphology into isolated measurements of angles or proportions, require detailed calculations to perform, and no universally accepted standard has emerged so far despite signiﬁcant research efforts and clinical motivation.  In this grant proposal, we aim to increase our understanding of the cranial dysmorphology in patients with metopic craniosynostosis by employing latest results from statistical shape modeling and deep learning. Specif- ically, we will build a statistical shape model of pediatric skulls from CT images of patients with metopic cran- iosynostosis as well as a group of normal controls capturing normal phenotypical shape variations. The distance of a new shape from the normative shape space will represent the proposed Shape Normality Metric (SNM). The SNM will be validated against ratings from experts in the surgical community (current standard of care) who will be asked to assess the dysmorphology of the skulls in our database. To avoid surgeons' subjective bias, we will aggregate their response using statistical methods that compensate for potential individual bias. Finally, to streamline data collection for future research we will develop a head-shape portal that will allow users to upload CT scans of their patients and the system will automatically calculate the SNM.  By developing a severity metric that encompasses the entire extent of dysmorphology in metopic craniosyn- ostosis and establishing a head-shape portal, we will improve our understanding of the spectrum of metopic craniosynostosis, aid in pre-operative and surgical decision making, enable future research, and help facilitate longitudinal outcomes assessments and multi-center communication and collaboration. Narrative This grant proposal aims to improve our understanding of the head shape anomaly associated with metopic craniosynostosis by using recent results from statistical shape analysis and deep learning, with the goal of developing an objective metopic cranioynostosis severity scale. Different from previously proposed metrics, our approach evaluates the entire shape as a whole. With this information, surgeons will be able to objectively determine how severely affected their patients are and will be better able to tailor their interventions to the needs of their individual patients. Additionally, surgeons will be able to better communicate with each other and study the effects of surgical intervention on their patients which will improve patient care in the long run.",Data-Driven Shape Analysis for Quantitative Severity Stratification in Patients with Metopic Craniosynostosis,9778826,R21EB026061,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Applications Grants', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Cephalic', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Deformity', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye Abnormalities', 'Forehead', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Headache', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Joint structure of suture of skull', 'Left', 'Letters', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Newborn Infant', 'Normalcy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Socialization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereophotogrammetries', 'Stratification', 'Supervision', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Trauma patient', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image processing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'neural network', 'operation', 'patient stratification', 'power analysis', 'premature', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'self esteem', 'shape analysis', 'standard of care', 'surgery outcome', 'web-based tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2019,307172,228951281,0.0036892028935350605
"Associating retinal nerve fiber layer thickness with glucose metabolism and diabetic retinopathy Project Summary/Abstract Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a metabolic disease that affects over 300 million people worldwide and that can be accompanied by serious health complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, stroke, and damage to the eyes, in particular diabetic retinopathy (DR), which is diagnosed in a third of people with diabetes and which is the leading cause of blindness within the age group between 20 and 64 years. T2DM is clinically diagnosed by parameters related to glucose metabolism obtained by blood tests. Due to its long pre- symptomatic phase, an estimate of 25% of diabetics in the US are undiagnosed. In this project, the relationship between spatial patterns of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness (RNFLT), measured by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), and blood test levels as well as levels of DR severity is investigated in 9,261 participants of a population based study.  In a first step, OCT RNFLT measurements of the macular and the circumpapillary area around optic nerve head are segmented into spatial sectors, and representative spatial patterns of RNFLT are calculated by an unsupervised machine learning method. Afterwards, a multivariate linear model comparison is performed with the coefficients of the spatial RNFLT patterns as regressors and diagnostic blood test results as dependent variable. The optimal combination of the RNFLT patterns, determined by an established model selection criterion (Bayes Factor), is expected to reveal insight into the association between the specific retinal locations of RNFL thinning accompanying the change in parameters related glucose metabolism during the development and progression of T2DM. Furthermore, fundus images are graded by DR severity following a nine-step scale derived from the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study from no DR to severe proliferative DR. The spatial RNFLT patterns and metabolic blood test scores are then compared with respect to modeling DR severity by linear regression. An optimal model of DR severity combining glucose metabolism parameters and RNFLT patterns is developed. Finally, in an analogous procedure, DR severity of the follow-up measurement, five years after baseline, is statistically predicted from RNFLT and metabolic blood parameters and from their change over time.  To summarize, the proposed research identifies spatial patterns of RNFLT associated with parameters of glucose metabolism and their development over DR severity. Once accomplished, the proposed project would provide the details to establish RNFLT as an alternative manifestation of T2DM that complements diagnostic blood tests and thereby, for instance, lay the foundations for the development of novel and more accurate T2DM progression monitoring or the prediction of the onset of DR. Project Narrative Parameters related to glucose metabolism obtained by blood tests are clinically used to diagnose diabetes, a metabolic disease that affects over 300 million people worldwide and that can be accompanied by serious health complications, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), the leading cause of blindness within the age group between 20 and 64 years. Decreased levels of blood glucose tolerance have been associated with retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning, but these results were based on comparisons between small populations of diagnosed diabetics and healthy controls, and RNFL was typically represented by coarse summary parameters which neglect retinal anatomy. This project contributes directly and immediately to public health by exploring the relationship between spatial patterns of RNFL thickness, present and future DR severity, and diagnostic blood test results in 9,261 participants of a population based study, with the final goal to establish and quantify RNFL thickness as an alternative manifestation of diabetes that complements diagnostic blood tests and lays the foundations for the development of novel and more accurate disease progression monitoring or the prediction of DR onset.",Associating retinal nerve fiber layer thickness with glucose metabolism and diabetic retinopathy,9809589,R21EY030631,"['Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Blindness', 'Blood', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Tests', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early treatment', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'OGTT', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Scanning', 'Selection Criteria', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Stroke', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Validation', 'age group', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'diabetic', 'fasting plasma glucose', 'follow-up', 'fundus imaging', 'glucose metabolism', 'glucose tolerance', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'macula', 'neglect', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'proliferative diabetic retinopathy', 'public health relevance', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'unsupervised learning']",NEI,SCHEPENS EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2019,313837,12024944,0.0067603567115366945
"Common Fund Data Supplement: Integration of KOMP2 (IMPC) and PHAROS into MARRVEL 2.0 for machine learning-assisted rare variant prioritization Project Summary  This application is being submitted in response to NOT-RM-19-009 as a supplement to the parent award U54NS093793.  The Common Fund supports a number of resources that can significantly enhance gene and variant prioritization for study in the Model Organisms Screening Center of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network and beyond. To facilitate the use of these resources, we propose to create a tool that can be easily accessed by clinical geneticists and model organism scientists alike.  MARRVEL (Model organism Aggregated Resources for Rare Variant ExpLoration) was created two years ago because important data that is necessary for rare variant analysis for personalized medicine is spread throughout the internet in tens of different locations. To improve efficiency and streamline access to these data sources, we created a web-tool that allows users to query tens of data sources at once, including GTEx, and links to IMPC, the display portal for KOMP2.  In this proposal, our goal is to develop version 2 of MARRVEL to promote the use of Common Fund resources in the rare disease research community for manual and automated data analysis. This goal will be accomplished by developing MARRVEL 2.0 by integrating KOMP2 (IMPC) and PHAROS data and using the aggregated dataset to develop a machine-assisted gene and variant prioritization for diagnosis and animal model generation.  Our goals align with those of the NIH Common Fund to increase the utility of resources for broader use in the biomedical community.

"Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rationale. Diabetes is a leading cause of renal disease, accounting for 40% of the estimated 20 million US adult cases of chronic kidney disease. There is, however, substantial heterogeneity across diabetic patients with regards to development of kidney disease. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic biomarkers that can provide early and reliable evidence of future kidney disease, so that high-risk patients can receive optimal medical care. Existing clinical, proteomic and genomic markers do not consistently nor accurately predict kidney function decline. Metabolomics, a systematic evaluation of the end-products of cellular function in fluids, has the potential to inform physiological and pathological effects of chronic diseases. Metabolomic analysis combined with advanced quantitative methods could play a key role in building clinically useful prognostic signatures of diabetic kidney disease. Yet, development of computational methods with adequate rigor has lagged behind the technical capacity to perform large scale quantitative metabolomics. In this proposal we aim to address this computational gap in diabetic kidney disease research. Aims. We will implement rigorous computational methods to identify robust prognostic metabolite + clinical + genetic signatures of diabetic kidney disease progression. Specifically, we aim to (i) test the accuracy of previous signatures, and apply state-of-the-art analytic techniques and novel statistical methods to identify new multivariate metabolite sets for predicting kidney disease progression; (ii) quantify patterns of co-regulation of metabolites in diabetic kidney disease, and develop new tools in network biology to discover novel enzymes, proteins, metabolites, and molecular pathways which are implicated in diabetic kidney disease progression; (iii) test if these models can accurately predict kidney disease progression in independent prospective cohorts. Methods. Using clinical, genetic and metabolomic data from large prospective cohorts of > 1200 diverse, well- characterized patients with Type 2 diabetes, we will apply statistical methods for variable selection (e.g., penalized regression), and machine learning methods (e.g., random forest), which are known to perform well in the high-dimensional setting, to identify robust and parsimonious signatures of kidney disease progression. We will quantify inter-metabolite co-regulation patterns and infer biological pathways implicated in diabetic kidney disease. Throughout the modeling process, a rigorous training-validation paradigm will be adopted in order to improve reproducibility of models and reduce chance findings. Impact. A major product of this work will be the development of a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline. Our findings will also provide insight into markers of renal dysfunction, and elucidate possible therapeutic targets for treating diabetic kidney disease, thus potentially informing the design of future clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney disease, a major and common complication of diabetes, can lead to repeated hospitalizations and premature death. There is an urgent need to develop clinical tools that can provide early evidence that a given diabetic patient is likely to progress to kidney disease in the future. In this proposal, we will identify new urinary biomarkers and use novel statistical modeling methods to create a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline, with the ultimate goal of improving disease management and reducing mortality rates for these patients.",Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease,9695208,R01DK110541,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pima Indian', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Type 2 diabetic', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'bioinformatics tool', 'biological heterogeneity', 'chemical association', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'genetic signature', 'genomic biomarker', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'kidney dysfunction', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'model development', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'nephrogenesis', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'predictive test', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'random forest', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,335803,524978793,0.011233691514759796
"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning. Success of the project will overcome the major technical hurdles in the use of MRI in radiation therapy and will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. It will pve the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process.",MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning,9624738,R01CA193730,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Head and neck structure', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predisposition', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Protons', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiation therapy', 'Site', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'anatomic imaging', 'attenuation', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'density', 'electron density', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'primary endpoint', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'radiation delivery', 'reconstruction', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,343572,560644462,-0.014992029870412609
"Automated data curation to ensure model credibility in the Vascular Model Repository Three-dimensional anatomic modeling and simulation (3D M&S) in cardiovascular (CV) disease have become a crucial component of treatment planning, medical device design, diagnosis, and FDA approval. Comprehensive, curated 3-D M&S databases are critical to enable grand challenges, and to advance model reduction, shape analysis, and deep learning for clinical application. However, large-scale open data curation involving 3-D M&S present unique challenges; simulations are data intensive, physics-based models are increasingly complex and highly resolved, heterogeneous solvers and data formats are employed by the community, and simulations require significant high-performance computing resources. Manually curating a large open-data repository, while ensuring the contents are verified and credible, is therefore intractable. We aim to overcome these challenges by developing broadly applicable automated curation data science to ensure model credibility and accuracy in 3-D M&S, leveraging our team’s expertise in CV simulation, uncertainty quantification, imaging science, and our existing open data and open source projects. Our team has extensive experience developing and curating open data and software resources. In 2013, we launched the Vascular Model Repository (VMR), providing 120 publicly-available datasets, including medical image data, anatomic vascular models, and blood flow simulation results, spanning numerous vascular anatomies and diseases. The VMR is compatible with SimVascular, the only fully open source platform providing state-of-the-art image-based blood flow modeling and analysis capability to the CV simulation community. We propose that novel curation science will enable the VMR to rapidly intake new data while automatically assessing model credibility, creating a unique resource to foster rigor and reproducibility in the CV disease community with broad application in 3D M&S. To accomplish these goals, we propose three specific aims: 1) Develop and validate automated curation methods to assess credibility of anatomic patient-specific models built from medical image data, 2) Develop and validate automated curation methods to assess credibility of 3D blood flow simulation results, 3) Disseminate the data curation suite and expanded VMR. The proposed research is significant and innovative because it will 1) enable rapid expansion of the repository by limiting curator intervention during data intake, leveraging compatibility with SimVascular, 2) increase model credibility in the CV simulation community, 3) apply novel supervised and unsupervised approaches to evaluate anatomic model fidelity, 4) leverage reduced order models for rapid assessment of complex 3D data. This project assembles a unique team of experts in cardiovascular simulation, the developers of SimVascular and creator of the VMR, a professional software engineer, and radiology technologists. We will build upon our successful track record of launching and supporting open source and open data resources to ensure success. Data curation science for 3D M&S will have direct and broad impacts in other physiologic systems and to ultimately impact clinical care in cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular anatomic models and blood flow simulations are increasingly used for personalized surgical planning, medical device design, and the FDA approval process. We propose to develop automated data curation science to rapidly assess credibility of anatomic models and 3D simulation data, which present unique challenges for large-scale data curation.

"High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs ABSTRACT In this application we will perform high throughput, high content, screening for small molecules that improve kidney regeneration after acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI presents a dire unmet medical need because of its high prevalence with long-term adverse health effects and life-threatening sequelae. Mortality is high and the only effective treatments are renal replacement therapies. The onset of the precipitating event is unpredictable, and in many instances once patients are admitted to the hospital, injury has already occurred. Improving recovery from injury therefore presents an attractive opportunity for intervention, but to date, no therapies are available that are effective if administered post injury. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate and follows a well-defined cellular mechanism that encompasses dedifferentiation of surviving renal tubule cells, proliferation of resulting progenitors, and repopulation of the denuded tubule. This sequence of events, together with their respective molecular markers, is conserved between humans, mouse, and zebrafish. During regeneration, transcription factors normally expressed during organogenesis (e.g.,lhx1a, pax2, and pax8) are reactivated. We previously demonstrated that small molecule-mediated augmentation of endogenous Lhx1a expression can ameliorate recovery in zebrafish and mouse models of AKI. Together these data support the overall hypothesis that augmentation by small molecules of cellular programs that drive kidney repair after injury represents a novel pharmacologic approach for the treatment of AKI and associated sequelae. Using a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses Lhx1a-EGFP we have developed an artificial intelligence-based, high-content assay to quantify lhx1a expression in the living embryo. Using multivariate analysis, the assay met accepted HTS assay performance standards and was validated in three-day variability studies and a small pilot library screen. We will perform a primary HTS of 50,000 compounds from the MLPCN collection. Prioritized hits will be subjected to a fully implemented, rigorous secondary assay paradigm encompassing kidney organ development, metabolic stability, in vivo efficacy, and activity profiling in a pathophysiological relevant AKI model. At the end of these studies we will have identified functionally and mechanistically characterized in vivo chemical probes to investigate the biology of kidney injury and regeneration, some of which are expected to have features that make them suitable for development into preclinical leads. NARRATIVE Acute kidney injury (AKI) presents a dire unmet medical need with unacceptably high mortality rates and a lack of therapeutic modalities. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate that can be enhanced by small molecules. In this proposal we will perform high-content, high throughput screening for kidney regeneration in zebrafish to discover novel chemical probes to investigate mechanisms of augmented kidney regeneration after injury.",High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs,9613245,R01DK112652,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Breeding', 'Carboxylic Acids', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Fibrosis', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Liver', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Microsomes', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Bank', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Organogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Prodrugs', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Renal tubule structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tubular formation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Zebrafish', 'analog', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'kidney repair', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'organ growth', 'organ regeneration', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,352125,570146095,-0.013147130928079842
"A Novel Informatics System for Craniosynostosis Surgery Project Summary CranioSynOstosis (CSO) is the premature fusion of one or more of cranial sutures that connect individual skull bones for kids. The estimated prevalence of CSO is one in 2500 live births and even higher. Our ultimate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS). CSO is an extremely serious birth defect that involves the premature fusion, of one or more sutures on a baby's skull. CSO, in terms of the fused suture, could be classified mainly into several types of synostosis, such as sagittal, coronal, metopic, and lambdoid. Infants with CSO may have problems with brain and skull growth, resulting in cognitive impairment. This defect may not only ruin the infant's life, but also deeply affect the infant's family. SAS, recognized as a safe, effective, and less invasive treatment method, introduced to treat the CSO. This treatment uses the force of a spring to reshape the skull in a slower manner that harnesses the growth of the skull to assist with shape change. Patient-specific spring selection is the principal barrier to the advancement of SAS for CSO because few surgeons have the experience to select personalized springs for each patient. The selection of the spring force is a crucial step in this surgical treatment, and it is dependent on the experience of the surgeon. Important factors essential in the selection of the spring force include the ages, bone thickness and the subtypes of CSO. One example is that sagittal CSO with an elongated occiput needs a stronger posterior spring, while one with no predominant characteristics typically needs a mid-range anterior and posterior spring. The current problem is that we do not have a complete objective way of classification of CSO and sagittal CSO and estimation of the spring force for the individual. Our hypothesis is that CSO and sagittal CSO can be accurately classified based on the features from sutures and head shape, and behaviors of calvarial bone tissue following virtual optimal spring force can be accurately simulated by integrating a finite element method (FEM) with statistical learning model. To test our hypothesis, we are proposing the following Specific Aim: (1) To define the eSuture Informatic system and build the database, with CT and DTI data; (2) To develop tools for image processing, segmentation, registration, quantification of sutures, and automatically categorize each patient to one catalogue of the CSO types or sagittal CSO subtype; (3) To model and estimate the optimal spring force for SAS; and (4) To validate and evaluate the eSuture system.

"Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT Keratoconus is a degenerative disease of the cornea that is a major cause of reduced vision-related quality of life in the United States, often leading to corneal transplantation. Ectasia after refractive surgery is a vision-threatening complication that can occur in apparently low-risk patients despite current screening technology. The biomechanical properties of the cornea play a central role in these diseases, but diagnostics are still rooted in shape measures because doctors lack direct measures of biomechanical change. While several methods have shown early promise for addressing this gap, most require contact with or perturbation of the cornea, cannot spatially resolve biomechanical properties, or involve expensive optical systems.  To address the need for direct biomechanical measurement of the cornea and the limitations of other approaches, we introduce phase-decorrelation OCT (phd-OCT). Phd-OCT makes use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to quantify random nanoscale mobility that is related to the strength and cohesion of the cornea. Preliminary results strongly support the rationale, feasibility and potential advantages of the approach. Our objectives are: (1) to refine our method to optimize detection sensitivity and speed, and (2) to determine if the technique is clinically useful. We will achieve these objectives through the following aims: 1. To develop and validate mobility-sensitive phd-OCT for corneal imaging. Spectral-domain OCT will be used for anterior segment phase-decorrelation imaging and the analysis algorithm will be optimized. The system will be validated using phantoms and torsional rheometry. 2. To investigate the potential influence of physiological factors (intraocular pressure (IOP), hydration, and temperature). Factorial design experiments in porcine and human donor globes will establish the sensitivity of phd-OCT measurements to potential confounders. 3. To develop and validate data acquisition and processing methods to enable clinical testing. GPU processing and machine learning will be configured to minimize processing time. Scan patterns will be optimized to minimize scan time and return clinically useful data. 4. To assess feasibility and preliminary diagnostic performance of clinical mobility-sensitive OCT imaging of the cornea. A first-in-human study will characterize repeatability and test the hypotheses that phd-OCT mobility measurements are increased in the region of a LASIK flap and decreased in CXL.  Expected Outcomes: The proposed studies will establish a new, non-contact method for imaging corneal biomechanical properties with the potential to address many shortcomings of current and emerging methods. Success could lead to earlier detection of of ectasia risk and allow more appropriate timing and customization of corneal treatments. Future integration of data into computational models has the potential to greatly impact the field by driving a shift from empirical planning and risk analysis to patient-specific strategies. The mechanical properties of the cornea, the transparent front of the eye, are important for diseases that affect vision as well as for corrective treatments like crosslinking therapy and LASIK. We have developed a new optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based method to detect and map corneal mechanical properties that has advantages that may make it readily translatable to clinical use. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether this technique is clinically feasible and useful by refining the technology, testing it in animal and human donor corneas, and performing studies in patients with corneal conditions of interest.",Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT,9735326,R01EY028667,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cornea', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Laser In Situ Keratomileusis', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'computerized data processing', 'crosslink', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'mechanical properties', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NEI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,396887,197030888,-0.003001954813098228
"Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT With the introduction of many novel techniques to minimize radiation dose in CT, there is still a large variation in terms of radiation dose levels prescribed in CT exams and therefore a large variation of diagnostic performance. Some patients may receive higher dose than necessary. Some may be under-dosed and mis- diagnosed as a result of insufficient image quality. In order to determine the appropriate amount of radiation dose reduction in each exam, accurate quantification of diagnostic performance is needed so that the dose reduction can be achieved without sacrificing important diagnostic information. However, currently there is a lack of efficient and quantitative tools for objective assessment of diagnostic performance, particularly for many of the novel dose reduction methods involving non-linear processing of the data such as iterative reconstruction and deep-learning-based noise reduction methods. The specific goal of this application is to disseminate a highly automated solution, CT Protocol optimization (CTPro) software, to a wide CT community. This quantitative tool provides an efficient implementation of diagnostic performance assessment and CT radiation dose optimization. This tool is based on channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), which itself was developed decades ago to mimic human observer visual responses in signal detection tasks. However, the use of CHO in clinical CT is quite limited because of a lack of rigorous validation and efficient and robust implementation in practice. We were the first to demonstrate its correlation with human observer performance in low-contrast detection, classification and localization tasks in clinical CT. The main objective of the current proposal is to optimize this tool for simplicity and robustness, and disseminate it to CT researchers and clinical users, which will be accomplished through 3 specific aims: Aim 1: Optimize CTPro for simplicity, robustness, and generalizability. Aim 2: Develop an open-source web-based platform for software dissemination. Aim 3: Build use cases and disseminate CTPro. The proposed work is significant because the software tool will allow any CT users and researchers to perform CT radiation dose optimization and diagnostic performance evaluation in an efficient, quantitative, and objective manner. This work is innovative in that the automated tool will use quantitative measures of diagnostic performance to systematically guide the complex task of CT dose optimization, moving beyond traditional metrics that are inappropriate for many novel dose reduction techniques. The software tool, once widely employed, will facilitate a paradigm shift in how dose optimization and the evaluation of dose reduction techniques are performed, and will allow a more rapid and consistent adoption of dose reduction technology into clinical practice, which will benefit millions of CT patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a lack of quantitative tools for efficient and objective assessment of diagnostic performance in CT, which is the reason why inappropriate radiation dose is frequently used in CT exams, resulting in unnecessarily high radiation exposure to patients or lose of important diagnostic information. The purpose of this project is to disseminate a highly automated solution to a wide CT community for efficient CT radiation dose optimization. If successful, appropriate amount of radiation can be prescribed for millions of CT patients at any facility, while maintaining the level of diagnostic information required for high quality patient care.",Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment,9881453,U24EB028936,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Encapsulated', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Newsletter', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computerized data processing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'open source', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'symposium', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'web site']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U24,2019,397500,276703803,-0.010879874153219022
"Distributed Learning of Deep Learning Models for Cancer Research Project Summary Deep learning methods are showing great promise for advancing cancer research and could potentially improve clinical decision making in cancers such as primary brain glioma, where deep learning models have recently shown promising results in predicting isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation and survival in these patients. A major challenge thwarting this research, however, is the requirement for large quantities of labeled image data to train deep learning models. Efforts to create large public centralized collections of image data are hindered by barriers to data sharing, costs of image de-identification, patient privacy concerns, and control over how data are used. Current deep learning models that are being built using data from one or a few institutions are limited by potential overfitting and poor generalizability. Instead of centralizing or sharing patient images, we aim to distribute the training of deep learning models across institutions with computations performed on their local image data. Although our preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, there are three key challenges to translating these methods into research practice: (1) data is heterogeneous among institutions in the amount and quality of data that could impair the distributed computations, (2) there are data security and privacy concerns, and (3) there are no software packages that implement distributed deep learning with medical images. We tackle these challenges by (1) optimizing and expanding our current methods of distributed deep learning to tackle challenges of data variability and data privacy/security, (2) creating a freely available software system for building deep learning models on multi- institutional data using distributed computation, and (3) evaluating our system to tackle deep learning problems in example use cases of classification and clinical prediction in primary brain cancer. Our approach is innovative in developing distributed deep learning methods that will address variations in data among different institutions, that protect patient privacy during distributed computations, and that enable sites to discover pertinent datasets and participate in creating deep learning models. Our work will be significant and impactful by overcoming critical hurdles that researchers face in tapping into multi-institutional patient data to create deep learning models on large collections of image data that are more representative of disease than data acquired from a single institution, while avoiding the hurdles to inter-institutional sharing of patient data. Ultimately, our methods will enable researchers to collaboratively develop more generalizable deep learning applications to advance cancer care by unlocking access to and leveraging huge amounts of multi-institutional image data. Although our clinical use case in developing this technology is primary brain cancer, our methods will generalize to all cancers, as well as to other types of data besides images for use in creating deep learning models, and will ultimately lead to robust deep learning applications that are expected to improve clinical care and outcomes in many types of cancer. Project Narrative We develop technology that will enable researchers to tap into the enormous amount of imaging data in multiple institutions to create deep learning models for cancer applications without requiring sharing of patient data. Our work will thus enable development of more robust deep learning models to improve clinical decision making in cancer than models currently built on data from single institutions. Although our focus is improving decision making in the primary brain cancer, our methods and tools are generalizable and will be broadly applicable to all cancers, with the potential for improvement in clinical care and patient health.",Distributed Learning of Deep Learning Models for Cancer Research,9827476,U01CA242879,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Brain', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Glioma', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Information Networks', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Privacy', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer type', 'care outcomes', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'learning strategy', 'molecular marker', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient privacy', 'radiologist', 'research to practice', 'software systems', 'survival prediction', 'tool']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,401628,560644462,-0.021071173758924616
"Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction Project Summary We propose a novel way of reconstructing medical images rooted in deep learning and computer vision that models the process how human radiologists are using years of experience from reading thousands of cases to recognize anatomical structures, pathologies and image artifacts. Our approach is based on the novel idea of a variational network, which embeds a generalized compressed sensing concept within a deep learning framework. We propose to learn a complete reconstruction procedure, including filter kernels and penalty functions to separate between true image content and artifacts, all parameters that normally have to be tuned manually as well as the associated numerical algorithm described by this variational network. The training step is decoupled from the time critical image reconstruction step, which can then be performed in near-real-time without interruption of clinical workflow. Our preliminary patient data from accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions suggest that our learning approach outperforms the state-of-the-art of currently existing image reconstruction methods and is robust with respect to the variations that arise in a daily clinical imaging situation. In our first aim, we will test the hypothesis that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition. In the second aim, we will answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications. Finally, we will perform a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee. We will compare our proposed approach to a clinical standard reconstruction. Our hypothesis is that our approach will lead to the same clinical diagnosis and patient management decisions when using a 5min exam. The immediate benefit of the project is to bring accelerated imaging to an application with wide public-health impact, thereby improving clinical outcomes and reducing health-care costs. Additionally, the insights gained from the developments in this project will answer the currently most important open questions in the emerging field of machine learning for medical image reconstruction. Finally, given the recent increase of activities in this field, there is a significant demand for a publicly available data repository for raw k-space data that can be used for training and validation. Since all data that will be acquired in this project will be made available to the research community, this project will be a first step to meet this demand. Project Narrative The overarching goal of the proposal is to develop a novel machine learning-based image reconstruction approach and validate it for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The approach is able to learn the characteristic appearance of clinical imaging datasets, as well as suppression of artifacts that arise during data acquisition. We will test the hypotheses that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition, answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications, and validate our approach in a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee.",Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction,9783816,R01EB024532,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Step training', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'patient population', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,438449,329565273,0.0023510628614580196
"Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy There are 65 million people worldwide with epilepsy and 150,000 new cases of epilepsy are diagnosed in the US annually. However, treatment options for epilepsy remain inadequate, with many patients suffering from treatment-resistant seizures, cognitive comorbidities and the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to progress towards the development of new therapies is the fact that preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). Recently, the Datta lab showed that complex animal behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules (“syllables”) at sub-second timescales and arranged according to specific rules (“grammar”). These syllables can be detected without observer bias using a method called motion sequencing (MoSeq) that employs video imaging with a 3D camera combined with artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted video analysis to characterize behavior. Through collaboration between the Soltesz and Datta labs, exciting data were obtained that demonstrated that MoSeq can be adapted for epilepsy research to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in a mouse model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. Here we propose to test and improve MoSeq further to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in epilepsy research. This includes the development of an objective alternative to the Racine scale, testing of MoSeq as an automated anti-epileptic drug (AED) screening method, and the development of human observer- independent behavioral biomarkers for seizures, epileptogenesis, and cognitive comorbidities. In addition, we plan to dramatically extend the epilepsy-related capabilities of MoSeq to include the automated tracking of finer-scale body parts (e.g., forelimb and facial clonus) that are not possible with the current approach. Finally, we propose to develop the analysis pipeline for MoSeq into a form that is intuitive, inexpensive, user-friendly and thus easily sharable with the research community. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user- independent, inexpensive analysis of both acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will develop breakthrough technologies involving artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of mouse behavior to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in preclinical epilepsy research. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to have a significant and sustained impact on epilepsy research by enabling investigators to perform objective, automated, inexpensive, reproducible assessment of epilepsy in experimental animals to aid the testing of anti-seizure drugs and other novel therapies.",Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy,9862231,R01NS114020,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Body part', 'Cannabidiol', 'Carbamazepine', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clonazepam', 'Clonus', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Screening', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Face', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Observer Variation', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phenytoin', 'Pilocarpine', 'Probability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Specificity', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'Valproic Acid', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'behavior test', 'drug use screening', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kainate', 'method development', 'mouse model', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'selective expression', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,450365,560644462,-0.0019019593611460264
"Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD Abstract Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is exceptionally common, with an estimated one hundred million afflicted people in the United States. Detection and risk stratification of this very common disease remains a major challenge. Despite recent advances, including development of numerous therapeutic agents presently in phase 2 and 3 trials, NAFLD remains a silent disease in which the vast majority of patients accumulate progressive liver damage without signs or symptoms and, undiagnosed, receive no medical care. The NAFLD patients at highest risk of cirrhosis are those with moderate or greater liver fibrosis at the time of diagnosis, a group of patients who are described as having high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH). The current reference standard for identifying people with hrNASH is liver biopsy, which is expensive, invasive, and limited by interobserver variability. The focus of this project is to develop and validate low cost non-invasive diagnostic technology to diagnose hrNASH. We propose to accomplish this in three Specific Aims. First, we will expand and annotate an existing database of patients with chronic liver disease from 328 subjects to 1,000 subjects, ~40% of whom will have NAFLD. The database will contain ~20,000 images (~10,000 ultrasound elastography images and ~ 10,000 conventional ultrasound images) and multiple demographic and clinical data points for each subject (a total of ~30,000 clinical, laboratory, and demographic data points). We have previously developed advanced image processing techniques to make ultrasound elastography more accurate and less variable. We will use this large database to develop, customize and refine our image processing techniques for NAFLD evaluation (Aim 1), with the goal of improving ultrasound elastography diagnosis of hrNASH. Second, we will combine conventional ultrasound elastography imaging, conventional ultrasound imaging, our advanced image analysis techniques, and the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data in a machine learning model to predict hrNASH and will compare the performance of our predictive model with the FIB4, a widely-used blood test-based prediction rule (Aim 2). Third, we will validate our predictive model in an independent prospective cohort of NAFLD subjects undergoing biopsy for NAFLD risk stratification (Aim 3). We hypothesize that the combination of image processing-enhanced elastography and conventional ultrasound imagery combined with demographic, clinical, and laboratory data will have greater predictive power for hrNASH than clinical or sonographic data alone. The proposed predictive models have the potential to (1) reduce the number of liver biopsies performed for hrNASH detection, (2) facilitate recruitment for clinical trials of NAFLD therapeutics, and (3) improve care quality for the most common liver disease in the United States. Project Narrative In this project, we aim to create low-cost non-invasive technology to diagnose people with high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH), a common liver disease that has a high risk of cirrhosis. We will accomplish this goal by improving liver ultrasound imaging and by creating a prediction tool that integrates liver ultrasound, laboratory testing and clinical information. This prediction tool has the potential to reduce the need for liver biopsies.","Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD",9640524,R01DK119860,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Tests', 'Caring', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Laboratories', 'Liver', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase II/III Trial', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Prospective cohort', 'Quality of Care', 'ROC Curve', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'chronic liver disease', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'disorder subtype', 'elastography', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'liver injury', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,462750,551214295,0.0009077329271188289
"A Novel Imaging Analysis Platform for Patients with Craniomaxillofacial Deformities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our ultimate goal is to improve our ability to create and measure 3D models derived from cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Our main motivation is to improve quality and reduce costs in care of patients with craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities. The resulted innovations will also impact other fields. CMF deformities involve congenital and acquired deformities of the jaws and face. A large number of patients in the US and around the world suffered from CMF deformities. The evaluation of these patients includes an assessment of CMF form on 3D models that are traditionally generated from segmented spiral multi-slice CTs (MSCTs). These models are also used to plan their treatment. The purpose of segmentation is to separate different anatomical structures and to remove the artifacts on the CTs. Once 3D models are generated from the segmented CTs, anatomical and teeth landmarks are manually digitized for measurements. Finally, diagnosis and treatment planning are performed based on measurements. Although MSCT provides high- quality images and thus allows relatively fast and easy post processing, many concerns have been raised on excessive radiation exposure to patients. Therefore, more doctors are now using CBCT scanners in their offices. CBCT has less radiation and is inexpensive compared to the MSCT, but their use in generating 3D models is greatly limited by the poor image quality, i.e., low contrast / signal-to-noise ratio and artifacts. Thus, the existing automated segmentation algorithms developed for MSCT are incapable of practically segmenting CBCTs. The current solution to CBCT segmentation entails an arduous and lengthy process that involves labor-intensive manual editing of hundreds of slices. Besides, another arduous and inaccurate task in the assessment of CMF deformities is the digitization of anatomical landmarks on 3D models - the first step to quantify the deformities. Currently a typical 3D cephalometric and teeth analysis requires the manual digitization of more than 200 landmarks, which is time consuming and has limited accuracy. We hypothesize that the creation and measurement of high-quality 3D models can be significantly improved by developing innovative CBCT-friendly post processing tools. Therefore, in this renewal project, we propose to develop and validate a novel CBCT analysis platform to automate the process of CBCT segmentation and landmark digitization. The feasibility of our approaches has already been proven by our preliminary studies. Our innovative CBCT analysis platform will significantly improve the quality and reduce the cost of care to the individuals with CMF conditions. It will change our dental/CMF fields in effectively utilizing CBCT as a guide for on-the-fly diagnosis and treatment planning. With minimal user intervention, the computer will accurately and effectively do the work, which is currently artistically done by the labor-intensive human operators. The resulted innovations may also impact other fields in the future, e.g., orthopedic surgery and cardiovascular surgery where intraoperative whole-body CBCT is acquired for image-guided surgery and intervention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is widely used in physician's offices for orthodontics, craniomaxillofacial (CMF) surgery, facial plastic surgery and dentistry, but its segmentation and landmark digitization have to be completed artistically by human operators, which is labor-intensive and with limited accuracy.  We propose to develop and validate an innovative CBCT post processing system to automate the processes of CBCT segmentation and landmark digitization with minimal user intervention.  The proposed system will significantly improve the quality and reduce the cost of care to the individuals  with CMF conditions, and also change 1) the fields of orthodontics, CMF surgery and general dentistry in  effectively utilizing CBCT as a guide for diagnosis and treatment planning, and 2) the fields of orthopedic  surgery, general surgery, and cardiovascular surgery where the quality and the speed of intraoperative  imaging is critical.",A Novel Imaging Analysis Platform for Patients with Craniomaxillofacial Deformities,9624752,R01DE022676,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Back', 'Cardiovascular Surgical Procedures', 'Cephalometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consultations', 'Consumption', 'Deformity', 'Dental Care', 'Dentistry', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Jaw', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Orthodontics', 'Orthopedic Surgery procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians&apos', ' Offices', 'Plastic Surgical Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tomography, Computed, Scanners', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'care costs', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'cost', 'craniofacial', 'craniomaxillofacial', 'design', 'detector', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'open source', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'simulation', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIDCR,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,490358,27487788,0.0009202010414597102
"Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images Abstract Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness among US adults between the ages of 20 and 74 years. Laser photocoagulation surgery has been established as an effective way of treating retinopathy if it is detected early. Yearly retinal screening examinations are a potent tool in the battle to reduce the incidence of blindness from diabetic retinopathy because they provide diabetic patients with timely diagnoses and consequently, the potential for timely treatment. Primary care safety net clinics provide monitoring and other services for diabetic patients but they are often not equipped to provide specialty care services such as retinal screenings. Access to specialists who can provide retinal screenings can be increased through the use of telemedicine, which has shown great promise as a means of screening for diabetic retinopathy in the US and internationally. A pilot study by Charles Drew University investigators had a total of 2,876 teleretinal screenings performed for diabetic retinopathy, with 2,732 unique diabetic patients from six South Los Angeles safety net clinics screened. The present study aims to build on this prior work by: (a) developing novel software that utilizes information from clinical records to detect latent diabetic retinopathy in diabetic patients who have not yet received an annual eye examination, and (b) devising methods to speed up the diabetic retinopathy detection process for diabetic patients who have had digital retinal images taken by partially automating the process using image processing and machine learning techniques. Specifically, we propose to: 1. Develop predictive models for diabetic retinopathy using risk factors collected from patient clinical records. 2. Develop predictive models for automated diabetic retinopathy assessment using a combination of patient  risk factor data and data from digital retinal images previously evaluated by experts. 3. Evaluate the predictive accuracy of: a) the models developed for specific aim 2, and, b) the assessments of  optometrist readers against standard of care dilated retinal examinations by board certified  ophthalmologists for 300 diabetic patients utilizing a new Los Angeles County reading center. 4. Create web-based software tools based on the predictive models developed in specific aim 1 that can be  used to initiate outreach to high-risk patients in under-resourced settings, boosting detection rates for those  patients who are most at risk for diabetic retinopathy. 5. Establish targeted outreach methods to promote screening for patients that the predictive models from  specific aim 1 identify as potentially having undetected diabetic retinopathy. Narrative Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness among US adults between the ages of 20 and 74 years. Although previous studies within the US and internationally have shown that teleretinal screening can increase access to eye examinations for detecting retinopathy, few studies have focused on the US urban safety net, which has ophthalmic screening rates that are well below the US average and a preponderance of diabetic patients who are from ethnic minority groups. Building on a previous teleretinal screening study that assessed 2,732 South Los Angeles patients for retinopathy, this study deploys machine learning and image processing techniques to detect latent retinopathy in unscreened diabetic patients and partially automate the diabetic retinopathy detection process for teleretinal screening.",Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images,9751381,R01LM012309,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alaska Native', 'American Indians', 'Asian Americans', 'Blindness', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'County', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Eye', 'Glucose', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Insurance', 'Health care facility', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'International', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Optometrist', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Services', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Telemedicine', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'care systems', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'ethnic minority population', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'inner city', 'laser photocoagulation', 'medical specialties', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outreach', 'patient screening', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'racial minority', 'randomized trial', 'retinal imaging', 'safety net', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend']",NLM,CHARLES R.

"Integrative Predictors of Temporomandibular Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This application proposes the development of efficient web-based data management, mining, and analytics, to integrate and analyze clinical, biological, and high dimensional imaging data from TMJ OA patients. Based on our published results, we hypothesize that patterns of condylar bone structure, clinical symptoms, and biological mediators are unrecognized indicators of the severity of progression of TMJ OA. Efficiently capturing, curating, managing, integrating and analyzing this data in a manner that maximizes its value and accessibility is critical for the scientific advances and benefits that such comprehensive TMJ OA patient information may enable. High dimensional databases are increasingly difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional processing applications, creating a continuing demand for innovative approaches. Toward this end, the DCBIA at the Univ. of Michigan has partnered with the University of North Carolina, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Kitware Inc. Through high-dimensional quantitative characterization of individuals with TMJ OA, at molecular, clinical and imaging levels, we will identify phenotypes at risk for more severe prognosis, as well as targets for future therapies. The proposed web-based system, the Data Storage for Computation and Integration (DSCI), will remotely compute machine learning, image analysis, and advanced statistics from prospectively collected longitudinal data on patients with TMJ OA. Due to its ubiquitous design in the web, DSCI software installation will no longer be required. Our long-term goal is to create software and data repository for Osteoarthritis of the TMJ. Such repository requires maintaining the data in a distributed computational environment to allow contributions to the database from multi-clinical centers and to share trained models for TMJ classification. In years 4 and 5 of the proposed work, the dissemination and training of clinicians at the Schools of Dentistry at the University of North Carol, Univ. of Minnesota and Oregon Health Sciences will allow expansion of the proposed studies. In Aim 1, we will test state-of-the-art neural network structures to develop a combined software module that will include the most efficient and accurate neural network architecture and advanced statistics to mine imaging, clinical and biological TMJ OA markers identified at baseline. In Aim 2, we propose to develop novel data analytics tools, evaluating the performance of various machine learning and statistical predictive models, including customized- Gaussian Process Regression, extreme boosted trees, Multivariate Varying Coefficient Model, Lasso, Ridge and Elastic net, Random Forest, pdfCluster, decision tree, and support vector machine. Such automated solutions will leverage emerging computing technologies to determine risk indicators for OA progression in longitudinal cohorts of TMJ health and disease.

"MR Fingerprinting for Epilepsy Abstract Epilepsy affects 65 million people worldwide; approximately 30% of them do not respond to medications but can be cured by surgery. Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a major pathology for medically intractable epilepsies, is frequently missed by visual analysis of the conventional MRI, making surgical treatment very difficult. We propose to develop a novel quantitative MRI acquisition and analysis framework specific for epilepsy patients, which could provide more sensitive and specific measures of brain structure, thereby improving FCD detection and subtype prediction. To this end, the quantitative framework will be developed and validated in three steps: (1) Develop high-resolution Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) scan that allows simultaneous quantification of multiple tissue property maps efficiently, accurately and precisely. These quantitative maps have shown to be more sensitive and specific on detecting and characterizing subtle signal abnormalities. (2) Develop image post-processing methods to analyze quantitative maps, which will provide quantitative measurements that highlight additional morphological features, such as gray-white boundary blurring, abnormal cortical thickness and folding. (3) Develop machine-learning-based feature screening and prediction tools to characterize group-level features differentiating FCD subtypes, and predict individual-level FCD location and subtyping. Because detection and subtype prediction of FCD are both associated with seizure outcomes, epileptologists can use this tool to provide more personalized and customized counseling. The result of our proposed work promises a paradigm shift by converting the current standard-care of visual/qualitative MRI review to a quantitative framework, including data acquisition, post-processing and decision support tool, that would eventually lead to better treatment planning, reduction in unnecessary pre-surgical evaluation tests (especially invasive evaluation), and improved post-operative seizure outcomes in patients with devastating and disabling medically intractable epilepsy. The quantitative nature of our acquisition/analysis methods also makes it possible to be uniformly adopted by other centers with high consistency. Project Narrative Epilepsy affects 65 million people worldwide; approximately 30% of them do not respond to medications but can be cured by surgery.

"Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):1 Of all markers of human health, the most intuitive is body shape but based on quantitative evidence.  2 Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio  3 (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality  4 risk than body mass index (BMI). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can quantify regional adiposity in  5 more detail than the above measures but is underutilized for many reasons including potential harm from  6 ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments  7 in the ""quantified self movement"" to better describe phenotypes of body shape and its relation to metabolic  8 risks. The candidate developed in this proposal is 3D optical whole body scanning. If successful, sophisticated  9 obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with 10 disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment 11 technology. Whole body 3D imaging technology is already so accessible that it can be done with video games 12 such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect, and consumer cameras. 13 The long term goal of the Optical Body Shape and Health Assessment Study is 1) to provide phenotype 14 descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in 15 research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive 16 models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, 17 muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat), and then show how our 3DO body composition estimates are 18 associated to important metabolic risk factors. Our central hypothesis is that 3DO measures of body 19 composition with shape classification better predict metabolic risk factors than anthropometry or DXA body 20 composition alone. Our specific aims are: 1. Identify the unique associations of body shape to body 21 composition indices in a population that represents the variance of sex, age, BMI, and ethnicity found 22 in the US population; 2. Describe the precision and accuracy of 3DO scans to monitor change in body 23 composition and metabolic health interventions; and 3. Estimate the level of association of 3DO to 24 common health indicators including metabolic risk factors by gender, race, age, and BMI. In an 25 exploratory aim, we investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct 26 predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class 27 Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self- 28 assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US 29 population, and how these models relate to important metabolic status and body composition. The positive 30 impact will be the immediate applicability to clinicians and individuals for personalized risk assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of who is at high risk of metabolic diseases because of a poor metabolic profile. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults.

"An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis Project Summary  Improved methods for the bedside diagnosis and evaluation of neuromuscular disorders are needed. One technology that is finding increasing use for this purpose is electrical impedance myography (EIM). In EIM, a very weak, high frequency electrical current is passed through a muscle of interest and the resulting surface voltages are measured. Disease associated alterations in the composition and microstructural features of the muscle produce characteristic changes that can be used to help classify specific conditions and grade disease severity. To date, most studies using EIM analysis have utilized a fairly limited data set for disease assessment. While effective, this approach ignores a great deal of information locked within the impedance data, including those values that can assist in predicting specific muscle features (such as myofiber diameter) and the presence of pathological change (e.g., fat or connective tissue deposition). In addition, as it stands, the data set is challenging for the clinician to understand without a detailed knowledge of impedance theory. Myolex, Inc is a small business concern located in Boston, MA has as its main focus the development of EIM technologies for clinical use. Myolex recently completed a Phase 1 SBIR that demonstrated the potential capability of machine learning based classification algorithms to effectively discriminate healthy muscle from diseased and to discriminate one disease from another. In this proposed work, we will greatly advance this concept by embodying classification algorithms into a powerful new software suite for Myolex’s current EIM system, the mView. Our underlying hypothesis is that EIM data analysis can be automated to the point that classification systems can provide data on disease diagnosis as well as disease severity for improved ease-of-use. We propose to study this hypothesis via 2 specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will design a software suite capable of assisting with artifact-free data collection to be incorporated into our current EIM system, the mViewTM. Then using classification paradigms based on a prodigious amount of previous collected data, we will develop an automated data analysis tool to help provide data on disease category as well as microscopic features, muscle based on the impedance data alone using Microsoft’s Azure Cloud platform. In Specific Aim 2, we will test this developed software suite in a total of180 adult and pediatric neuromuscular disease patients and healthy participants evaluated at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (adults) and Boston Children’s Hospital (children). During this data collection period, the Ohio State and Boston Children’s researchers will have real- time access to Myolex staff to provide feedback and have questions/problems answered and addressed. The user interface will continue to be refined and classification algorithms improved. At the conclusion of this work, a new diagnostic tool will be developed for potential 510(k) FDA approval. It will serve as the basis for a continuously self-refining system as additional data sets are collected by end-users employing them in regular clinical use. Project Narrative  Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a valuable technique to assist with the evaluation of a variety of conditions affecting nerve and muscle. However, to date, only simplistic EIM outcomes have been utilized to assess muscle condition. In this proposed work, we will develop a software platform using machine learning to be incorporated into current EIM technology to allow for automated diseased classification and characterization using the entire large EIM data set collected with each muscle measurement. This will serve as the basis for a new, powerful and convenient tool for neuromuscular diagnosis that will continue to advance over time.",An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis,9846955,R44NS113756,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Area', 'Back Pain', 'Boston', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Connective Tissue', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Health', 'Inclusion Body Myositis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Technology', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Muscle', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Myography', 'Myopathy', 'Myositis', 'Nerve', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neuromuscular conditions', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Provider', 'Radiculopathy', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'classification algorithm', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'commercialization', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'electric impedance', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'method development', 'nerve injury', 'neuromuscular', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric patients', 'physical therapist', 'prototype', 'sarcopenia', 'software development', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'voltage']",NINDS,"MYOLEX, INC.",R44,2019,621318,869698,-0.00034767180131434265
"Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus Abstract Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most serious manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Current clinical laboratory markers lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to optimize individual patient care creating a need to develop novel biomarkers for LN. To address this unmet need there has been a significant effort within the lupus research community to identify novel LN biomarkers, but to date none have been qualified for clinical use. We speculate that one of the important causes of these failures is that no single biomarker can account for the heterogeneity of SLE or LN. Under the hypothesis that multiple categories of biomarkers can represent different aspects of risk for LN, we propose to assess biomarkers that are classified into categories of disease susceptibility, systemic inflammation, and kidney compartment/cell injury to build models for risk prediction. Our objective is to develop composite biomarkers for early detection of renal flares, chronic renal damage, and treatment response of LN patients. To accomplish this goal we will use biospecimens from longitudinal observational cohorts and clinical trials that have well-annotated patient samples. The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) team therefore proposes to partner with the Ohio State University (OSU) team to combine each group's longitudinal SLE cohorts and create a well-phenotyped patient resource suited to biomarker discovery and large enough to adequately power validation studies. The combined OSU-MUSC cohort will have approximately 500 LN patients who have had rheumatology/nephrology clinic visits and biospecimens collected every two to six months for up to ten years. Using these samples, our collective team has already described several DNA, serum and urine biomarkers that are associated with disease activity, treatment response or organ damage in LN, and has considerable experience in developing biomarker panels for outcomes in LN. We have reviewed the last decade's literature, systematically ranked novel biomarkers, and propose to test the top performing LN biomarkers in this proposal to address whether: (i) Biomarkers associated with active LN can be used to predict impending renal flares in prospective longitudinal cohorts; (ii) Baseline measures of composite panels of urine or serum biomarkers can distinguish between who will and who will not achieve a renal response to one year of conventional therapy with mycophenolate mofetil; (iii) The development of genetic risk profiles of LN patients to identify those who are predisposed to develop chronic kidney damage. We will also compare biomarkers predictive of disease outcomes in LN to those in non-renal SLE, working towards developing LN specific vs general biomarker panels that are indicative of active inflammation and/or damage accrual. Our ultimate goal is to have validated LN predictors of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be clinically relevant, and that can be easily assayed in most clinical service laboratories to improve patient care. Relevance to Public Health Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic debilitating autoimmune disease that can lead to serious kidney damage and death. Given the high incidence of end stage kidney disease in minority women afflicted with lupus nephritis, it is essential to develop surrogate biomarkers to be able to predict impending disease flares, treatment response, and renal damage. The development of validated biomarker panels will pave the way towards better clinical management of patients who have lupus nephritis.",Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus,9703894,R01AR071947,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Services', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine clearance measurement', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Failure', 'Flare', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'In complete remission', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Lupus', 'Lupus Nephritis', 'Maintenance Therapy', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Nephrology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Probability', 'Proteinuria', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'South Carolina', 'Specificity', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vasculitis', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'conventional therapy', 'ds-DNA', 'early detection biomarkers', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'mycophenolate mofetil', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'renal damage', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'sex', 'therapy development', 'treatment response', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2019,642740,136810522,-0.013888747780843601
"Shape up! Kids Project Summary/Abstract Of all markers of pediatric health, the most intuitive is body shape. Human and animal studies indicate that weight loss/gain correlates closely with increasing/decreasing insulin sensitivity, respectively. Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality risk than pediatric body mass index Z-score. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can quantify regional adiposity in more detail than these measures but is underutilized for many reasons including the sensitivity to children to ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments in optical technology to better describe phenotypes of pediatric body shape and its relation to metabolic risks (obesity, “failure to thrive”) and bone density and size. If successful, sophisticated obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment technology. The long term goal of the Shape Up! Kids Study is 1) to provide pediatric phenotype descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat) and bone mineral density (BMD) over a wide range of ages (5 to 18 years), weights and heights, stratified by sex, and ethnicity. Our central hypothesis is that optical estimates with shape classification of soft tissue composition and bone density better predict fracture and metabolic risk factors than anthropometry (WC, WHR, and BM) alone. The Investigators will highly leverage existing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Bone Mineral Density in Children Study. Our specific aims are: 1) Identify the unique associations of body shape to body composition and bone density indices in a pediatric population that represents the variance found in the US population, 2) Describe the precision and accuracy of optical scans to monitor change in body composition, bone density, 3) Estimate the level of association of optical scans to common health indicators including metabolic risk factors. Our exploratory aim is to investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self-assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US pediatric population, and to define how these models relate to important metabolic status indicators. The positive impact of these outcomes will be the immediate applicability to other researcher studies and clinicians using the automated tools and models developed here for 3D optical images. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of what children are at high risk of metabolic consequences of obesity. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults, and are becoming epidemic in children as well. This is relevant to the part of NIH's mission which focuses on the prevention of disease by supporting research in the diagnosis of human diseases.",Shape up!

"Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization Project Summary Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most diagnosed form of non-cutaneous cancer in US men. The selection of patients who require immediate treatment from those suitable for active surveillance currently relies on non- specific and inaccurate measurements. A method that allows clinicians to more confidently discriminate clinically relevant from non-life-threatening tumors is needed to improve patient management. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is the preferred non-invasive imaging modality for characterizing primary PCa. However, its accuracy for detecting clinically significant PCa is variable. We propose to address this limitation by combining mpMRI with positron emission tomography (PET) with a PCa-specific radiotracer and using advanced multimodal machine learning models (i.e. radiomics and deep learning) to characterize tumor aggressiveness based on the imaging data. Recently, scanners capable of simultaneous PET and MR data acquisition in human subjects have become commercially available. An integrated MR-PET scanner is the ideal tool for comparing MR and PET derived image features to identify those that provide complementary information and build a hybrid PET-mpMRI model that most accurately identifies clinically significant tumors. While this novel technology allows the acquisition of perfectly coregistered complementary anatomical, functional and metabolic data in a single imaging session, a new challenge needs to first be addressed to obtain quantitatively accurate PET data. In an integrated MR-PET scanner, the information needed for PET attenuation correction (AC) has to be derived from the MR data and the methods currently available for this task are inadequate for advanced quantitative studies. We have formed an academic-industrial partnership to accelerate the translation of multimodal MR-PET machine learning approaches into PCa research and clinical applications by addressing the AC challenge and validating machine learning models for detecting clinically significant disease against gold standard histopathology in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Specifically, we will: (1) Develop and validate an MR-based approach for obtaining quantitatively accurate PET data. We hypothesize that attenuation maps as accurate as those obtained using a 511 keV transmission source – the true gold standard for PET AC – will be obtained; (2) Identify the multimodal radiomics model that most accurately predicts PCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that the diagnostic accuracy of this approach will be superior to that offered by the stand-alone modalities; (3) Evaluate radiomics and deep learning approaches for predicting pPCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that machine learning approaches will achieve a higher predictive accuracy when applied to data acquired simultaneously than sequentially. Project narrative A better method to non-invasively characterize primary prostate cancer is needed to improve patient management. Extracting additional information from multimodality quantitative MR-PET data using machine learning approaches is expected to result in better diagnostic performance. In this work, we propose to accelerate the translation of quantitative MR-PET to prostate cancer research and clinical applications. In particular, we will develop and validate an MR-based attenuation correction approach to guarantee that quantitatively accurate PET data are obtained in an integrated MR-PET scanner and then use machine learning approaches to characterize the aggressiveness of the tumors in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.",Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization,9653979,R01CA218187,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Death Rates', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Histopathology', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kinetics', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prostate', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone imaging', 'cancer classification', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'men', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'radiotracer', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tumor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,663746,551214295,-0.0854738995086018
"Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification Project Abstract Motivation: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 500 million people. Children commonly develop CKD from urinary obstructive diseases and nephrotoxic therapies, and then suffer severe growth failure,  hypertension, cardiovascular risks, and neurocognitive deficits, and eventually end-stage kidney disease. Accurate renal function quantification will improve clinical management of hydronephrosis (1 in 100 babies) and  dosing/selection of chemotherapeutic regimens in oncology patients. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the biomarker of renal function, is derived from blood or urine tests. These tests only provide global GFR and are limited in accuracy, especially in children, and even more so in children with cancer. MRI offers superb anatomic delineation without ionizing radiation, and is thus ideal for pediatric kidney imaging. However, MRI has not been widely adopted for pediatric renal function evaluation due to lack of reliability and cumbersome workflow. These hurdles stem from the fact that the critical components required for global and regional GFR calculation, including high spatiotemporal resolution, plasma flow and arterial input function, are difficult to obtain, and that accurate image segmentation of kidneys (cortex and medulla) is labor intensive. Additionally, although the same contrast agent injection can be used for obstruction evaluation, certain areas of the kidney suffer from significant signal loss using standard MRI acquisition techniques due to high contrast agent concentrations. This project addresses these major challenges for automated comprehensive renal function evaluation in children. Approach: The project has three development aims, which are validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable novel free-breathing time-resolved 3D dynamic contrast enhanced MRI that simultaneously provides accurate GFR calculation and renal plasma flow. This is achieved by incorporating self-navigated motion compensation, fast acquisition with parallel imaging and compressed sensing, and phase-contrast flow imaging. The second aim is to develop multiple new image analysis methods to extract GFR and renal plasma flow (RPF) that  leverage novel flow data of Aim 1, as well as automated new machine-learning image processing techniques for the segmentation of kidneys and ultimately global and regional GFR calculation. In Aim 3, we will develop and integrate ultrashort-echo-time techniques to address the MRI signal loss due to T2* effects from high contrast concentration for patients with obstruction, and further incorporate motion compensation and accelerated  imaging methods to enable time-resolved high-resolution dynamic MRI for contrast washout kinetics analysis in the same MR exam. Aim 4 will determine the performance of these methods in a clinical setting. Significance: This work will lead to robust, automated comprehensive pediatric renal MRI for safer and more accurate renal function evaluation in children. The techniques will facilitate widespread application in the com- munity setting and permit robust evaluation of renal function, for both children and adults. Project Narrative Kidney diseases in children often stem from blockages of the urinary tract or toxicity from medications, such as antibiotics or chemotherapies. Kidney function quantification is crucial for clinical management of these children. This work will develop accurate and automated pediatric MRI for quantification of kidney function and diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction.",Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification,9677647,R01EB026136,"['3-Dimensional', '4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac Output', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Cone', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Hydronephrosis', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Obstruction', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Reflux', 'Regimen', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Renal Plasma Flow', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Urinary tract', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Venous', 'Work', 'antimicrobial drug', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'community setting', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast enhanced', 'data acquisition', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'kidney cortex', 'kidney imaging', 'loss of function', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'pressure', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem', 'urinary', 'urinary tract obstruction', 'urologic']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,665614,560644462,-0.0014474858871220974
"Confocal video-mosaicking microscopy to guide surgery of superficially spreading skin cancers Superficially spreading types of skin cancers such as lentigo maligna melanomas (LMMs) and non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) occur mostly on older patients, with diffuse sub-clinical sub-surface spread over large areas and with poorly defined margins that are difficult to detect. To treat these cancers, dermatologists rou- tinely perform a large number of mapping biopsies to determine the spread and margins, followed by surgical excision with wide ""safety"" margins. Not surprisingly, such a ""blind"" approach results in under-sampling of the margins, over-sampling of normal skin, too many false positives and false negatives, and too much loss of normal skin tissue. What may help address this problem is reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging to noninvasively delineate margins, directly on patients. RCM imaging detects skin cancers in vivo with sensitivity of 85-95% and specificity 80-70%. In 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services granted reim- bursement codes for RCM imaging of skin. RCM imaging is now being increasingly used to noninvasively guide diagnosis, sparing patients from unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions. While the two-decade effort leading to the granting of these codes was focused on imaging-guided diagnosis, emerging applications are in imaging to guide therapy. We propose to create an approach called RCM video-mosaicking, to noninvasively map skin cancer margins over large areas on patients, with increased sampling, accuracy and sparing of nor- mal tissue. The innovation will be in designing a highly robust (against tissue warping and motion artifacts) and high speed (real-time, seconds) approach for RCM video-mosaicking: we will develop an optical flow ap- proach with a novel hybrid 3-stage deep learning network comprising of 8 parameters that will model global and local rigid and non-rigid tissue motion dynamics, learn and adapt to variable tissue and speckle noise con- ditions in patients, and predict and automatically detect motion blur artifacts. As required by PAR-18-009, our academic-industrial partnership will deliver RCM video-mosaicking to clinicians for real-time implementation at the bedside (translational novelty). Our proposed application is for guiding surgical excision, but the approach will have wider impact, for guiding new and emerging less invasive non-surgical treatments for superficial skin cancers. In a preliminary study, we demonstrated RCM video-mosaicking with real-time speed (125 millisec- onds per frame, 8 frames per second), and registration errors of 1.02 ± 1.3 pixels relative to field-of-view of 1000 x 1000 pixels. Our specific aims are (1) to develop a real-time and robust RCM video-mosaicking ap- proach and incorporate into a handheld confocal microscope for use at the bedside, (2) to test the approach for image quality and clinical acceptability, and (3) to prospectively test on 100 patients, with pre-surgical video- mosaicking of LMM margins and superficial NMSC margins, followed by validation against post-surgical pa- thology. We are a highly synergistic team from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Northeastern Uni- versity, and Caliber Imaging and Diagnostics (formerly, Lucid Inc.), with a 13-year record of collaboration. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging can noninvasively diagnose skin cancers, and spare patients from biopsies of benign skin conditions. We propose to develop an approach to noninvasively delineate skin cancer margins, to help guide less invasive surgery, and help more accurately and completely remove cancer while preserving more of the surrounding normal skin.",Confocal video-mosaicking microscopy to guide surgery of superficially spreading skin cancers,9801564,R01CA240771,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Dermatologist', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Excision', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Grant', 'Hutchinson&apos', 's Melanotic Freckle', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Skin Carcinoma', 'Skin Tissue', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Video Microscopy', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'blind', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'design', 'expectation', 'human imaging', 'image guided', 'image guided therapy', 'imaging approach', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning network', 'microscopic imaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'older patient', 'preservation', 'prospective test', 'reflectance confocal microscopy', 'response', 'vector']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2019,667106,185946435,-0.025974894509420473
"Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking PROJECT SUMMARY  Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures tissue parameters such as T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion to detect subtle differences in tissue states (such as microstructure, diffuse fibrosis, edema, hemorrhage, and iron content) from neurological, oncological, and cardiovascular diseases. Because each parameter offers complementary tissue information, multiparameter mapping is very promising for risk assessment, early detection, accurate staging, and treatment monitoring of disease. However, quantitative MRI is typically very time consuming and difficult to perform. Each parameter is typically measured from its own series of images, so measuring multiple parameters leads to long, inefficient scanning sessions. Furthermore, cardiac and breathing motion creates misalignment between images, causing additional problems.  The standard approach to motion is to either remove it (e.g., ask the patient to hold their breath) or to synchronize image acquisition with it (e.g., using electrocardiography (ECG) to monitor cardiac motion). This approach makes scan times even longer, limits imaging to patients who can repeatedly perform long breath holds (which is difficult for aging or weak patients) and who have predictable cardiac motion (which is not true of patients with cardiac arrhythmias). Furthermore, these methods are often unreliable and difficult to perform.  This project is to develop and validate a new technology, MR Multitasking, to perform multiple simultaneous measurements in a single, push-button scan that is both comfortable for patients and simple for technologists to perform. MR Multitasking redesigns quantitative MRI around the concept of images as functions of many time dimensions, each corresponding to a different dynamic process (e.g., motion, T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion), and then uses mathematical models called low-rank tensors to perform fast, multidimensional imaging. This allows continuous acquisition of imaging data even while the subject is moving, providing motion-resolved parameter maps without breath holding or motion synchronization. We will scan healthy subjects, liver patients, prostate cancer patients, and cardiovascular patients to develop and validate this technology and use artificial intelligence to quickly reconstruct images from the collected data. The resulting tool will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to answer a wide range of biomedical questions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project is to develop and validate a one-stop, push-button solution for comprehensive, motion- resolved quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This will be accomplished by cultivating a new technology, MR Multitasking, which can measure multiple tissue biomarkers in a single scan, even in moving organs. The resulting technology will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to diagnose, monitor, and study a wide range of diseases.","Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking",9766063,R01EB028146,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Fibrosis', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Iron', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'body system', 'deep learning', 'heart motion', 'image reconstruction', 'magnetic field', 'magnetohydrodynamic', 'mathematical model', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'time use', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,676760,90419233,-0.021699811990930462
"Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Although cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are relatively rare causes of heart failure (HF), they are particularly challenging to detect and treat for several shared reasons: (1) on routine clinical imaging (i.e., echocardiography [echo]), they can be difficult to distinguish from superficially similar, more common forms of cardiac disease that cause left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy; (2) the diagnoses are often missed and thus patients can present late in the course of disease at a time when treatment is difficult; (3) objective, noninvasive metrics that reliably reflect disease progression have not been identified; and (4) the small number of known patients with these diseases can make epidemiology studies and clinical trials difficult to organize and conduct. For both cardiac amyloidosis and HCM, echo plays a critical role in both diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring given its ubiquitous clinical availability, safety, and low cost. More broadly, echo dominates the current landscape of routine cardiac imaging, with tens of millions of echos performed in the United States each year. However, the clinical challenges described above highlight several shortcomings of echo: it is limited in its ability to (1) diagnose disease at its early stages; (2) discriminate between morphologically similar diseases; and (3) quantify disease progression. This proposal seeks to address deficiencies in the current echo reading workflow, which is subjective and captures only a small fraction of the data available in each study. The overall objective of this application is to use advances in machine learning to develop and validate fully-automated echo image analytic approaches to diagnose and track rare cardiomyopathies, focusing on cardiac amyloidosis and HCM. Our proposal is centered on the hypothesis that highly scalable computer vision methods can be applied to echo studies to overcome limitations of the standard clinical echo reading workflow. Accordingly our aims are: (1) Apply an automated method for echo quantification and disease identification to detect and differentiate cardiac diseases that cause increased LV wall thickness; and (2) Characterize quantifiable echo measures of disease progression in cardiac amyloidosis and HCM and associate these with clinical outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team, which is composed of experts in cardiomyopathies, echocardiography, computer vision, and machine learning, will analyze echos and patient data from 2 large patient registries: the Multicenter Amyloid Phenotyping Study (MAPS) and the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) HCM Network, with validation using a repository of nearly 400,000 echos. The successful completion of our aims will result in an innovative tool for early diagnosis of myocardial diseases and tracking of disease progression. Importantly, our project will set the stage for conducting larger epidemiology studies of rare myocardial diseases by automating the identification of these patients, and thereby developing previously unattainable broad-based cohorts for these conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis (due to abnormal deposition of a protein into the heart muscle) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to a genetic mutation) are important causes of heart failure and sudden death in the general population. These heart diseases are difficult to diagnose, monitor, and treat because: (1) they appear superficially similar to more common forms of heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure) on imaging tests; (2) the optimal monitoring of disease progression over time has not been established; and (3) there is a lack of large-scale studies of patients with these diseases given their rarity. This project aims to use machine learning (artificial intelligence) of digital echocardiographic images to create a completely automated method for diagnosing and tracking these rare heart diseases with the ultimate goal of broad deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms in hospitals and clinics to help identify patients with these rare heart diseases earlier, better predict adverse outcomes, and increase the size and scope of patient registries to enhance research of these conditions.",Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases,9838368,R01HL140731,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloidosis', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Face', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Two-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'adverse outcome', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital', 'disease diagnosis', 'epidemiology study', 'heart imaging', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'particle', 'patient registry', 'repository', 'response', 'tool']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,687155,327644200,0.01597419283032129
"Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy Title: Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy ABSTRACT Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex, multifactorial, autoimmune disorder that affects ~1% of the worldwide population (~2 million adults in the US alone). It is characterized by chronic synovitis that, when left untreated, can result in irreversible joint destruction and deformity, leading to increased morbidity and all-cause mortality. The last three decades have witnessed impressive advances in the understanding of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic outcomes. In fact, the use of methotrexate first, and the subsequent incorporation of anti-TNF (TNFi) and other “biologics” have led to substantial improvements in RA clinical outcomes, enhancing the quality of life for millions of patients with inflammatory arthritis. Despite this progress, however, a significant question still remains unanswered: why do over 50% of RA patients with moderate to severe arthritis fail to respond appropriately to these agents? Pharmacomicrobiomics – an emerging field of study that investigates the effect of variations within the human gut microbiome on drugs – promises to overcome these barriers and facilitate precision medicine approaches in autoimmune disease.  Methotrexate (MTX), a dihydrofolate (DHF) reductase inhibitor, remains the anchor drug for the treatment of RA and is used widely throughout the world. While quite effective, oral MTX achieves significant results in less than 50% of patients and remission in only a quarter of them. It is well established that the inter-individual bioavailability of MTX is extremely variable, ranging from 10 to 80%. The reasons for this are presumably multifactorial. However, the intestinal microbiome and its enzymatic machinery are likely to play a significant role, based on our Preliminary Results and given that animals treated with antibiotics or kept under germ-free conditions show significant differences in MTX metabolism relative to control animals.  Our multidisciplinary team composed of rheumatologists, bioinformaticians, pharmacologists and microbiome researchers will address our overarching goal to study: a) if baseline intestinal microbiome, its genes, and associated metabolites can be used to predict the immunomodulatory responses to MTX in treatment-naïve, new-onset RA (NORA) patients; and b) if the gut microbiomes of MTX non-responders can be manipulated to modulate MTX metabolism and bioavailability. We believe that the results of our highly translational, innovative studies will directly influence therapeutic approaches for the treatment of RA and offer a more personalized approach in which the clinical efficacy response would be predicted early (and potentially improved by microbiome-targeted adjuvant therapies) in any given patient about to initiate MTX, limiting or preventing disease progression and ultimately avoiding wasteful health expenditures (estimated as ~$50,000/year/patient in direct costs). Importantly, we anticipate that our studies will establish generalizable approaches in rheumatology and autoimmunity that could be more broadly applied to the study and clinical maximization of other similar small molecules (e.g., JAK inhibitors) or even biologic agents (e.g., anti-TNF mAbs). NARRATIVE Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by widespread musculoskeletal inflammation affecting 1% of the world’s population (including ~2 million adults in the US alone). While the use of methotrexate (MTX) has significantly improved the lives of many people with RA, over 50% of patients do not respond adequately to this drug. Successful completion of our proposed studies will provide key insights into the effects of the gut bacteria on MTX and the implications for prediction of clinical response, ultimately identifying patients that are either likely to improve even before this treatment is prescribed, or those that would benefit from microbiome-targeted interventions to improve MTX absorption and efficacy.",Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy,9826831,R01AR074500,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Products', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biometry', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deformity', 'Diagnosis', 'Dihydrofolate Reductase Inhibitor', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Engraftment', 'Excess Mortality', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Free', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Role', 'Series', 'Structural Genes', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synovitis', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'absorption', 'arthritis therapy', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'chronic autoimmune disease', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'drug disposition', 'drug metabolism', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'germ free condition', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'joint destruction', 'joint injury', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome components', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'polyglutamates', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'rRNA Genes', 'recruit', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'rheumatologist', 'sample collection', 'small molecule', 'therapy outcome']",NIAMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,734366,329565273,-0.017055717292612935
"Automated image-based biomarker computation tools for diabetic retinopathy Abstract  In this SBIR project, we present EyeMark, a set of advanced image analysis tools for automated computation of biomarkers for diabetic retinopathy (DR) using retinal fundus images. Specifically, we will develop tools for computation of microaneurysm (MA) ap- pearance and disappearance rates (jointly known as turnover rates) for use as a bi- omarker in quantifying DR progression risk along with longitudinal analysis of other DR lesions. The availability of a reliable image-based biomarker will have high positive influ- ence on various aspects of DR care, including screening, monitoring progression, drug discovery and clinical research.  Measuring MA turnover and longitudinal analysis of DR lesions involves two labor in- tensive steps: careful alignment of current and baseline images, and marking of individual lesions. This process is very time consuming and prone to error, if done entirely by human graders. The primary goal of this project is to overcome these limitations by automating both the steps involved in longitudinal analysis: accurate image registration, and lesion identification.  We have designed and developed a MA turnover computation prototype tool that ro- bustly registers longitudinal images (even with multiple lesion changes) and effectively detects DR lesions (lesion level AUROC>=0.95). The tool provides graceful degradation to confounding image factors by reporting MA turnover as a range, thereby capturing the inherent confidence in MA detection. By the end of Phase IIB we will develop a market ready, clinically validated end-to-end desktop software for robust, automated longitudinal lesion analysis and characterization that can work on the cloud to produce results in near constant time (for large datasets), and also provide intuitive visualization tools for clinicians to more effectively monitor DR progression. Narrative The proposed tool, EyeMark, will greatly enhance the clinical care available to diabetic retinopathy (DR) patients by providing an automated tool for computation of an image- based, reliable, DR biomarker in a non-invasive manner. This will enable identification of patients who are at higher risk to progress to severe retinopathy, thus helping prevent vision loss in such patients by timely intervention. Early identification is especially important in face of long backlog of diabetic patients waiting for an eye examination, and the fact that 90% of vision loss can be saved by early identification. The availability of an effective biomarker will also positively influence the drug discovery process by facilitating early and reliable determination of biological efficacy of potential new therapies.",Automated image-based biomarker computation tools for diabetic retinopathy,9735477,R44TR000377,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Exudate', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Services', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lesion', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Microaneurysm', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pear', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'cloud based', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diabetic patient', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'fundus imaging', 'high risk', 'high throughput analysis', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'macula', 'medical schools', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'response', 'retinal imaging', 'screening', 'screening program', 'serial imaging', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'validation studies']",NCATS,"EYENUK, INC.",R44,2019,750000,1300000,0.004460817738714061
"Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure. Finally, WUSM will make a clear institutional commitment to maintain its Clinical Site, to adapt UDN Phase I practices for sustainability, to contribute to formation of a sustainable national UDN resource, and to adapt to unique needs and unexpected circumstances that may arise once Common Fund support ends in fiscal year 2022. 2.0 PROJECT NARRATIVE Undiagnosed diseases in children and adults represent frustrating and costly challenges for patients, families, physicians, and society. Building on established institutional infrastructure similar to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) will establish a UDN Clinical Site to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases, facilitate research into the etiology of undiagnosed diseases, and promote an integrated and collaborative community across multiple UDN Clinical Sites, Sequencing Cores, Model Organisms Screening Centers, and among laboratory and clinical investigators. Specifically, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will annually recruit, select, evaluate, and follow 30 participants with disorders in any clinical specialty, adult and pediatric, provide comprehensive clinical evaluations that require <5 days and follow up, and participate in all UDN protocols, data management and sharing, and sustainability planning.",Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site,9789913,U01HG010215,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accreditation', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Physicians', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Secure', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'network models', 'operation', 'outreach', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'student training', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,750000,533594881,-0.003027232731578353
"q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy Project Summary/Abstract  Ischemic heart disease remains the top cause of death in the world. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) causes regional dysfunction which places remote areas of the heart at a mechanical disadvantage resulting in long term adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling and complicating congestive heart failure (CHF). The course of MI and post-MI remodeling is complex and includes vascular and myocellular injury, acute and chronic inflammation, alterations of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and angiogenesis. Stress echocardiography is a clinically established, cost-effective technique for detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease and myocardial injury by imaging the LV at rest and after either exercise or pharmacologically-induced stress to reveal ischemia and/or scar. In our previous effort on this project, we developed quantitative 3D differential deformation measures for stress echocardiography from 4DE-derived LV strain maps taken at rest and after dobutamine stress. These measures can localize and quantify the extent and severity of LV myocardial injury and reveal ischemic regions. We now propose that improved versions of these same measures can be used for both targeting of therapy and outcomes assessment in the treatment of adverse local myocardial remodeling following MI. We choose a particular up and coming therapeutic strategy as an exemplar: the local delivery of injectable hydrogels within the MI region that are intended to alter the biomechanical properties of the LV myocardium, as well as inflammation, and thereby help to minimize adverse remodeling. Our new, robust approach for estimating improved dense displacement and differential deformation measures is based on an innovative data-driven, deep feed-forward, neural network architecture that employs domain adaptation between data from labeled, carefully-constructed synthetic models of physiology and echocardiographic image formation (i.e. with ground truth), and data from unlabeled noisy in vivo porcine or human echocardiography (missing or very limited ground truth). Training is based on tens of thousands of four-dimensional (4D) image-derived patches from these two domains, initially based on displacements derived separately from shape-based processing of conventional B-mode data and block-mode, speckle-tracked processing of raw radio-frequency (RF) data; and later based on learning directly from B-mode and RF image intensity information. After non-rigid registration of rest and stress 4DE image sequences, quantitative 4D differential deformation parameters will be derived from porcine and human echocardiographic test data. These parameters will be derived at baseline, and at several timepoints after delivery of injectable hydrogels into the MI region. The ability of the differential deformation parameters derived from 4D stress echocardiography to guide local delivery of injectable hydrogels in a MI region and assess/predict outcomes will then be determined in a hybrid acute/chronic porcine model of MI and post-MI remodeling. The technique will be translated to humans and evaluated by measuring the reproducibility and the relationship to remodeling of our new robust, deep learning-based differential deformation parameters in a small cohort of subjects. Project Narrative  At the core of the proposed effort is the development and evaluation of novel 4D (three spatial dimensions over time) echocardiographic imaging, image analysis, and machine learning methods that will enable the accurate and robust quantification of changes in myocardial deformation due to stress. Our methods will use this information to guide delivery and assess outcome of a promising new therapy to improve the biomechanical properties of the heart after myocardial injury based on injectable hydrogels.","q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy",9746883,R01HL121226,"['3-Dimensional', '4D Imaging', 'Acute', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dobutamine', 'Echocardiography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Family suidae', 'Four-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'Four-dimensional', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydrogels', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infarction', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injectable', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'Ischemia', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Remodeling', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitor', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Property', 'Recombinants', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Stains', 'Stress', 'Stress Echocardiography', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ultrasonography', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Remodeling', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cohort', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'feedforward neural network', 'heart imaging', 'human subject', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prevent', 'radio frequency', 'spatiotemporal', 'synthetic construct', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,824785,550947887,-0.001912855428079436
"Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disrupted circadian timing has emerged as a serious health and safety issue, yet there are no objective means of easily assessing circadian timing or alignment without performing a highly controlled, multiple-day in- patient study. Altered circadian timing can cause both sleep loss and sleepiness, cause performance errors such as motor vehicle accidents, and impair memory/learning. Thus, despite the obvious need to recognize an individual's circadian phase/alignment, we cannot assess circadian timing clinically or in retrospective studies. Not surprisingly, the first goal of the 2011 NIH Sleep Disorders Research Plan is to identify: ""...metabolic... biomarkers of sleep deficiency and biological timing...and circadian disorders that will facilitate personalized treatments, and clarify the risk associated with untreated sleep and circadian disorders and disturbances."" We are aware that major challenges face biomarker development, including multi-factorial causes of metabolite shifts normally controlled across multiple time-points. Because circadian time is associated with profound metabolic, immune and cardiovascular changes, however, we hypothesize that a biomarker signature for circadian phase derived from -omic markers can be obtained from a single blood sample. We therefore propose to utilize the analytical and bioinformatics platforms and experience in population-level metabolomics studies in the PIs lab to study banked plasma samples from the well-characterized individuals in six tightly controlled circadian rhythm studies run by the four co-investigators.The Aims are:  Aim 1: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and t cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics-  based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples drawn from three constant routine protocols Aim 2: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and to cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples  drawn from four forced desynchrony protocols  Aim 3: To systematically evaluate the validated profiles from Aims 1 and 2 and their mathematical  similarities and differences so as to improve accuracy and precision of the biomarkers  Aim 4: To test the markers identified above under poorly controlled real world applications Identification of biomarker panels will impact multiple aspects of science and health: (i) contribute to clinical recognition and treatment on circadian disorders; (ii) advance personalized medicine through individualized treatment timing to enhance efficacy/reduce side effects of medications (e.g., chemotherapy); (iii) creating epidemiologic tools to relate circadian with disease risk; and aiding development of other disease biomarkers, and; (iv) contribute to research on circadian biology and its implications for human health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to identify blood-based markers that can inform a clinician or researcher about an individual's internal biological clock. At the broad levels of society and public health research, the work has the potential direct benefit of identifying individuals with ""off-set"" clocks (enabling diagnosis and potential therapy), increasing accuracy and precision of studies of blood lipids, facilitating understanding of certain sleep disorders, increasing understanding of the role of biological clocks in chronic disease processes (e.g., cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease), and potentially improving the administration of certain pharmaceuticals, eg, chemotherapy agents.","Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting",9666966,R01HL132556,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Clocks', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Disease', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Drowsiness', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Memory impairment', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Strigiformes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker identification', 'biomarker panel', 'blood lipid', 'blood-based biomarker', 'chemotherapy', 'circadian', 'combinatorial', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'human population study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'men', 'metabolomics', 'personalized medicine', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'real world application', 'side effect', 'tool', 'vehicular accident']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,862336,327644200,-0.0029128369126422593
"Plaque Risk Stratification Using Routinely Available CCTA to Optimize Therapeutic Decision-making in Patients with Known or Suspected Coronary Artery Disease Project Summary/Abstract New treatments have been revolutionary in improving outcomes over the last 30 years, yet cardiovascular disease still exerts a $320B annual burden on the US economy. Increasing evidence is showing that Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) may be an ideal modality to fill gaps in understanding the extent and rate of progression coronary artery disease. But despite the apparent promise of CCTA, there are barriers that prevent realizing the improvement that it theoretically provides. Currently available solutions do not overcome the barriers – a new approach is needed. Elucid Bioimaging has developed an image analysis software product vascuCAP (CAP stands for Computer Aided Phenotyping) to accurately quantify structural and morphological characteristics of plaque tissues linked to plaque rupture vulnerability. Fundamental to our approach is validated, objective quantitative accuracy; vascuCAP enjoys the most robust and well documented analytic validation of any plaque morphology software available. vascuCAP is the only system to mitigate specific issues in CT reconstruction known to effect accurate measurement of atherosclerotic plaque composition in routinely acquired CTA; it is the only system to effectively leverage objective tissue characterization validated by histology across multiple arterial beds; it achieves an effective resolution with routinely acquired CTA in the same ballpark as IVUS VH, based on solid mathematics principles that respect the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem; and it innovates by novel reporting that expresses the findings in a manner that fits efficiently into existing clinical workflows. vascuCAP has been implemented in a client-server model supporting SaaS. Working from our strong current device clearances, this research strategy is developed based on approved meeting notes from the FDA pre-submission process Phenotype classification claims to be cleared through direct De Novo pathway on the basis of accurately determining the class from in vivo CTA data relative to pathologist annotation on ex vivo specimen data. Risk prediction claims: validate ability to predict adverse events at one year, adding the IFU according to the direct De Novo pathway, One does not strictly depend on the other.This proposal is innovative in dealing with two fundamental limitations of the application of artificial intelligence and deep learning to the analysis of atherosclerosis imaging data. This proposal maximizes use of available retrospective data while putting in place the necessary structure for prospective validation and scale up. This proposal further develops vascuCAP as a tool that may reduce cost and length of clinical trials. While out of scope for this grant, it is important to also note that vascuCAP is innovative in its ability to support multi-scale modeling across cellular/molecular-level analyses and macroscopic manifestation. Also, vascuCAP’s quantitative ability makes it ideal for analysis of more advanced CT imaging protocols. These attributes complement and support the proposed objectives.

"An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System In this SBIR Phase IIb proposal Xoran intends to commercialize a compact and affordable, yet highly- functional, system to provide real time image updates and navigation guidance in support of minimally invasive cranial and spinal neurosurgical procedures. The effort builds on previously developed compact and portable flat-panel Computed Tomography (CT) technology which has been commercialized for hard tissue applications, and incorporates work done in earlier phases of this project to generate viable high- quality images of the soft tissue structures in the brain. Intraoperatively obtained images tightly integrated into an onboard surgical navigation will provide updated instrument localization using next generation electromagnetic tool tip guidance. Workflow optimizations become possible when the imaging and guidance are one device, including fast local image updates, automatic image-to-world registration, as well as speed and simplicity of use. The project includes expansion of the system capabilities to facilitate precise minimally-invasive surgical removal of tumors in both the head and spine. It incorporates a machine-learning based deep neural network method for image finalization to allow high quality, low radiation image updates. The three-year project involves meeting technical milestones of system development including imaging capability, registration, navigation accuracy, speed, workflow, radiation dose considerations and cost. Clinical evaluations will take place at University of Michigan, and a team of consulting physicians has been assembled for oversight, input and feedback. Narrative / Relevance to Public Health Minimally invasive surgical procedures have many benefits to public health including reducing the medical risks and costs associated with brain cancer and spine surgery. However such procedures are often time consuming and technically difficult as the surgeon is unable to directly visualize the area of the operation. In this project, an intraoperative surgical system is developed with onboard imaging capability in order to enable minimally invasive surgeries to be performed more safely and completely, by providing hi-resolution imaging of the brain and spine while the surgeon operates.",An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System,9764897,R44CA112966,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Canis familiaris', 'Capital', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Cephalic', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Consult', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Electromagnetics', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Feedback', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Investments', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metals', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone', 'Michigan', 'Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures', 'Monitor', 'Navigation System', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Neurosurgical Procedures', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pituitary Neoplasms', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spine surgery', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tomography, Computed, Scanners', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Vertebral column', 'Veterinary Medicine', 'Veterinary Schools', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer site', 'cancer surgery', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'cranium', 'deep neural network', 'human subject', 'image guided', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'meetings', 'minimally invasive', 'neurosurgery', 'next generation', 'operation', 'point of care', 'portability', 'real-time images', 'research clinical testing', 'soft tissue', 'spine bone structure', 'tool', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,"XORAN TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R44,2019,1350820,1528783,-0.008724982699027127
"In-Office, Ultrasound-Based Breakage and Removal of Urinary stones OVERALL SUMMARY  The main focus of this Program Project Grant is to discover the foundational and translational knowledge needed to create an office-based handheld ultrasound device to target, detach, break, and expel stones and stone fragments from the urinary space to facilitate natural clearance. This system will obviate costly and inefficient emergency department visits that typically include repetitive exposure to ionizing radiation from diagnostic imaging, and will significantly reduce the often lengthy (days to weeks) wait time patients must endure before procedures for stone removal can be scheduled and performed. As the proposed therapy system is entirely noninvasive, patients will be treated on an outpatient basis. Further, as the system is designed to efficiently and painlessly break stones of any size and expel the fragments from the kidney, the treatment of both symptomatic and asymptomatic stones using this technology will reduce the high retreatment and stone event recurrence rates associated with current surgical interventions for stone removal.  In this effort, we will combine stone breakage by burst wave lithotripsy (BWL), clearance of fragments by ultrasonic propulsion (UP), and stone-specific ultrasound imaging (S-mode) into an integrated system in which exposure strategies are adapted during treatment in response to real-time acoustic feedback to enhance comminution efficiency and patient safety. We will tailor treatment by investigating numerically and in lab tests the primary mechanisms - cavitation and elastic waves - involved in the comminution process over a broad parameter space. We will develop acoustics-based feedback including model- based, machine learning and passive acoustic mapping (PAM) of the bubble field to signal the need to adjust the energy output. We will investigate the morphological and functional response of the kidney in living animals and in ex vivo perfused porcine kidneys, and pursue tissue protective treatment strategies such as power ramping.  These studies will include the first in-human test of BWL in which we will compare the comminution effectiveness and safety of treatment with and without adaptive output control in response to acoustic feedback. In addition, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of the benefits and risks of fragmenting and expelling symptomatic and asymptomatic stones in the clinic. Toward application of the system for use in humans, we will refine and validate the use of UP and S-mode together to improve stone and fragment detection. With our eye on the future of stone management, we will develop and validate in vivo an extracorporeal acoustic tractor beam to grasp and carry fragments through the complex three- dimensional path of the urinary space and out of the kidney. OVERALL NARRATIVE Urinary stone disease, which affects 1 in 11 Americans, is one of the most painful diseases and also the costliest non-malignant urologic disease, because current management is limited to observation for the stone to pass or performing surgery. The main focus of this Program Project Grant is to discover the foundational and translational knowledge needed to create an office-based, handheld ultrasound device to target, detach, break, and expel stones and stone fragments from the urinary space to facilitate natural clearance. This system will obviate costly and temporizing emergency department visits and radiation exposing imaging while the patient waits in pain for days to weeks for the stone to pass or be surgically removed.","In-Office, Ultrasound-Based Breakage and Removal of Urinary stones",9791705,P01DK043881,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Bowman&apos', 's space', 'Calibration', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lithotripsy', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Non-Malignant', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Painless', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Program Research Project Grants', 'Publications', 'Radiation exposure', 'Ramp', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Renal Tissue', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retreatment', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Schedule', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Wait Time', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'calcification', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'grasp', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individualized medicine', 'next generation', 'patient safety', 'programs', 'response', 'safety study', 'simulation', 'success', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,P01,2019,1619137,533302350,-0.0148182614252407
"Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) Overall Project Summary  The Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) pursues a mission of bringing people together to create new ways of seeing. The work of our Center has been focused on creating new paradigms for the acquisition, reconstruction, and interpretation of biomedical images, and on implementing new collaboration models in order to translate these developments rapidly into clinical practice.  The world of biomedical imaging is changing, and CAI2R has been at the forefront of that change. Tasks that were once the sole domain of meticulously-engineered imaging hardware are now beginning to be accomplished in software, increasingly informed by diverse arrays of inexpensive auxiliary sensors. Information once pursued through the laborious acquisition of carefully separated image datasets is now being derived from newly integrated, and richly quantitative, data streams. In keeping with these themes, our Center will be organized around the following four Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects going forward: 1. Reimagining the Future of Scanning: Intelligent image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis. 2. Unshackling the Scanners of the Future: Flexible, self-correcting, multisensor machines. 3. Enriching the Data Stream: MRI and PET in concert. 4. Revealing Microstructure: Biophysical modeling and validation for discovery and clinical care.  In each of these projects, we aim to push medical imaging technology to the next level, both in hardware and in software. Having made great strides in developing rapid, continuous imaging data streams, we will next aim to add key new information to those streams, both from physics-driven microstructural modeling and from data- driven machine learning. Having focused on the development of robust tools for image acquisition and reconstruction, we will extend the pipeline to image interpretation, using the results of human- or machine- derived evaluations of image content as feedback for the further improvement of acquisition strategies and sensor designs. We will also aim to close the loop between diagnostic sensing and therapeutic intervention, exploring new ways to guide therapy with continuously-acquired information about tissue bioeffects.  Our Center has an explicit translational focus, which is reflected in the day-to-day operation of TR&D projects as well as in the topics of Collaborative Projects (CPs) and Service Projects (SPs), which are focused on three general areas of high public health impact: cancer, musculoskeletal disease, and neurologic disease.  In keeping with this translational emphasis, CAI2R is also be driven by an embedded collaboration model in which basic scientists, clinicians, and industry developers sit down together regularly at the scanners for interactive technology development and assessment. With early involvement of clinical stakeholders and industry partners, we aim to make CAI2R technologies widely available, for the advancement of biomedical knowledge and for the benefit of patients and the physicians who care for them. Overall Project Narrative  The Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) develops novel imaging techniques and technologies for the improved diagnosis and management of cancer, musculoskeletal disease, neurological disease and other disorders with a profound impact on human health. By exploiting connections between imaging modalities such as MRI and PET, we aim to advance the fundamental capabilities of each, so as to expand biomedical knowledge and improve the care of patients.",Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R),9804438,P41EB017183,"['Adopted', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biology', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Engineering', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagination', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Industrial Product', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Philosophy', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Software Tools', 'Stream', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'bioimaging', 'biophysical model', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'flexibility', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'imaging scientist', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel imaging technique', 'off-patent', 'open source', 'operation', 'radio frequency', 'reconstruction', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'technology research and development', 'tool', 'web site']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,P41,2019,1715698,329565273,-0.0047182159682931865
"Combined Cardiopulmonary Failure in COPD: SPIROMICS HF The death rate and hospitalizations from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have doubled in the last 50 years. A third of COPD hospitalizations overlap with heart failure, mostly with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), yet no large COPD study has ascertained cardiac function. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) COPD Study was funded to test the endothelial hypothesis of emphysema and examine reduced RV dimensions (“cor pulmonale parvus”) in COPD. In the MESA COPD Study II, we found that associations of reduced pulmonary microvascular blood flow with emphysema do not appear to be confounded by hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and that emphysema on CT predicted RV regression over 5 years. We also developed methods to further subtype emphysema and COPD and scaled them up to the SubPopulations and InteRmediate Outcome Measures In COPD Study (SPIROMICS). We used unsupervised machine learning to discover new emphysema subtypes that are common and have molecular origins. Separately, we found that 26% of adults have segmental airway variants, which are associated with COPD and the developmental genes FGF10 and RARA. Both genes affect right heart development. In pilot work, we found one dramatically altered RV strain and the other associated with cor pulmonale parvus. Finally, we found that bronchitic ‘symptomatic smokers,’ who have hyperinflation from gas trapping, may have increased LV diastolic dysfunction. Hence, cardiac alterations in COPD are complex but recent advances in COPD subtyping may allow their personalized diagnosis and treatment. SPIROMICS is an NHLBI-funded prospective study that recruited smokers with COPD and controls and is re-examining 2,000 participants with gold- standard lung phenotyping including full-lung CT. We propose to add comprehensive echocardiography (echo) with speckle-tracking for cardiac mechanics for 1,000 SPIROMICS participants, with exercise in 700 and cardiopulmonary MRI in 600, to test the following hypotheses: 1) machine-learned subtypes of emphysema on CT are associated with specific alterations in cardiac structure and function, which vary from cor pulmonale to LV diastolic dysfunction; 2) participants with segmental airway variants have abnormal RV structure and function; 3) symptomatic smokers have signs of increased LV afterload and LV diastolic dysfunction. Innovative aspects of the application include the use of novel echo and MRI measures in a large, well- characterized cohort of COPD patients. Confirmation of the hypotheses would define the mechanisms of HFpEF in COPD and identify subsets of patients for targeted treatment of cardiopulmonary dysfunction. The death rate and hospitalizations from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have doubled in the last 50 years. A third of COPD hospitalizations overlap with heart failure, mostly with preserved ejection fraction. The proposed study would be the first large study with gold-standard phenotyping of the heart and lungs and would test highly specific hypothesized based upon recent advances in lung subphenotyping to yield personalized approaches to combined cardiopulmonary disease in COPD.",Combined Cardiopulmonary Failure in COPD: SPIROMICS HF,9819260,R01HL093081,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Apical', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DRD1 gene', 'Death Rate', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Drops', 'EFRAC', 'Echocardiography', 'Endothelium', 'Exercise', 'FGF10 gene', 'Failure', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gases', 'Genes', 'Gold', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypoxia', 'Impairment', 'Kinetics', 'Lung', 'Lung CAT Scan', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Myocardial', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Pulmonary Heart Disease', 'Pulmonary artery structure', 'RARA gene', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Right Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Right ventricular structure', 'Sampling', 'Smoker', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiogenesis', 'cohort', 'disorder control', 'disorder subtype', 'genetic variant', 'heart function', 'heart preservation', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'patient subsets', 'personalized approach', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'receptor', 'recruit', 'targeted treatment', 'unsupervised learning', 'vasoconstriction']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,2391491,558628098,-0.001846935956500176
"Aging eyes and aging brains in studying alzheimer's disease: Modern ophthalmic data collection in the adult changes in thought (ACT) study PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT The overarching goals of this R01 proposal are to improve scientific understanding of potential mechanisms by which ophthalmic diseases lead to the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. The investigators will leverage modern ophthalmic data with state-of-the-art imaging and extensive archived clinical data from a well-characterized cohort of older adults. The investigators propose to examine the effect of structural and functional changes in retina and longitudinal severity of ophthalmic diseases on Alzheimer’s disease and related neuropathology. The proposal builds on the resources of the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study, a prospective longitudinal, population-based, dementia-free cohort of over 5,500 people to date established in 1994 which has detected >1,014 research quality diagnoses of Alzheimer’s disease and >1,254 dementia to date. ACT follows consenting participants to autopsy and has performed state-of-the arts autopsy on >781 decedents to date. In this extremely well-characterized cohort, the investigators found that several ophthalmic diseases (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration) are significantly associated with the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. The investigators will use three advanced ophthalmic imaging modalities at both home and clinical research study visits: fundus photography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and OCT angiography (OCTA), to obtain quantitative data relevant to these ophthalmic diseases. The study team will establish the distribution (Aim 1a) and 2- and 4-year evolution of ophthalmic imaging characteristics found in older adults in the community and determine associations with change in cognition (Aim 1 b, c). Additionally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI angiography (MRA) will be obtained in a subset of participants to investigate the contribution of small (retinal) and large (cerebral) vascular disease towards cognitive changes (Aim 1d). The study team will continue ACT study’s strong commitment for meaningful data sharing. In collaboration with the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging at University of Southern California, the study team will promulgate these ophthalmic data in addition to neuroimaging data to the research community (Aim 1e). In Aim 2, the investigators will use extensive clinical ophthalmology data captured over many decades and incorporate them in novel longitudinal models of eye disease severity. The investigators will analyze eye disease severity along with extensive neuropathology data from the ACT study, including both standard (Aim 2a) and novel quantitative (Aim 2b) neuropathology data, to further scientific understanding of neuropathological mechanisms underlying associations between eye conditions and Alzheimer’s disease risk. The brain is not amenable to direct observations during life. In contrast, the eye is an anterior extension of the central nervous system and may provide a valuable window to illuminate neurodegenerative processes in the aging brain. Proposed investigations will substantially enhance scientific understanding of the role of modern ophthalmic evaluations in delineating risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of neuropathology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Using a large, well-characterized, longitudinal, prospective, cohort study, the study team previously found that diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration were significantly associated with Alzheimer’s disease risk. The team proposes to use three cutting edge ophthalmic imaging modalities to obtain quantitative data at both home and clinic research study visits in addition to MRI and MRA in a subset of participants to evaluate their associations with change in cognition over time (Aim 1). The team will leverage extensive ophthalmic clinical and neuropathological data already available for 781 study participants to date as well as new state-of-the-art quantitative measures of beta amyloid (A1-42) and phosphorylated tau to elucidate mechanisms underlying associations between ophthalmic conditions and Alzheimer’s disease (Aim 2).",Aging eyes and aging brains in studying alzheimer's disease: Modern ophthalmic data collection in the adult changes in thought (ACT) study,9816310,R01AG060942,"['Abbreviations', 'Adult', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Angiography', 'Anterior', 'Archives', 'Autopsy', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drusen', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Fundus photography', 'Ganglion Cell Layer', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neuraxis', 'Occipital lobe', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Selection Bias', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'aging brain', 'area striata', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis quality', 'epidemiology study', 'fiber cell', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'paired helical filament', 'population based', 'prospective', 'repository', 'research study', 'resilience', 'spelling', 'tau Proteins', 'tau-1', 'vascular contributions']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,3869686,533302350,-0.07702953672345
"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium. In this revised application, the overall themes remain unchanged but Cores leadership and direction has been markedly refined. Project Narrative The New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS), as a member of the CTSA Consortium, unites Rutgers University, Princeton University, the New Jersey Institute of Technology, clinical, community and industry partners in a shared vision to make New Jersey a healthier state. Building on New Jersey’s already significant capabilities to promote and facilitate clinical and translational research, NJ ACTS will serve as a catalyst, inspiring new approaches to diagnose and manage disease, and fostering career development of the next generation of translational researchers, and promoting population health.",New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS,9831333,UL1TR003017,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Asian Indian', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Health Centers', 'Cuban', 'Databases', 'Dental', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease Management', 'Diverse Workforce', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Mission', 'Muslim population group', 'New Jersey', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Ontology', 'Oral health', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'School Nursing', 'Science', 'Solid', 'South Asian', 'Special Populations Research', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Workforce Development', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'career development', 'catalyst', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohesion', 'community based participatory research', 'disease heterogeneity', 'ethnic diversity', 'ethnic minority population', 'follower of religion Jewish', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'logarithm', 'medical schools', 'member', 'natural language', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'population health', 'programs', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'treatment response', 'trial design']",NCATS,RUTGERS BIOMEDICAL/HEALTH SCIENCES-RBHS,UL1,2019,4776211,19710604,-0.010516522894167445
"Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine Project Summary Cardiac surgery has been a highly innovative field of medicine. The introduction of major innovations, and ongoing incremental change in existing ones, have extended survival and improved quality of life for many patients suffering from cardiac disease. A rapid pace of innovation requires a rigorous infrastructure for clinical evaluation that provides timely assessments of the value of new and modified treatments. The Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) was created to provide a rigorous evidence base tor the surgical treatment of cardiothoracic disease. The International Center for Health Outcomes and Innovation Research (InCHOIR) enthusiastically embraces the opportunity to continue to work in partnership with clinical investigators and the NIH as the CTSN DCC. The Network has developed a rich research agenda for the renewal that includes trials of novel neuroprotective agents, long-term antithrombotic strategies, new regenerative medicine therapies, and surgical approaches to valvular disease, heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Given our long-standing interest and experience in the design and analysis of cardiac surgery multicenter studies, we are in a strong position to serve as the coordinating center for this vital clinical research effort. In particular, we will provide leadership in designing novel trials that optimize sample size, include patient- centered as well as clinical endpoints, and collect data from a variety of sources, including electronic data capture systems, mobile apps and wearable sensors, registries and electronic health records. We have a strong track record of obtaining efficient regulatory approval for our trials from the FDA and Health Canada, training and monitoring sites nationally and internationally, ensuring robust enrollment and retention, data management and quality assurance, data sharing, and overall administrative coordination. We have the infrastructure to expand our trials to include mechanistic studies that use biospecimens collected and managed through the CTSN biorepository. Finally, the DCC plays an important role in the analysis, interpretation and dissemination of research findings. We will continue to support the process of publishing in high-impact journals that should lead to revision of practice guidelines and to surgical practice itself. This goal should be further optimized by incorporating Implementation Science approaches into Network trials, which should decrease the well-recognized gap between publication of trial results and adoption of findings into widespread practice. NARRATIVE Clinical trials are a critical step in translating discoveries into better treatments for people burdened by cardiac disorders. Such trials typically require cooperation and coordination among a broad range of investigators, patients, government agencies, and industry partners. The objective of the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) is to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of clinical research through shared infrastructure for important trials that will advance therapy for patients suffering from cardiac disease.",Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine,9753639,U01HL088942,"['Address', 'Administrative Coordination', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Ancillary Study', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Canada', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Industry', 'Information Technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Manuscripts', 'Mediation', 'Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Secure', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Site', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'design', 'dissemination research', 'electronic data', 'electronic data capture system', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'international center', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'performance site', 'prospective', 'quality assurance', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'research data dissemination', 'screening', 'tool', 'trial design', 'wearable device']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2019,7220733,415711940,-0.006281628722029077
"MICCAI 2018 - 21th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention Project Summary The Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) society is dedicated to the promotion, preservation, facilitation of research and education in the fields of medical image computing (MIC) and computer assisted interventions (CAI) including biomedical imaging and robotics; this is achieved through the organization and operation of regular international conferences of highest quality and publications which promote and foster the exchange and dissemination of advanced knowledge, expertise and experience in the field produced by leading institutions and outstanding scientists, physicians, and educators around the world. MICCAI Conferences have their roots and origin in three separate but related conferences beginning in early 1990s, the Visualization in Biomedical Computing (VBC), Computer Vision and Virtual Reality in Robotics and Medicine (CVRMed), and Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery (MRCAS), which merged into a single annual conference in 1998. MICCAI Conferences have defined a new scientific discipline over the years and have become the premier conference in the field with their proceedings having an impact factor comparable to high-impact computational journals. Conference topics include, computer vision & image processing for medical imaging, computer-aided diagnosis, computer-assisted intervention & surgery, guidance systems & robotics, visualization and virtual reality, bioscience and biology applications, specific imaging systems and new biomedical imaging applications, spanning disciplines such as radiology, pathology, surgery, oncology, cardiology, physiology, and psychiatry. The main MICCAI conference includes three days of oral presentations and poster sessions. The quality and importance of poster presentations are considered to be on a par with those of oral presentations, with both undergoing a rigorous double-blinded peer-review (~30% acceptance) and several presented papers becoming landmark publications over the years reaching up to 2,000 citations. The conference series includes community-driven software challenges, workshops and tutorials just before and/or after the main conference. These satellite events focus in detail on the current status and advances in topics relevant to MICCAI and are very highly attended. The MICCAI Conferences span the entire globe and are usually rotated among the American, European, and Asian continents. Attendance typically includes more than 45 countries, with strong student representation (~40%). The MICCAI 2018 Conference will be held in Granada, Spain in September 16th-20th, 2018. An innovative aspect of MICCAI 2018 is the initiation of a “Mentoring Program” to connect students and young investigators with established mentors from academia and industry. Along with the mission of “Women in MICCAI” committee, this proposal requests funds to initiate and ultimately sustain student travel awards to specifically enhance diversity in conference attendance, including women, underrepresented minorities, students with disabilities, and students from disadvantaged backgrounds, to present their work, providing them with a unique opportunity to reach an international audience for career development and collaborations.

"Sequencing and Genotyping in Diverse Populations:  Who Wants What Back (and When)? PROJECT SUMMARY The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a national annual mid-sized conference series held in Cleveland, Ohio. The conference series aims to serve as a venue for the continuing education and exchange of scientific ideas related to the rapidly evolving and highly interdisciplinary landscape that is precision medicine research. The topics for each conference coincide with the national conversation and research agenda set by national research programs focused on precision medicine. The 2018 conference is a symposium that will focus on issues related to return of genomic results both in clinical and research settings with an emphasis on diverse populations. The conference will be organized as a traditional format with invited speakers from among national experts for topics ranging from issues returning research results to culturally diverse participants and family members, inclusion of diverse patient and participant populations in the Clinical Sequencing Evidence- Generating Research (CSER) consortium and the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program, pharmacogenomics-guided dosing and race/ethnicity, strategies used to return results, among others. 2019 and beyond conference topics are being considered from previous symposia attendees and trends in precision medicine research. Odd-numbered year conferences include a workshop component that has previously covered outcome and exposure variable extraction from electronic health records. Future workshop topics being considered include integration of multiple ‘omics, drug response in different populations, pharmacogenomics clinical implementation, precision medicine in cancer, data sharing and informed consent, and the use of apps for recruitment, diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment. Our second major objective of this conference series is the promotion of diversity in the biomedical workforce. It is well-known that the pipeline from training to full professor for women in biomedical research is leaky whereas the pipeline for under-represented minorities is practically non-existent. Drawing from national and local sources, we vet women and under-represented minorities for every invited speaker opportunity, thereby providing valuable career currency and networking opportunities. We will also encourage women and under-represented minorities, particularly at the trainee level, to attend and participate in this conference series to spur interest in pursuing precision medicine research as a career. Overall, the North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine series is a valuable addition to the national conference landscape, and with its unique location and low cost to participants, will serve as an important educational opportunity as precision medicine research accelerates in earnest. PROJECT NARRATIVE The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a yearly fall conference series in Cleveland, Ohio designed as a continuing education forum in the burgeoning area of precision medicine research. The conference brings together national experts on a host of topics ranging from bioethics to bioinformatics to biomedical informatics to speak and lead workshops on timely challenges posed in translating complex genomic and health data into clinical practice. The conference series also serves to promote diversity in the biomedical workforce. This year’s symposium will focus issues related to return of genomic results in both clinical and research settings with an emphasis on diverse populations.",Sequencing and Genotyping in Diverse Populations:  Who Wants What Back (and When)?,9612854,R13HG010286,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acceleration', 'African American', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Bioethics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Continuing Education', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family member', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informed Consent', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'PMI cohort', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Series', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Translating', 'Travel', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Woman', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data sharing', 'design', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'forging', 'frontier', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'health data', 'health disparity', 'health information technology', 'incentive program', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'medical specialties', 'multiple omics', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'posters', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'science education', 'senior faculty', 'symposium', 'trend']",NHGRI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R13,2018,10000,197030888,-0.007546641425503918
"2018 International Molecular and Functional Pulmonary Imaging Workshop SUMMARY This application requests funding to support the 2018 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging, a three- day meeting scheduled for December 6-8, 2018, which will be the sixth of its kind hosted by the University of Pennsylvania. The requested funds will primarily be used to cover travel and housing expenses for undergraduate, graduate and junior faculty speakers. Some may also be used to support live webcasting and publication of the workshop proceedings. As in the past, it is our intention to broadcast each session of the meeting online in real-time, enabling interested parties who cannot physically attend to access them free of charge. Pulmonary diseases constitute a significant and rising cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and imaging is becoming an increasingly important source of innovative techniques for both diagnosing and treating these pathologies. The field of pulmonary imaging currently encompasses a wider range of techniques for the functional, structural and molecular assessment of lung disorders than ever before, which are being developed and refined by investigators across a diverse set of fields such as biology, physics, chemistry, medicine and engineering, computer science and machine learning. Given the rapidly-developing nature of the pulmonary imaging field, it is of the utmost importance that a regular forum exists for scientists and clinicians to communicate and debate their ideas with one another. In the absence of other meetings with a similar focus, our previous workshops have provided such a forum, bringing together the diverse components of the field into the kind of rigorous, focused exchange needed to advance the field. The specific aims of the proposed workshop are as follows: (1) keep the pulmonary imaging community informed about the latest developments in structural, functional and molecular lung imaging; (2) examine the use of pulmonary imaging to assess therapeutic response, including strategies for overcoming the challenges inherent in this objective; (3) explore the integration of machine learning with pulmonary imaging techniques to more accurately phenotype disease and predict injury progression; (4) broadcast the entire proceedings live over the web, allowing non-attendees to freely access the proceedings, and enabling the online audience to participate in workshop discussions in real-time. Based on feedback from participants that previous meetings tended to be overly dense and predominantly didactic in nature, we have also implemented a significant format change for proposed 2018 meeting. With the exception of a few keynote presentations, we plan to limit the percentage of formal lecture in each invited speaker’s talk to one-third of their allotted time, with the rest dedicated to a period of discussion that will be driven by a panel of moderators as well as audience questions. For each presentation, the moderators will prepare a list of questions focusing on three main points: 1) the translatability of the research being presented, 2) the scientific gap which this research aims to address, and 3) the necessity of identifying lung disorders that are suitable for longitudinal studies, as well as which imaging parameters are best suited to the longitudinal study of lung disease. In addition to this change in format, the 2018 workshop will continue efforts to strike a more even balance between functional, structural and molecular imaging approaches to pulmonary disease. Finally, we will also continue to foreground the important issue of using imaging techniques to assess treatment response, which was first introduced at the 2017 pulmonary imaging workshop. NARRATIVE This application requests funding to support the 2018 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging at the University of Pennsylvania. The proposed meeting will provide a valuable opportunity for researchers engaged in the development of functional, structural, and molecular imaging techniques for assessing lung diseases—such as COPD, ARDS, IPF and lung cancer—to meet and discuss their work with one another. The entirety of the workshop will be broadcast live online, giving interested individuals who are not able to attend in person the ability to both view and participate in its proceedings.",2018 International Molecular and Functional Pulmonary Imaging Workshop,9613494,R13HL144010,"['Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Charge', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Equilibrium', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Heart', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intention', 'International', 'Internet', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pennsylvania', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Protons', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Pulmonology', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'density', 'disease phenotype', 'imaging approach', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lectures', 'lung imaging', 'meetings', 'molecular imaging', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'patient response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'treatment response', 'undergraduate student']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R13,2018,29805,593605914,-0.00792947722317922

"An automated and massively scalable platform for organismal and developmental genetics Project Summary Sleep regulation plays a critical role in proper neurological development. During sleep, there is enhanced synaptic plasticity in the nervous system in addition to often extensive neural remodeling. Although we know that sleep regulation is important to neurological development, many aspects of sleep regulation are poorly understood. In particular, the mechanisms of how we compensate for missed sleep in future sleep cycles are mysterious, despite general knowledge of how circadian rhythms are established. It is likely that these mechanisms involve neuropeptide signaling in the brain. However, current tools to study the roles these peptides play in sleep homeostasis, even with the use of simple model organisms like C. elegans, are low- throughput, qualitative, and subjective. In order to study sleep-like behavior in C. elegans, there is an unmet need for a tool for continuously monitoring and perturbing long-term behavior of the worm, as well as an automated and un-biased method for quantifying behavioral data. In this proposal, we will first develop the enabling technology, and use it to identify the roles of neuropeptides in homeostasis of the nematode’s sleep- like state. In Aim I, we will engineer and validate a scalable microscopy platform for monitoring and perturbing C. elegans behavior, decreasing the cost of long-term candidate screens by ~ 100 fold. In Aim 2, we will quantify behavior of wild-type animals via an automated and bias-free quantitative analysis to establish baseline behavior and prioritize behaviors that are linked to sleep homeostasis. In Aim 3, we will use the technology developed in Aims I and 2 to quantify differences in behavior of C. elegans neuropeptide mutants using a candidate approach. Because of the strong preliminary data we have gathered so far and the experience of the sponsor’s laboratory, this proposed work is likely to identify the roles of these candidate neuropeptides in sleep homeostasis, contributing to our mechanistic understanding of sleep regulation. Furthermore, the tools we develop for this particular study will also have broad utilities in many other problems, such as developmental programming, aging, and neurobehavioral studies. Project Narrative Sleep regulation plays a critical role in proper brain development and is linked to a variety of neurological and behavioral disorders. In particular, how animals correct for interrupted sleep cycles in future cycles could lead to therapeutic targets, but apart from a few implicated neuropeptides, little is known about the mechanisms behind this aspect of sleep. The objective of this proposal is to identify the roles of neuropeptides in sleep homeostasis by screening C. elegans mutants for behavioral defects.",An automated and massively scalable platform for organismal and developmental genetics,9545566,F31GM123662,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Characteristics', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drug Screening', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Interruption', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Middle Insomnia', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropeptides', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Reproduction', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Study models', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'age related', 'behavioral study', 'circadian pacemaker', 'cost', 'developmental genetics', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mutant', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurobehavioral', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'sleep regulation', 'software development', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2018,44524,45341731,-0.01219535288934141
"Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (MiEED) PROJECT SUMMARY In this application, I am requesting support from a career development award to support my research proposal titled “Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction”. I will be undertaking this work with the mentorship of Dr. Jeffrey Gordon (Primary US mentor) at the Washington University, St Louis and Dr. Asad Ali (Primary LMIC mentor) at the Aga Khan University. This project builds on our existing studies of Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED), funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The current application aims to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of EED by studying the evolution of gut microbial configuration in children who have clinical and histological evidence of EED. EED is common in children living in impoverished conditions with limited access to clean drinking water and sanitation. Histopathological changes of EED in small bowel mucosa include alteration in crypt to villous ratio along with lymphocytic infiltration of the villous epithelium and lamina propria. Although studies involving biopsies of small bowel mucosa are critical to study EED, these studies are uncommon because of logistic challenges involving performing endoscopies in field settings in LMICs. We have previously demonstrated in an ongoing BMGF funded study that we are able to safely obtain such biopsies, we now have a unique opportunity to study the relationship between gut microbiome evolution and EED in this cohort. The central hypothesis of the current application is that children with histological confirmation of EED have shared features of a bacterial community which is different from healthy controls and non-EED subjects, and that such changes in bacterial configuration are associated with enteric and systemic inflammation. For testing these hypotheses, evaluation of gut microbiome in healthy and stunted children will be carried out to identify the age discriminatory bacterial taxa in children with and without confirmation of EED. Dr. Gordon will be providing mentorship and experience in gut microbiome and microbiota analysis. Dr. Ali will provide the needed infrastructure of the field site and laboratory facilities, along with linking the microbiome analysis with clinical and histological outcomes of interest. The Aga Khan University is a leading regional research institute with multiple support systems for junior investigators which will be vital for my career transition as an independent scientist. My long term goal is to be the principal investigator of my own laboratory, focusing on studying the gut microbiome and its relationship with communicable and non-communicable diseases. I envision working on microbiota derived therapy for EED, and to find targets in the inflammatory pathways driven by changes in gut homeostasis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Globally, Pakistan has the third highest rate of stunting among children aged < 5 years. Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED) is proposed to be a critical factor responsible for chronic growth faltering in children in resource limited settings. This research utilizes an innovative approach to study a program of postnatal gut microbiome development in children and its impact on child growth. This proposal will provide an ideal training platform for a translational scientist, covering the domains of mucosal immunology, histopathology, computational analysis, microbiome analysis and host immune responses. The skills learnt from this project will be critical for the capacity development of both the LMIC institution and the candidate herself.","Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (MiEED)",9549157,K43TW010697,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Bangladesh', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Career Mobility', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Duodenum', 'Endoscopy', 'Enteral', 'Epithelium', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Gut Mucosa', 'Height', 'Histologic', 'Histopathologic Grade', 'Histopathology', 'Homeostasis', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Impairment', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Institution', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lamina Propria', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Milieu Therapy', 'Modeling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Pakistan', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Small Intestines', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Sustainable Development', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Villous', 'Washington', 'Weight', 'Work', 'aged', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cytokine', 'drinking water', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'fecal microbiota', 'forest', 'global health', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'host microbiome', 'immune activation', 'immune function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intestinal villi', 'laboratory facility', 'learning strategy', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiota', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'rRNA Genes', 'skills', 'translational scientist']",FIC,AGA KHAN UNIVERSITY (PAKISTAN),K43,2018,62726,282635,-0.029851111826985303
"QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tissue identification and quantification plays a significant role in the study of aging and age-related diseases. For example, the accumulation of fat in the human body and its regional distribution with aging is associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Changes in muscle composition are strongly linked to decline of muscle strength, decreased mobility caused by aging, or musculoskeletal disorders. Especially interesting is analysis of longitudinal changes of morphometric descriptors that is significant for studying the aging process and for the diagnosis and prevention of age-related diseases.  Medical imaging has emerged as a major tool for estimation of body composition mainly due to being non- invasive and producing multi-dimensional information. Nowadays MRI and CT acquisition is a central component of clinical trials. An abundance of imaging data is collected, but this wealth of information has not been utilized to full extent. Therefore research on image analysis techniques for tissue quantification that are reproducible and can be used on large-scale clinical trials is of particular importance.  The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse body composition data from modern MRI and CT imaging. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that qualitative body composition phenotypes on clinical imaging will differentiate individuals who are healthy versus those who are not. The goal of our work is to provide a foundation for image analysis of the abdomen and lower extremities and to study the relationship between body morphological changes and age-related pathologies.  We will build upon recent advances in medical image computing to segment muscle, regional adipose tissue, and bone in clinical CT and MRI scans. We will also develop image registration procedures to achieve intra- and inter-subject correspondence and make efficient use of information provided by multi-modal and multi-temporal imaging data collected in clinical trials (aim 1). After these methods have been developed, we will address the hypothesis that quantitative use of clinical imaging can increase the prognostic accuracy of age-related pathologies (aim2). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age-related diseases such as type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and sarcopenia have become a worldwide epidemic and affect the quality of life of millions. To give a global perspective, roughly 343.8 million people in the world have type-2 diabetes today, and 175 million don't know they have diabetes at all. Metabolic diseases are strongly linked to longitudinal changes in body composition, morphology and function. This project will contribute novel and non-invasive medical image analysis techniques for studying the human body composition and its changes with increasing age to achieve timely prognosis of these pathologies.",QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES,9449456,SC3GM113754,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Technique', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delaware', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Techniques', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age related', 'biophysical model', 'bone', 'clinical imaging', 'disease diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'morphometry', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'reduced muscle strength', 'sarcopenia', 'statistics', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY,SC3,2018,64155,4139254,0.007253671986119038
"Fast and Robust Low-Dose X-Ray CT Image Reconstruction Abstract:  The use of CT scans has recently increased, for example, in virtual colonoscopy, CT cardiac screening, screening of the lung in smokers, whole-body CT in asymptomatic patients, and CT imaging of children. Shortening of the scanning time to around 1 second, eliminating the strict need for the subject to remain still or be sedated, is one of the main reasons for the large increase in the pediatric population. CT scans of children have been estimated to produce non-negligible increases in the probability of lifetime cancer mortality, leading to calls for the use of reduced current settings for CT scans of children. For these reasons, the CT industry has put in a lot of effort to develop low-dose CT. One active area of research is methods to reduce the radiation counts by applying adaptive collimation to block unnecessary x-ray photons. Another active area of research is the development of more robust image reconstruction algorithms that are less sensitive to noise for low-count data.  This grant proposal is focused on the second approach — development of fast and robust reconstruction algorithms. It is known that some iterative image reconstruction algorithms outperform the analytical filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm in terms of producing less-noisy images with the same data set. One disadvantage of these iterative algorithms is their long computation time, making them impractical in a real- world CT reconstruction tasks. For this reason, the FBP algorithm is still the main work horse for CT applications.  The main goal of the proposed research is to develop fast and robust iterative-algorithms so that their computation time is at the same order of an analytic FBP algorithm, using experimental low-dose phantom, cadaver data, and low-dose cancer screen chest CT patient data to perform comparison studies. We will answer the question: When the fast and robust algorithms are used, how much can the CT dose be reduced while retaining the image quality of a standard-dose CT produced by the conventional FBP?  This R15 project provides Weber State University (WSU) computer engineering and computer science students with hands-on opportunities and experiences of performing real-world research in the field of healthcare. It will stimulate the interests of students so that they consider a career in biomedical and bioengineering field/industry. Narrative:  CT dose is currently a major concern for the general public. Low-dose CT is under development.

POCUS applications are characterized by utilizing low-cost, portable U/S systems; in the hands of novice operators; with novel data acquisition, signal processing, and machine learning methods; with imprecise trackers; and in highly unconstrained point-of-care environments, e.g.: at the scene of accidents for patient triage, in the offices of general practitioners for scoliosis detection and monitoring, in patients' homes for an aging population, as well as throughout hospitals. In these contexts, many are considering POCUS devices to be the stethoscopes of the future.  The foundation of Slicer+PLUS is the integration and extension of 3D Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. We are the developers of these libraries. We, and the users of our libraries, are proposing Slicer+PLUS so that the Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC communities can come together and cohesively address the important challenges and opportunities posed by POCUS applications. Over 30 letters of support are included with this application.  3D Slicer is a world-class, freely available open-source platform for medical image segmentation, registration, and visualization. PLUS is a world-class, open-source library for communicating with ultrasound machines and trackers (for following objects in 3D using magnetic, optical, and other technologies). MUSiiC is a (previously closed source) library that focuses on advanced ultrasound acquisition and analysis methods, such as ultrasound reconstruction pipelines, elastography, and photoacoustic imaging. Together, these toolkits have averaged over 5,100 downloads per month for the past year.  A central tenant of our work is that POCUS applications should not be viewed as simply involving the use of inexpensive, portable U/S systems; POCUS must be viewed as a new modality for it to attain its full potential. POCUS must involve innovative, automated data analysis methods and workflows that can guide a user to properly place and manipulate an ultrasound probe and interpret the returned ultrasound data. In particular, the output of those workflows and analyses should be quantitative measures, not b-mode images, since the expertise to interpret such images will not be readily available at points-of-care. To that end, the proposed work goes well beyond simple integration of Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. Multiple innovations are proposed such as Ultrasound Spectroscopy for tissue labeling, Dynamic Textures for anatomic localization of ultrasound probes, and self-tracking ultrasound probes.  To assess our progress towards our goals, our team includes our target users: researchers, medical device manufacturers, and clinical innovators dedicated to low-cost POCUS applications. They will be validating our efforts by integrating them into their research and translational POCUS product development projects. Project Narrative  Low-cost ultrasound probes have the potential to become the stethoscopes of the future and revolutionize in-field and in-hospital patient care. Our goal is to integrate, enhance, and disseminate three cutting edge ultrasound acquisition, analysis, and display toolkits to create a new framework called Slicer+PLUS that will serve as a catalyst for research and product development into low-cost point-of-care ultrasound applications. In particular, our framework will include and facilitate innovative methods for guiding a novice user in ultrasound probe placement and for automatically interpreting ultrasound data to provide a diagnosis, without the user having to interpret a traditional B-mode ultrasound image at any point in the process. The Slicer+PLUS framework will be validated using tasks associated with (a) emergency service personnel performing Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exams at the scene of an accident to detect or rule-out intra-abdominal bleeding; (b) the clinical monitoring of scoliosis progression in children in general practitioners' offices; and (c) the translation of research into regulatory-approved products based on Slicer+PLUS.","Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis",9535994,R01EB021396,"['Abdomen', 'Accidents', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blood', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intervention', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stethoscopes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'catalyst', 'clinical translation', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'elastography', 'emergency service responder', 'hospital patient care', 'image guided therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'open source', 'photoacoustic imaging', 'point of care', 'portability', 'product development', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'scoliosis', 'signal processing', 'software development', 'transmission process']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R01,2018,100000,5161939,0.008341817331784556
"Automated Diagnosis and Progression Rate of IPF Using HRCT Project Summary: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of unknown etiology occurring in older adults. IPF is ultimately fatal with a median survival of 2 to 5 years, and exhibits a highly heterogeneous natural history. Broad categories of disease progression have been defined, but are not predictable at the time of diagnosis. Diagnosis and stratification of disease phenotypes are important in order to decipher the effects of novel therapies among individuals with biologically dissimilar natural histories and to better tailor therapy to individuals. Few computerized diagnostic tools have been developed for IPF that correlate with visual and surgical lung biopsy; most use clinical and functional variables independent of imaging findings. Prognostic determinants based on imaging features rely largely on subjective visual assessment of disease. In contrast, no good predictive models with localized region exist that anticipate the natural history of disease in advance of significant functional decline. Given the indispensable role of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in the diagnosis and surveillance of IPF, we propose to mine the rich information in HRCT data sets to develop robust, quantitative features that can anticipate disease progression in advance of debilitating respiratory compromise. We propose to use as a derivative dataset the anonymized clinical data and source images on 234 patients with IPF and 266 patients with IPF suspected, but not IPF based on HRCT and the surgical biopsy who have participated in multicenter trials, and whose data are archived at the UCLA Computer Vision and Imaging Biomarkers Laboratory. Using an image processing pipeline developed in our laboratory for high through-put quantitative image analysis, we will train a classifier with features of anatomic distribution and reproducible imaging features expressed with a quantitative lung fibrosis (QLF) score, testing on separate data from in an independent institutional registry of clinical and image data on patients with IPF seen in the UCLA Interstitial Lung Disease Program. Furthermore, the second aim is to develop a rate of progression at local region and to aggregate predictive models using Cox proportional regression models, which will be derived using only clinical covariates and combined clinical and imaging covariates, correlating these models with progression free survival. Our objectives are centered on the goals of using preexisting datasets to develop clinically meaningful models that diagnose and anticipate disease course in patients with IPF and subdividing patients into more homogeneous groups prior to the development of significant respiratory impairment. We anticipate that models can be used clinically at the individual patient level to enable more informed and timely management decisions to define more homogeneous cohorts for purposes of testing new targeted therapies and to better elucidate the effects of therapies in patients with biologically heterogeneous disease progression. Relevance to Public Health: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of older adults that now has a few treatment options: The natural history of IPF and its rate of progression is highly variables, which hampers timely decisions about referral for lung transplantation or treatments using new drug therapies. This research takes advantage of clinical and imaging datasets previously collected for research or clinical purposes, and will define image features using computer analysis of computed tomography (CT) images to diagnose and predict disease course robustly in advance of respiratory deterioration. The success of this research will enable us to distinguish between patients with IPF and non-IPF with reducing chance of lung biopsy and predict slowly versus rapidly progressive disease, leading to more time to treat patients and timely management decisions, and may help us to understand which patients might benefit from novel promising therapies or treatments and which may not.",Automated Diagnosis and Progression Rate of IPF Using HRCT,9592308,R21HL140465,"['Acute', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Archives', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease stratification', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Laboratories', 'Lobar', 'Lobe', 'Lung', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Natural History', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathology', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Progressive Disease', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stable Disease', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'data archive', 'digital imaging', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'functional decline', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'pulmonary function', 'quantitative imaging', 'respiratory', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2018,113241,673201228,-0.009238579421380568
"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life. This research will also provide quantitative outcome measures that may be used in future clinical trials.",Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS,9526512,K01HD088762,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Equilibrium', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'FXTAS', 'Family', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuroepidemiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Posture', 'Predictive Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'data management', 'design', 'disability', 'disabling symptom', 'epidemiology study', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'gait examination', 'improved', 'instrument', 'male', 'men', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sex']",NICHD,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2018,129737,55098220,-0.007462296008268733
"New Approach to Quantitative Beta Amyloid Imaging Using PET Summary This project seeks to prove the commercial feasibility of a new approach to analyzing dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) data that would improve sensitivity, quantitative accuracy, and accessibility of imaging the biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent progress in understanding the nature of neurodegenerative diseases — especially evidence that the onset of cognitive symptoms of AD can be mitigated —amplify the critical need of improved quantitative evaluation of AD biomarkers. Dynamic PET may be the most accurate modality capable of achieving this goal. However, current strategies of analyzing dynamic PET images either require complex acquisition protocols with invasive arterial blood sampling procedures or rely on accuracy-degrading approximations such as compartment modeling. We have developed Intelligent Dynamics-Driven Quantitative Diagnostics (IDDQD), a novel processing approach based on factor analysis of dynamic structures with partial clustering used to initiate the process. We have shown that an early version of IDDQD can extract blood and tissue tracer dynamics and the corresponding spatial distributions from 11C-PIB PET scans. SolvingDynamics Inc plans to offer a Research-as-a-Service data processing workflow that will apply IDDQD to dynamic brain PET datasets acquired by the customers, producing accurate quantitative tracer dynamics time-activity curves (TACs) and the distribution of the targeted tissues, including the AD biomarkers beta-amyloid and tau. Our proprietary algorithm does not require the tracer dynamics model to achieve steady state, so a shorter scan can be used to generate results of similar or better accuracy than those produced by current approaches, such as reference tissue- based methods. In this proposal, SolvingDynamics seeks to prove the feasibility of our proposed approach by comparing the diagnostics obtained using IDDQD analysis of dynamic PET data and those obtained from independent measurements. A subcontract group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has been conducting dynamic 11C-PIB PET studies for several years and has accumulated over 70 cases with PET data matched to both cognitive-memory tests and to post-mortem pathology studies. SolvingDynamics will retrospectively apply its analysis technique to these datasets and compare its computed tissue distributions to standardized uptake volume ratio (SUVR) and distribution volume ratio (DVR) data. A subset of 20 dynamic 11C-PIB PET datasets ranging in length from 15 to 90 minutes will also be analyzed in order to validate the feasibility of reducing the imaging time. In addition, similar studies aimed at reducing imaging time with IDDQD will be performed for 20 PET scans acquired using 18F-AV1451 tracer to image tau. PROJECT NARRATIVE Positron emission tomography image analysis methodology to be validated in this project aims to improve sensitivity and specificity of tissue analysis in dynamic positron emission tomography, improving diagnosis of Alzheimer's diseases and other neurodegenerative disorders. The main benefits are expected in medical research developing treatments for dementia and in clinical diagnosis, allowing early detection of the disease with less cost and reduced radiation dose to the patients.",New Approach to Quantitative Beta Amyloid Imaging Using PET,9557192,R43AG059500,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Autopsy', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Factor Analysis', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Injections', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'amyloid imaging', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'heuristics', 'human subject', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'molecular imaging', 'neuropathology', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiotracer', 'tau Proteins', 'uptake']",NIA,"SOLVINGDYNAMICS, INC.",R43,2018,149871,0,-0.07456261372431519
"Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD ABSTRACT The goal of this NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to provide an organized scientific and educational environment for Dr. Timothy Kline to begin his transition into an independent research career focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. This proposal outlines a five-year training plan at Mayo Clinic under the primary mentorship of Dr. Bradley Erickson and a Mentoring Team comprised of accomplished researchers in the fields of: biology, nephrology, genetics, radiology, informatics; medical physics, biostatistics, image processing, and physiology. The focus of this proposal is to improve both research studies and disease prognosis for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients through biomedical imaging techniques. It is well understood that imaging is essential for ADPKD diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome prediction. Clinical studies utilize total kidney volume (TKV) (as measured by MRI as an image-based biomarker) to follow the progression of ADPKD, as larger TKVs have been shown to correlate with worse prognosis in both human and animal-model studies. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming, costly, and poorly standardized. The introduction of automated approaches for measuring TKV will: greatly improve measurement throughput, significantly reduce costs associated with performing research studies, allow accurate and reproducible measurements to be obtained both within and across institutions; facilitate the search for new imaging biomarkers. The specific aims of this project are to: (i) develop and validate automated tools to characterize renal structure, such as TKV and cystic burden; (ii) explore new imaging biomarkers by image texture feature analysis and pattern recognition techniques; and (iii) develop a new technique to measure renal blood flow. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic's outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Mayo Clinic Translational PKD Center, which focuses on translating basic science research into improvements in the management and treatment of ADPKD patients. Dr. Kline's background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, Dr. Kline will: 1) develop a strong knowledge base in both nephrology and radiology by attending relevant rounds, seminars, and national conferences; 2) enhance his knowledge of medical imaging, biology, physiology, genetics, and programming through coursework and mentoring; 3) attend workshops focused on grant and publication writing; and 4) submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of new imaging biomarkers of ADPKD. Obtaining this K Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline's transition into a prosperous independent research career. Narrative Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders and is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Total kidney volume (TKV) has become the main image-based biomarker for following ADPKD progression. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming and costly.

"HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research DESCRIPTION:   My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator who harnesses biomedical Big Data Science for the investigation of multilevel influences on health. To continue my progress towards this goal, I am proposing to build the infrastructure to establish a neighborhood data repository, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers and policy makers. I am a highly trained researcher in social epidemiology and quantitative analyses, particularly large health surveys. Before coming to Utah, I worked as a full-time statistical programmer/data analyst on a NIH-funded project to evaluate the health effects of a large neighborhood relocation policy experiment on low-income families in five cities. Our study results suggested that moving from high- to lower poverty neighborhood is related to reductions in obesity and diabetes and improved mental health. Other extant research has provided evidence on associations between the neighborhood environment and mortality and morbidity-even after adjusting for individual characteristics. Poor access to healthy food, fast food chains, the lack of recreational facilities, and higher crime rates all correlate with hiher obesity rates. Nonetheless, the dearth of neighborhood data, especially measures of neighborhood quality that are consistent across geographic areas, limits neighborhood effects research. Moreover, neighborhoods are not only defined by their resources, but also by the social interactions and activities of people who live there. The widespread usage of the internet and open recording of many transactions has led to the availability of massive amounts of data that permits capture of previously hidden micro-level interactions. We will build the data algorithms and infrastructure to harness relatively untapped, cost efficient, and pervasive social media data to develop neighborhood indicators such as food themes, healthiness of food mentions, frequency of exercise/recreation mentions, metabolic intensity of physical activities, and happiness levels. The creation of HashtagHealth requires the use and refinement of Big Data methods to perform data mining, processing and storing of heterogeneous, unstructured data. We will build a testable version of HashtagHealth for the state of Utah and then apply the data resource to the examination of neighborhood effects on young adult obesity. My rigorous training and previous research experiences in social determinants of health, causal inference, and data analyses uniquely prepare me to make significant contributions to the field of Big Data, particularly at the intersection of public health and social sciences.  My Specific Aims are: 1) to develop a neighborhood data resource, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers, 2) to develop Big Data techniques to produce novel neighborhood quality indicators (e.g., healthiness of food mentions, frequency and type of exercise/recreation and happiness levels), and 3) to utilize HashtagHealth and individual-level data from the Utah Population Database to investigate neighborhood influences on obesity among young adults. My mentorship team includes experts in biomedical research (Drs. Ken Smith, Jim VanDerslice), computer science (Dr. Feifei Li), and statistics (Dr. Ming Wen). My team has the breadth of expertise to help me obtain critical multidisciplinary skills and successfully implement my research aims. In addition to my research aims, my Specific Career Development Aims include the following: 1) to develop expertise in data mining and database systems, 2) to acquire training in natural language processing and machine learning, 3) to further gain knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), 4) to develop expertise in study design and analysis of neighborhood effects, and 5) and to develop grant writing and research management skills to lead future projects. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to successfully compete for R01 funding to create a national neighborhood data repository and to investigate national patterns of neighborhood effects on obesity. This proposal makes significant, relevant contributions to the field because 1) neighborhood environments are increasingly linked to important health outcomes, and 2) this project addresses the limits to research resulting from the lack of neighborhood data by providing new, cost-efficient data resources and methods for characterizing neighborhoods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic rise in obesity and related chronic diseases in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. My overarching career goal is to contribute to the improvement of population health by conducting research in social determinants of health and developing new methodologies to address multidimensional research questions. The development of the Hashtag Health data repository will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of social media data to capture social and cultural processes with potential impact on health.",HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research,9521378,K01ES025433,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Communications Media', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Food Chain', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Politics', 'Population Database', 'Poverty', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'adult obesity', 'big biomedical data', 'built environment', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fast food', 'food consumption', 'health data', 'improved', 'lower income families', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'news', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'social media', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'walkability', 'young adult']",NIEHS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",K01,2018,155914,58406802,-0.004051781545304218
"MRI near Total Joint replacements Project Abstract Overview: The parent project for this supplement aims to provide routine MRI of subjects with total joint replacements by reducing the severe image artifacts near metal, while offering highly efficient patient-specific scans that can detect bone loss, infection, and temperature changes near the implant in clinically feasible scan times. The supplement aims to incorporate deep learning techniques to better meet the parent grant goals. Relevance: Total joint replacements are one of the most successful orthopedic procedures, used annually to reduce pain from joint diseases in about one million patients in the United States (a number projected to double by 2030). However, about 10% of joint replacements fail in 5-10 years due to bone loss (osteolysis), infection, or other complications, often leading to revision surgery. Accurate, early, non-invasive assessment of complications remains limited, but would offer earlier and less invasive treatments, reduce unnecessary surgery, or allow better surgical planning. Approach: Prior to, and during the parent grant period, we have developed novel “multi-spectral imaging” (MSI) MRI techniques that allow visualization of pathology adjacent to metallic implants, and together with other groups have successfully applied them to imaging of patients with devices including joint replacements and spinal fixation hardware. However these methods remain slow, have limited spatial resolution, and are challenging to use routinely. The recent growth of the machine learning field including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and its application to medical imaging offers unique opportunities to substantially improve MRI near metal, and specifically the goals of the parent grant. We propose 3 small, independent aims in the supplement: (1) to bring fast, isotropic imaging near metal to clinical practice by using CNN-based methods to reduce reconstruction times to under 30 seconds, (2) to improve image quality away from metal by using a new reconstruction and CNN to avoid needing standard imaging in addition to MSI methods and (3) to reduce background-gradient induced artifacts near to metal using a CNN-based approach to enable better diagnosis of abnormalities adjacent to metal. Summary: We aim to supplement our parent grant with CNN-based approaches to speed up scanning and image reconstruction, and to improve image quality near to and way from metal. These techniques will allow routine, non-invasive evaluation for earlier and more accurate detection and treatment of complications in these patients, as well as numerous other applications of MRI near metal implants. Project Narrative There is a growing need for accurate diagnosis of complications surrounding joint arthroplasty, where MRI would provide excellent contrast if not for the fact that the presence of metal severely degrades images. Building on recent ideas in MRI and deep learning, we propose to develop practical methods for routine clinical imaging of patients with metal implants by increasing speed as well as offering image contrast that shows infection and other complications near the metal devices. Ultimately these methods will be tested and offered for widespread use to enable earlier and better treatment of complications resulting from arthroplasty, as well as for better understanding of the implications of different devices.",MRI near Total Joint replacements,9750463,R01EB017739,"['Address', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Direct Costs', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Infection', 'Joint repair', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Network-based', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Procedures', 'Osteolysis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Protocols documentation', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Stretching', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'arthropathies', 'bone loss', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'cluster computing', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'field study', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'metallicity', 'novel', 'pain reduction', 'parent grant', 'parent project', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'spectrograph']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,156870,560644462,-0.0005458138645806445
"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs. The proposed novel approaches are expected to advance precision medicine approaches to SUDs by enabling treatment matching and a more refined SUD classification to gene finding.",Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data,9427988,K02DA043063,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurobiology', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol use disorder', 'biomarker performance', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cocaine use', 'contingency management', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'genetic association', 'genomic data', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'opioid use disorder', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,K02,2018,162800,36067938,-0.035659782620202654
"Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During medical imaging, patient motion is virtually unavoidable presenting a significant source of image degradation and artifacts, which in turn, can impact the quality of care received by many patients. One method used to address patient motion is to employ visual tracking systems (VTS), which involves placing a small number of reflective markers on the patient that can be located and tracked in 3D space using stereo cameras. The tracked markers can then be used as a surrogate to a structure of interest, such as the heart. The tracked surrogate provides a quantifiable measure that can be directly correlated with the motion of the target structure, which can then be used for prospective or retrospective motion correction. However, the markers add complexity to patient workflow, provide only a sparse sampling of the patient's surface, and the optimal number and placement of markers is unknown. This project addresses the shortcomings of marker-based VTS systems by proposing to develop and test a novel low-cost marker-less VTS system for tracking patient motion within a hybrid imaging system. The primary barrier for successfully tracking the patient's body surface using marker-less VTS is that clothing prevents an unobstructed view of the patient's body. The candidate, Dr. Lindsay, is proposing to incorporate a translational method using computational approaches to compensate for garments within the proposed marker-less VTS system. Dr. Lindsay has received training in computer science and computer vision and previously has focused on the computational aspects of capturing, modeling, and rendering of physical phenomena such as light and is proposing to extend this knowledge to the medical imaging field. Dr. Lindsay's goals for this proposal are to acquire the necessary training and skills that will allow him to translate his expertise and existing computational skills to an area f research with medical relevance: namely, detecting and tracking patient motion for the purpose of improving motion correction for hybrid- imaging. Dr. Lindsay's long-term career goal is to become an accomplished independent investigator focusing on solving significant problems in medical imaging by translating advances in Computer Science. The proposed work will take place the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (UMass) in Worcester, MA under the primary mentorship of Dr. Michael King, an internationally known expert in the area of medical imaging and medical physics in Nuclear Medicine. Drs. Gennert, Sullivan, Licho have expertise in computer vision, mechanical engineering and medical imaging, and radiology and Nuclear Medicine, respectively will also serve as co-mentors.  The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) develop a novel marker-less VTS, which we call PT- Cam, using low-cost using state-of-the-art camera technology, 2) model surface motion as a surrogate for internal motion of the heart, and 3) conduct tests of the PT-Cam system, in order to determine the acceptability and feasibility of clinical usage, on patients undergoing clinical MPI PET/CT imaging. Thus, the main objective of this program of research is to develop a clinically viable method for motion tracking patients undergoing hybrid-imaging studies by using a novel marker-less surface-tracking method that can compensate for clothing and provide modeling of interior motion of structures from surface tracking. If successful, not only will this project provide an innovative, marker-less VTS system for low-cost surface tracking for motion compensation during hybrid imaging but it will also give the candidate the necessary training needed to become an independent investigator in the medical field and potentially a leader in the field of medical imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 7.2 million people per year die world-wide from coronary artery disease (CAD), and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become a critical tool for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment of CAD. During medical imaging such as MPI, patient motion is virtually unavoidable and presents a significant source of image degradation and it has been suggested that upwards of 40% of cardiac studies in PET are effected by some type of motion with similar findings for SPECT. The proposed project will directly address the shortcomings of previous methods for tracking patient motion by developing and testing a novel low-cost marker-less visual tracking system for patient motion within hybrid imaging.",Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging,9517057,K25EB019032,"['Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Body Surface', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clothing', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Optics', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Security', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'heart motion', 'imaging study', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'perfusion imaging', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'skills', 'success', 'validation studies', 'virtual', 'visual tracking', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K25,2018,169609,294146927,0.007073570161482853
"The Role of the Microbiome in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K23 proposal will complete Robert Dickson, MD's training towards his long-term career goal of improving our understanding and treatment of lung disease by investigation of the microbiome. Dr. Dickson is a Pulmonary and Critical Care physician and scientist at the University of Michigan with established success in the burgeoning field of lung microbiome studies. This proposal builds on Dr. Dickson's previously acquired expertise in pulmonary pathophysiology and microbial ecology with new training in clinical research methods and computational biology. These established and newly-acquired skills will be integrated to improve our understanding of the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). This research will be conducted under the guidance of primary mentor Gary B. Huffnagle PhD, co- mentor Theodore J. Standiford MD and an advisory board of accomplished investigators with expertise in clinical research methods, computational biology and lung immunology as well as extensive mentoring success. This 5-year plan includes formal coursework, professional development, and progressively independent research, with defined milestones to ensure productivity and a successful transition to independence. The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expense, responsible for an estimated 74,500 U.S. deaths per year. Numerous studies have identified indirect evidence of translocation of bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the lung in patients at risk for ARDS, but to date no study has evaluated the role of microbiome in the pathogenesis of ARDS. This proposal will test the hypothesis that translocation of gut bacteria to the lung provokes the inflammation and injury of ARDS via two specific Scientific Aims. Aim 1 will determine if translocation of enteric bacteria to the lung microbiome precedes the clinical development of ARDS, and Aim 2 will determine the temporal relationship between respiratory dysbiosis, host inflammation and the clinical onset of ARDS. Inherent to completing these high-level aims, Dr. Dickson will execute a prospective cohort study of patients at high risk for ARDS, utilize modern culture-independent techniques of bacterial identification to describe the bacterial communities in the lungs and gastrointestinal tracts of high-risk patients, and apply novel techniques of advanced computational modeling to the complex nonlinear system of ARDS pathogenesis. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: 1) to determine if the lung microbiome contributes to disease progression among patients with established ARDS and 2) to determine if the lung microbiome can be therapeutically manipulated in critically ill patients to prevent or modulate respiratory disease. n addition to building a foundation for a programmatic line of research to understand the role of the microbiome in lung disease, this proposal will provide Dr. Dickson with research skills applicable to additional domains of human microbiome and ARDS research. This K23 award will equip Dr. Dickson to establish himself as an independent investigator and international leader in this promising field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expense, responsible for an estimated 74,500 U.S. deaths per year; the National Institutes of Health have identified the prevention and early treatment of ARDS as a research priority. We lack an understanding of the pathogenesis of ARDS, impeding our ability to predict and prevent its onset. Determination of the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of ARDS would both 1) improve our ability to predict the onset of ARDS, enabling targeted preventive interventions and 2) identify novel therapeutic targets at the microbiome/host interface in patients at risk for ARDS.",The Role of the Microbiome in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,9413355,K23HL130641,"['Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Alveolar', 'Bacteria', 'Catecholamines', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Culture-independent methods', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early treatment', 'Ecology', 'Ensure', 'Enterobacter', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Epinephrine', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gammaproteobacteria', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immigration', 'Immunology', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Non-linear Models', 'Norepinephrine', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Pseudomonas', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'bacterial community', 'bacteriome', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical development', 'clinical risk', 'cytokine', 'dysbiosis', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal bacteria', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'host microbiome', 'improved', 'indexing', 'lung microbiome', 'lung microbiota', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'mortality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'respiratory microbiome', 'skills', 'spatiotemporal', 'success']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2018,171176,641965656,0.006429732484210478
"Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Michael Mathis is a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist with board certification in anesthesiology and advanced perioperative echocardiography at the University of Michigan. Through completion of a T32 Research Training Grant, Dr. Mathis has developed expertise in perioperative outcomes research for patients with advanced cardiovascular disease. His long-term career goal is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF) through harnessing perioperative electronic healthcare record (EHR) data for early diagnosis and management. This proposal builds on Dr. Mathis's expertise, providing protected time for training in data science methods necessary to drive forward the analytic techniques proposed for improving HF diagnosis. Environment: The University of Michigan is the coordinating center for the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG), an international consortium of over 50 anesthesiology and surgical departments with perioperative information systems. Dr. Sachin Kheterpal, MD, MBA is the primary mentor for Dr. Mathis, and is the Director for MPOG and member of the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative Advisory Panel. The proposed research will be completed under the guidance of Dr. Kheterpal, as well as co-mentors Milo Engoren, MD, Daniel Clauw, MD, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD. An advisory panel of experts in HF diagnosis and data science methodologies will provide Dr. Mathis with additional guidance. Background: HF is among the most common chronic conditions requiring hospitalization and carries high rates of mortality. In the perioperative period, HF is a risk factor for major cardiac complications. Despite advances in care, little progress has been made to reduce HF healthcare burden, with difficulties attributable to a lack of inexpensive, reliable diagnostic measures. Consequently, patients with HF can go unrecognized in early stages and do not receive treatments to reduce mortality. The perioperative period is an underutilized opportunity to improve HF diagnosis. Beyond the wealth of preoperative data available, the intraoperative period serves as a cardiac stress test through which hemodynamic responses to surgical and anesthetic stimuli are recorded with high resolution. Yet, this data remains an untapped resource for HF evaluation. Research: The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate the perioperative period as an opportunity for early diagnosis of HF. The two specific Aims are to develop a data-driven diagnostic algorithm for HF using preoperative EHR data (Aim 1) as well as intraoperative EHR data (Aim 2). Both aims will use automated techniques to extract features of HF from the perioperative EHR, developed at UM and scalable to multiple centers via the MPOG infrastructure. This work represents a paradigm shift in perioperative evaluation, using perioperative data as a diagnostic tool rather than a risk-assessment tool. The proposed research and training will provide Dr. Mathis with necessary data science computational experience to become an independent physician-investigator focused on improving perioperative management strategies for patients with HF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Public Health Relevance Statement: Heart failure is a common chronic condition affecting over 550,000 patients each year, with a 45–60% mortality rate at 5 years. Despite advances in treatment, little progress has been made to improve heart failure diagnosis, and thus patients in early heart failure stages do not receive appropriate life-extending therapies. Through robust data science methodologies, this study harnesses critically underutilized, high-fidelity data available during the perioperative period to improve diagnosis of heart failure .",Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach,9504767,K01HL141701,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Assessment tool', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Blood Pressure', 'Board Certification', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Science', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'International', 'Intraoperative Period', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methodological Studies', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'care providers', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stressor', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2018,172141,641965656,-0.010036955932585127
"Improving cancer family history collection through social networking and artificial intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY  The  activities  proposed  in  this  NCI  K07  application  are  designed  to  advance  the  career  development  and  research  independence  of  Dr.  Brandon  M.  Welch.  Family  health  history  (FHx)  is  one  of  the most important  resources available to help clinicians identify disease risks. By knowing a patient's FHx, clinicians can quickly  identify  disease risks and initiate risk-reducing strategies such as increased screening, prophylactic surgery,  risk-reducing  therapeutics,  and  lifestyle  changes.  FHx  is  also  the  foundation  of  genomic  medicine.  Unfortunately,  the  collection  and  use  of  FHx  by  patients  and  clinicians  is  suboptimal.  To  improve  the  collection and use of FHx among the general population, a better FHx tool that is easier and more convenient  to  use  than  current  FHx  tools  is  needed.  A  new  FHx  web  tool,  called  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com,​  incorporates  artificial intelligence and social networking to improve user engagement with FHx collection.Utilizing artificial  intelligence  based  chat  entity  can  improve  the  collection  of  FHx  information  by  making  it  easier  and  more  engaging to record FHx information, likewise social networking allows users to tap into the collective wisdom  and  knowledge  of  the  family  to  correct  inaccuracies  and  overcome  gaps  in  FHx  knowledge.  This research  study  will  first  identify  enhancements  to  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com  ​that  will  further  promote  user  engagement,  with  particular  focus  on  rural and underserved patients (Aim 1). We will then evaluate whether this new FHx  tool can improve collection of cancer FHx in comparison with current FHx tools (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess  the impact of ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com ​on the clinical settings (Aim 3). To implement the research plan, it will be  critical  to  apply,  skills  obtained  through  K  award  learning  objectives,  namely  clinical  oncology  (learning  objective  1),  iterative  patient-centered  design  (learning  objective  2),  and  health  technology  assessment  (learning  objective  3).  To  fulfill  these  learning  objectives,  an  interdisciplinary  group  of  mentors  will  direct  a  comprehensive training plan. The training plan includes coursework, seminars, workshops, journal clubs, and  conferences,  covering clinical oncology, patient engagement, health disparities, user-centered development,  human-computer  interaction,  clinical  research  methodologies,  health  technology  assessment,  and  ethical  conduct  of  research.  The  strong  support  of  an  excellent  team  of  mentors,  and  the  vast  resources  of  the  Medical  University  of  South  Carolina,  create  an  optimal  training  environment.  Collectively,  the  integrated  learning  objectives  and  research  plan  are  critical  to  establishing  a  successful,  innovative,  and  meaningful  academic career focused on developing patient-centric informatics tools for oncology.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Family health history (FHx) is one of the most important risk factors for cancer and the foundation of genomic medicine, but is under-utilized by patients and clinicians.

"New Approach to US Elasticity Imaging Project Summary To more fully exploit the basic science of mechanobiology as it pertains to breast cancer progression, the medical imaging field continues to search for fast, safe, and effective elasticity imaging methods. In this project we propose a fundamentally new approach to ultrasonic elasticity imaging in which the weak forces applied to patient tissues and the measured displacements that result are used to train a numerical model specifically for that patient. This constitutive model is developed using finite-element methods and neural networks assembled in a unique configuration called the AutoProgressive (AutoP) Method. AutoP “learns” complete stress and strain properties directly from sparse force and displacement measurements and without a mathematical model. Using quasi-static stimuli, AutoP exploits the fact that each force-displacement estimate contains information about mechanical properties at all locations in the contiguous tissue. From measurement information and conservation laws, AutoP generates an informational model without the need to make assumptions about tissue linearity, isotropy, or other material properties normally required when constructing images that display tissue mechanical properties. Once an accurate material-property model is formed by AutoP, we adopt a separate rheological model (e.g., Kelvin Voigt) to form viscoelastic parameters for image display. The AutoP method employs beamformed RF-echo acquisitions from which point displacements are estimated, applied compressional force sensed at the transducer surface, and tissue shape.  No other imaging method is capable of estimating all relevant stress fields, which gives AutoP unique capabilities. AutoP estimates the mechanical properties that one strives to obtain from an inverse problem approach, but AutoP is not a mathematical inverse technique and hence does not suffer from nonunique solutions. Without the need to assume material properties, AutoP can (in principle) model tissue properties in three dimensions and in time following large deformations in highly-nonlinear, anisotropic media. This R21 proposal focuses on establishing the feasibility of the AutoP methodology for subsequent clinical trials under future funding. At the completion of this two-year project, we will demonstrate a new tool for medical imaging capable of exploring the mechanical properties of tissues over a very broad range of deformations. We specifically target ultrasonic methods and quasi-static force stimuli in this project. However AutoP could eventually be coupled to other imaging modalities (e.g., MRE, OCE) or dynamic force-stimulus methods.  The scientific premise underlying AutoP is that we already record all of the information needed to generate a very broad range of elasticity images. The key to unlocking this information is to set aside mathematical models in favor of data-driven informational models built using the unique machine learning abilities of the AutoP method. If successful, AutoP will have a major influence on medical elasticity imaging methods. Project Narrative: A new type of machine-learning method is proposed for elasticity imaging of patient tissues that offers the potential to minimize many current limitations. If we are successful in this development, ultrasonic elasticity imaging would significantly improve in its ability to accurately represent mechanical properties of breast tissues, without any changes in current instrumentation and without increasing cost to the healthcare system or adding risk to patients.",New Approach to US Elasticity Imaging,9560761,R21EB023402,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Breast', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elasticity', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Isotropy', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modulus', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Ultrasonics', 'Writing', 'aged', 'base', 'breast cancer progression', 'breast imaging', 'cost', 'experience', 'healthy volunteer', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'imaging properties', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'mechanical properties', 'model building', 'model development', 'novel strategies', 'object shape', 'processing speed', 'sensor technology', 'tool', 'viscoelasticity']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2018,179876,76545728,-0.029178888517695855
"Leveraging modern analytic approaches to improve diabetes outcomes ABSTRACT Diabetic patients are at risk of developing diabetic heart disease, which may lead to complications in care. Diabetic heart disease patients not only have exceptionally high healthcare expenditures and resource utilization but also are likely to have poor patient outcomes. Studies have shown that early intervention of patients likely to develop diabetic heart disease is cost-effective and yields favorable health outcomes. Therefore, early identiﬁcation of diabetic patients at high-risk of developing diabetic heart disease is crucial to provide effective interventions. The commonly accepted methodology for diabetic heart disease risk prediction is the use of one or more risk scoring systems. However, these risk functions may not generalize well for the diabetes patient and may suffer from poor calibration when used on different cohorts. Moreover, the scoring systems have only been studied on coronary heart disease, one variant of diabetic heart disease while heart failure and diabetic cardiomyopathy remain important, yet insufﬁciently studied problems. Machine learning offers the ability to perform accurate predictive analytics and has been proposed as a way to identify and manage high-risk patients. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a high-impact and practical risk prediction model that can be used to per- form early identiﬁcation of high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. Given the heterogeneity and complexity of patient information in electronic health records, the model needs to capitalize on the multi-dimensional temporal nature of pa- tient records to extract identifying characteristics of patients that will develop diabetic heart disease. To accomplish this, we will leverage modern machine learning approaches such as tensor factorization and natural language processing to model complex patient characteristics, provide a more complete representation of the patient, and uncover excellent predictors of diabetic heart disease risk. An existing dataset that contains the de-identiﬁed electronic health records of approximately 4,100 diabetic patients from the Emory Healthcare System to compare the predictive power of machine learning-based algorithms with the standard risk scoring systems. These algorithms will be evaluated on calibration, discrimination, and ease of interpretability. The results of this work will provide insight as to how to develop a machine learning–based prediction system that can identify high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. The study may also shed light on the best approaches for fusing data from multiple heterogeneous sources to build a better predictive model and potentially identify novel indicators of high- risk diabetic heart disease factors. Moreover, the work will help inform a larger multi-site study of diabetic heart disease risk prediction and develop methods to generalize the results to a broader spectrum of comorbidities. This project is consistent with the National Library of Medicine's mission to translate biomedical research into practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetic patients are risk of developing diabetic heart disease which can lead to high healthcare expenditure, high resource utilization, and poor patient outcomes. Existing diabetic risk prediction models can suffer from poor calibration and predictive accuracy.

"Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI Project Summary/Abstract Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) provides arguably the most comprehensive evaluation of the cardiovascular system; however, respiratory motion continues to adversely impact CMR, causing artifacts that lead to poor image quality, repeated scans, and decreased throughput, and thus represents a significant obstacle to clinical utility. For single-shot CMR, cardiac and breathing motions are “frozen” by limiting the acquisition to an end-diastolic window less than 200 ms. For first pass perfusion, breathing motion cannot be eliminated because data from 50 to 60 consecutive heartbeats are required to capture contrast dynamics. For other single-shot applications such as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and parameter mapping, respiratory motion is introduced when the acquisition is repeated across several heartbeats to improve spatial and temporal resolution. To eliminate respiratory motion from single-shot images, non-rigid motion correction (MOCO) has been promoted as an attractive option that provides 100% acquisition efficiently. MOCO can be used either after the reconstruction or during the reconstruction. Such techniques, however, cannot account for through-plane motion, which can only be corrected prospectively, and can fail depending on image quality and the extent of motion. Prospective compensation of the respiratory motion has been recognized as an attractive alternative to existing gating and MOCO methods. Proposed methods use one or more navigator echoes—incompatible with or inefficient for many CMR protocols—to capture the respiratory motion and rely on simple parametric models that are inadequate to describe complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion. Due to these limitations, prospective methods have found limited applicability even in research settings. We propose a new framework to prospectively compensate respiratory motion. The proposed method, called PROspective Motion compensation using Pilot Tone (PROMPT), employs Pilot Tone technology and leverages machine learning principles to first learn complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion on a patient-specific basis and then prospectively compensate the motion by tracking the imaging plane, in real time, as a function of a Pilot Tone based respiratory signal. If successful, this synergistic combination of Pilot Tone and machine learning will lead to 100% efficiency for single-shot CMR exams performed under free-breathing conditions, will eliminate the need to setup navigator echoes, respiratory bellows, or other inefficient prospective gating measures, will minimize through-plane motion that can render the images non-diagnostic for CMR applications including fast-pass perfusion, parameter mapping, LGE, and coronary angiography, will provide a reliable surrogate measure of respiratory motion, and will facilitate highly accelerated compressive recovery. Project Narrative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has many potential advantages over currently used imaging methods to diagnose heart disease, but MRI images can be ruined if the patient breathes during the scan. In this project, we will develop a method that is insensitive to breathing motion and compare it to existing methods. These efforts should lead to significant improvements in diagnosis of heart disease so that patients may benefit from appropriate treatment.",Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI,9587091,R21EB026657,"['Anatomy', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Freezing', 'Gadolinium', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'healthy volunteer', 'heart motion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,185264,241268189,0.012643845922877716
"Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis Abstract This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Danhong Wang, a physician-scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Wang is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient- oriented neuroimaging research on psychiatric disorders. This K01 award will provide Dr. Wang with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in patient-oriented research in psychiatric neuroimaging; (2) to conduct experimental investigations of neurobiological correlates in patients with psychosis; (3) to implement revolutionary individual-level functional mapping techniques in clinical studies; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wang has assembled a mentoring team comprised of three mentors: Dr. Dost Öngür, Chief of the McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division, who leads a neuroimaging laboratory studying the biology of psychotic illness; Dr. Randy Buckner, Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Harvard University and Director of Psychiatric Neuroimaging at Massachusetts General Hospital, one of the pioneers in functional MRI research; and Dr. Suzanne Haber, Professor of Pharmacology and Physiology at the University of Rochester, a leading scientist in the field of neuroanatomy. In addition, Dr. Hesheng Liu, Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and a computational neuroscientist with expertise in functional imaging, will collaborate on this project. Dr. Wang will engage in multiple career development activities to expand her ability to develop mechanistic insights about psychiatric disorders. These include new training in patient-oriented experimental research, a better understanding of the psychopathology of psychosis, and a stronger grasp of neuroanatomy. She will also receive advanced training in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Determining the disconnected neural circuits underlying psychosis has proved elusive. Dr. Wang's research project aims to reveal circuitry abnormalities in psychotic patients using a subject-specific, cross-diagnostic approach. In Aim 1, Dr. Wang will establish methods for accurately characterizing the cortical and subcortical functional connectivity networks in individual patients. In Aim 2, leveraging a cross-diagnostic cohort of psychotic patients that will be scanned using the protocol optimized for individual-level functional analyses, as well as an existing patient data set, Dr. Wang will identify and validate cortical and subcortical functional connectivity abnormalities related to the severity of psychotic symptoms. In Aim 3, Dr. Wang will investigate the temporal variations of connectivity in individual patients and reveal abnormalities in dynamic functional connectivity related to symptoms. A series of preliminary studies conducted by Dr. Wang have laid the solid foundation for each specific aim. This research will form the basis of a study for identifying the “connectivity hubs” in individual patients for potential modulation, to be proposed in an R01 grant application before the end of the K award. Narrative (no more than 250 characters): The goal of the proposed project is to develop reliable functional estimates at the single- subject level to reveal abnormalities in both static and dynamic functional connectivity relevant to psychosis. !",Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis,9530687,K01MH111802,"['Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Portraits', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychology', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Solid', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cortex mapping', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'grasp', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'mid-career faculty', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'professor', 'psychotic symptoms', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2018,186155,551214295,-0.006835912283312468
"Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD Project Summary Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. To date, researchers have attempted to use standard machine learning methodology to identify more meaningful subtypes of COPD, but these methods often make general assumptions about the data, limiting their ability to penetrate more complex patterns in some data sets. Thus, a meaningful reclassification of COPD subtypes that could lead to more targeted therapies and interventions has been elusive. The applicant introduces a new way of looking at the COPD subtyping problem by recasting it in terms of discovering associations of individuals to disease trajectories – i.e., grouping individuals based on their similarity in response to environmental and/or disease causing variables. The machine learning methods proposed build on the most recent advances in Bayesian nonparametrics, a collection of theoretical ideas and techniques that permit very flexible data representations. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that these machine learning methods and extensions thereof – together with data sources not previously leveraged for COPD subtyping – will produce more biologically meaningful sub-groupings of patients, leading to a better understanding of the genetic and biological underpinnings of the disease and ultimately improved patient management. Aim 1 of this application involves evaluating the utility of CT-assessed lung mass – a potentially more discriminative measure of emphysema than conventionally used measures – for defining COPD subtypes using both K-means clustering and our disease trajectory algorithm. The goal of Aim 2 is to evaluate the utility of comorbidity data for defining COPD subtypes using our trajectory clustering algorithm. Novel computed tomography based measures of muscle wasting (cachexia) and pulmonary vascular pruning will be explored to determine their efficacy in subtype determination. Additionally, we will extend and test the trajectory algorithm in order to model discrete outputs (such as physician-diagnosed comorbidities), count data (e.g. exacerbations), and time-to-event data (death). In Aim 3, the applicant will extend our trajectory clustering algorithms to directly incorporate genetic and omics data for subtype discovery. Together, the research proposed in the aims of this award will take full advantage of the comprehensive data set available through the COPDGene study. Execution of the aims in this proposal will be possible through active collaboration with Dr. Ron Kikinis, M.D., a renowned leader in the field of medical image analysis, and Dr. Ed Silverman, an internationally recognized expert in the genetic epidemiology of COPD. Project Narrative Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care.

"Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is notoriously difficult to diagnose non-invasively, and current methods of assessing CMD utilize only the peak velocity of the coronary flow pattern. While new imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved the assessment coronary perfusion, there are currently no non-invasive methods that incorporate the coronary flow pattern over a complete cardiac cycle to definitively assess and predict the development of CMD.  Coronary blood flow (CBF) reflects the summation of flow in the coronary microcirculation, and our lab has begun to harness the full CBF pattern under varying flow and disease conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes) to determine whether it might harbor novel clues leading to the early detection of CMD. Our past and preliminary data indicate an early onset of CMD in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that occurs prior to the onset of macrovascular complications and that are characterized by blood flow impairments and alterations in coronary resistance microvessel (CRM) structure, function, and biomechanics. Our data also uncovered innovative correlations between CRM structure/biomechanics and our newly-defined features of the coronary flow pattern, some of which were unique to normal or diabetic mice. We have initially utilized these CBF features, in the presence and absence of other factors such as cardiac function, to develop a mathematical model in collaboration with Drs. Christopher Bartlett and William Ray that to date demonstrated that 6 simple factors can predict a normal vs. diabetic coronary flow pattern with 85% predictive accuracy. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the leading cause of heart disease and is associated with hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMD) is comprised of structural and functional deficits of the tiny coronary arteries that may be an earlier indicator of disease prior to the onset of overt CAD. The proposed multidisciplinary research aims to develop a computational artificial intelligence model that will accurately predict CMD based on a non-invasive coronary flow pattern obtained by Doppler echocardiography.",Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease,9584176,R21EB026518,"['Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic mouse', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doppler Echocardiography', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elements', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperemia', 'Hypertension', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Publications', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'coronary perfusion', 'db/db mouse', 'diabetic', 'disorder prevention', 'early onset', 'experimental study', 'heart function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'macrovascular disease', 'mathematical model', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent']",NIBIB,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R21,2018,190000,43994644,-0.007884959844605605
"MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy parkinsonian type (MSA-P), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are costly and devastating neurodegenerative diseases. They have overlapping clinical manifestations and diagnosis remains challenging in many cases. Thus far no effective treatments have been developed to meaningfully slow or stop their progression. This is due in part to a lack of tools to objectively measure degeneration in the neural systems affected by each of these diseases. Availability of such tools would assist clinical diagnosis, facilitate selection of appropriate patient groups for trial recruitment, and enable objective measurement of treatment outcomes. Recent MRI studies suggest that disease-specific brain changes can, indeed, be identified in these parkinsonian diseases. The objective of this research is to identify univariable markers and multivariable MRI signatures that capture distinct patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to accurately distinguish these diseases.  To accomplish this the investigators use 3 Tesla MRI contrasts sensitive to key features of neurodegeneration to 1) identify structures damaged by PD, MSA-P and PSP and 2) to quantify the extent of damage in each neural system in parkinsonian diseases. Specifically, the investigators use neuromelanin- sensitive MRI to measure neuromelanin loss and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and R2* imaging to measure iron accumulation in patients with PD, MSA-P, and PSP. Using these contrasts and an innovative region of interest (ROI) selection approach, they reproducibly measure patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems. In Aim 1 the investigators use neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to study neuromelanin loss in PD, MSA-P and PSP in to identify univariable disease features that are differentially affected by parkinsonian diseases and may assist distinguishing these conditions. In Aim 2 they use QSM and R2* MRI to study ROIs differentially impacted by PD, MSA-P and PSP to identify iron accumulation biomarkers to help distinguish these diseases. In Aim 3 the investigators apply machine learning classification algorithms to identify multivariable MRI signatures of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to differentiate PD, MSA-P and PSP. Study outputs will be candidate MRI biomarkers and disease signatures. The long term goal of this research is to further develop these outputs for use as clinical diagnostic tools and as biomarkers for subject selection and outcome measurement in clinical trials.  Through this career award Dr. Huddleston will gain new skills in MRI methods, data science, and neural systems imaging in parkinsonian diseases. These new skills will enable Dr. Huddleston to design and lead interdisciplinary neuroimaging biomarker studies for Parkinson’s disease and related disorders. His mentor team is comprised of leaders in their fields. This team and the dynamic research environment at Emory University provide the necessary support for Dr. Huddleston to successfully transition to scientific independence. There is an urgent public health need for new treatments to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy, and objective tools to distinguish these diseases for clinical and research purposes are lacking. The outputs of the proposed research will be candidate MRI biomarkers and multivariable MRI signatures to differentiate these conditions. These candidate biomarkers may be developed for use in clinical trial designs to increase their odds of success, and they may also assist clinical diagnosis.",MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism,9666652,K23NS105944,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical assessments', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Iron', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple System Atrophy', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Progressive Supranuclear Palsy', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Red nucleus structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Subjects Selections', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromelanin', 'neuron loss', 'nigrostriatal system', 'novel', 'pars compacta', 'patient screening', 'putamen', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2018,192564,507546965,-0.0161939947962377
"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at a younger age have higher rates of complications than those diagnosed later in life. Given the lasting benefit conferred by early disease control, the initial care provided to this growing, high-risk population is particularly crucial. With this proposed career development award, Dr. Gopalan will acquire the research skills necessary to identify patients at highest risk for inadequate early disease control, define barriers to initial disease management, and develop an intervention designed to improve the care of adults (ages 21-44) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,9666625,K23DK116968,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Institution', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United Kingdom', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diabetes education', 'diabetes management', 'disorder control', 'eHealth', 'early onset', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'literacy', 'macrovascular disease', 'member', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'racial and ethnic', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'young adult']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K23,2018,194005,111231681,-0.014058873536387205
"A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney Project Summary  Despite the widespread prevalence of ultrasound imaging in hospitals today, the clinical utility of ultrasound guidance is severely hampered by clutter and reverberation artifacts that obscure structures of interest and com- plicate anatomical measurements. Clutter is particularly problematic in overweight and obese individuals, who account for 78.6 million adults and 12.8 million children in North America. Similarly, interventional procedures of- ten require insertion of one or more metal tools, which generate reverberation artifacts that obfuscate instrument location, orientation, and geometry, while obscuring nearby tissues, thus additionally hampering ultrasound im- age quality. Although artifacts are problematic, ultrasound continues to persist primarily because of its greatest strengths (i.e., mobility, cost, non-ionizing radiation, real-time visualization, and multiplanar views) in comparison to existing image-guidance options, but it would be signiﬁcantly more useful without problematic artifacts.  Our long-term project goal is to use state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to provide interventional radiologists with artifact-free ultrasound-based images. We will initially develop a new framework alternative to the ultrasound beamforming process that removes needle tip reverberations and acoustic clutter caused by multipath scattering in near-ﬁeld tissues when guiding needles to the kidney to enable removal of painful kidney stones. Our ﬁrst aim will test convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that input raw channel data and output human readable images with no artifacts caused by multipath scattering and reverberations. A secondary goal of the CNNs is to learn the minimum number of parameters required to create these new CNN-based images. Our second aim will validate the trained algorithms with ultrasound data from experimental phantom and ex vivo tissue. Our third aim will extend our evaluation to ultrasound images of in vivo porcine kidneys. This work is the ﬁrst to propose bypassing the entire beamforming process and replacing it with machine learning and computer vision techniques to remove traditionally problematic noise artifacts and create a fundamentally new type of artifact-free, high-contrast, high-resolution, ultrasound-based image for guiding interventional procedures.  This work combines the expertise of an imaging scientist, a computer scientist, and an interventional ra- diologist to explore an untapped, understudied area that is only recently made feasible through improvements in computing power, advances in computer vision capabilities, and new knowledge about dominant sources of image degradation. Translation to in vivo cases is enabled by our clinical collaboration with the Department of Radiology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. With support from the NIH Trailblazer Award, our team will be the ﬁrst to develop these tools and capabilities to eliminate noise artifacts in interventional ultrasound, opening the door to a new paradigm in ultrasound image formation, which will directly beneﬁt millions of patients with clearer, easier-to-interpret ultrasound images. Subsequent R01 funding will customize our innovation to addi- tional application-speciﬁc ultrasound procedures (e.g., breast biopsies, cancer detection, autonomous surgery). Project Narrative Artifacts in ultrasound images, speciﬁcally artifacts caused by multipath scattering and acoustic reverberations (which occur when imaging through the abdominal tissue of overweight and obese patients or visualizing metallic surgical tools), remain as a major clinical challenge. There are no existing solutions to eliminate these artifacts based on today's signal processing techniques. The goal of this project is to step away from conventional signal processing models and instead learn from raw data examples with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques that differentiate artifacts from true signals, and thereby deliver clearer, easier-to-interpret images.",A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney,9600285,R21EB025621,"['Abdomen', 'Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biopsy', 'Breast biopsy', 'Bypass', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cardiac', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Cyst', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family suidae', 'Fatty Liver', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interventional Ultrasonography', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Liver diseases', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Needles', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Nonionizing Radiation', 'North America', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Overweight', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Readability', 'Resolution', 'Retroperitoneal Space', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surgical Instruments', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical effect', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'fetal', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'imaging scientist', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'lens', 'metallicity', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'signal processing', 'tool']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,194115,807432003,-0.003949835772968807
"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015). He has published in several gastroenterology journals, presented research internationally, and has built the independent collaborations featured in this proposal. Central to this career development award, the candidate will leverage the expertise of several mentors and collaborators to develop deep foundational skillsets in analytic imaging, translational proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods. The University of Michigan houses a nationally recognized Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, internationally recognized proteomics expertise, and a dedicated Analytic Morphomics Group focused on computational image analysis of organs. The mentored research training will be supplemented with focused graduate-level coursework in bioinformatics, medical image analysis, machine learning methodologies, and decision support systems provided through the University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the School of Public Health. The Division of Gastroenterology and Department of Medicine have a history of strong support for Dr. Stidham and will provide the time, resources, and mentorship necessary to achieve his professional and research goals. The training provided through this career development award will be pivotal for the candidate's development as an independent translational investigator focused on individualizing therapeutic management. This research will provide the foundation for future collaborative studies to further develop these and other prognostic tools for the inflammatory bowel diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work evaluates the capabilities of quantitative image analysis and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict the probability of medical response in Crohn's disease. Improved prediction of therapeutic response would tailor Crohn's disease management such that patients unlikely to benefit from medical therapy can proceed to timely surgical management and be spared the risks and costs of modern immunosuppressive treatments.",Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease,9513528,K23DK101687,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Colonoscopy', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Fibrosis', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intestinal Fibrosis', 'Intestines', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Serum', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Steroids', 'Surgical Management', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'blood-based biomarker', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital imaging', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'glycoproteomics', 'improved', 'large bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'learning strategy', 'lecturer', 'matriculation', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool development', 'translational impact', 'translational scientist', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2018,194368,641965656,0.020297226064954644
"Temporal Dietary and Physical Activity Patterns Related to Health Outcomes ABSTRACT Patterns (e.g. frequency, amount, etc.) of dietary intake and daily physical activity have each been independently linked with an increasing prevalence of obesity. Yet, connecting these patterns to obesity and chronic disease through the integration of time has not been previously considered. Given the strong evidence for independent linkages between each of these patterns and obesity, there is a critical need to determine the potential synergistic correlation of these patterns of behavior within the framework of a relationship with health. In the absence of such insights, opportunities for early detection of behavioral patterns that predispose obesity and chronic disease will be missed, and our long-term research goal to create these early detection strategies will not be met. The central hypothesis of this project is based on the analytical framework and methodology that was previously developed by the investigators: that daily patterns of energy intake, when integrated with physical activity, will be associated with health in a representative sample of U.S. adults 20 to 65 y (NHANES 2003-2006). The objectives in this R21 application include the development of data patterning methodology that can be used to create distinct dietary intake and physical activity patterns and then successfully integrate these patterns to identify population temporal pattern clusters. Next, the investigators will evaluate the cluster relationships with obesity and health outcomes and compare the integrated clusters to the un-integrated dietary and activity pattern clusters. The working hypotheses are firstly, that novel distance measures based on dynamic time warping for the dietary and physical activity data can be integrated to produce meaningful clustering related to health, and secondly, that a population cluster which exhibits a pattern of evenly spaced eating occasions, moderate energy consumption and moderate physical activity patterns in a 24 hour day will be associated with normal weight and without chronic disease, and that relationships with health outcomes will be stronger for the integrated temporal pattern clusters compared with un-integrated temporal dietary clusters and physical activity clusters. The rationale for this research is that its successful completion is expected to create data reduction methods that classify temporal lifestyle patterns linked to disease, further, the expectation is that these analytical techniques will integrate multidimensional temporal dietary and physical activity data. These outcomes are expected to have a significant positive impact, not only in developing/evaluating new analytic methods but in laying the groundwork for data based preventative interventions. This proposed research is potentially significant because results will provide a starting point for understanding the importance of the timing of dietary and physical activity patterns to the prevention of obesity and disease with potentially broad translational  RELEVANCE TO NIH The proposed research is relevant to public health because preventative time-based dietary and physical activity patterns will be identified among the US population, which are expected to open new research horizons for evidence-based recommendations for healthy lifestyles. The project is relevant to NIH's mission because individualized early detection of lifestyles supporting health or linked with disease may be attainable through the development of analytical techniques integrating multiple layers of data. Such strategies could be applied to utilize the increasing information from personal electronic monitoring devices and to detect patterns associated with positive and negative health outcomes.",Temporal Dietary and Physical Activity Patterns Related to Health Outcomes,9601212,R21CA224764,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Chronic Disease', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietary Factors', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eating', 'Energy Intake', 'Exhibits', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Moderate Exercise', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Sleep', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'data reduction', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'expectation', 'health data', 'healthy lifestyle', 'inferential statistics', 'innovation', 'insight', 'modifiable behavior', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity prevention', 'prevent', 'speech processing', 'unhealthy lifestyle', 'waist circumference']",NCI,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,195600,64946317,-0.009856185258894803
"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carolyn Hendrickson, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Hendrickson is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented research of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a focus on the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This K23 award will provide Dr. Hendrickson with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert clinical and translational researcher in ARDS after traumatic injury; (2) to study the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after TBI involving platelet biology, endothelial activation, and lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation; (3) to implement advanced analyses of complex observational data, including machine learning; (4) to develop an independent translational research career. Dr. Hendrickson's plan to achieve these goals is supported by a multidisciplinary mentoring team of experts. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Matthay, has extensive experience in translational ARDS research and in the career development of early stage investigators. Dr. Hendrickson will work with four co-mentors: Dr. Mitchell Cohen, a translational researcher studying coagulation after trauma, Dr. Alan Hubbard, a biostatistician specializing in causal inference, Dr. Geoffrey Manley, a neurosurgeon and leading investigator in TBI research, and Dr. Mark Looney, an expert platelet biology and lung injury. The development of ARDS after TBI is common and is associated with worse neurological outcomes. The biologic mechanisms driving ARDS after TBI are poorly understood. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the risk of ARDS after TBI is mediated through activated vascular endothelium and platelets as well as non-protective mechanical ventilation strategies that use large tidal volumes. Dr. Hendrickson will investigate these causal pathways utilizing previously collected data and plasma from an ongoing observational cohort study. In this same cohort she will prospectively collect biospecimens, detailed mechanical ventilation data, and lung ultrasound images. This proposal represents an innovative approach to studying ARDS after TBI using carefully adjudicated exposures and outcomes. Dr. Hendrickson will test whether plasma biomarkers of endothelial activation, vascular permeability, and inflammation (Aim 1) and platelet function, activation, and aggregation (Aim 2) are associated with ARDS after TBI. She will collect lung ultrasound images and frequent mechanical ventilation data including tidal volumes and plateau pressures. She will test whether early exposure to non-protective mechanical ventilation is associated with ARDS after TBI (Aim 3). Addressing this gap in knowledge may lead to interventions that prevent ARDS and improve outcomes in this patient population. The research and training outlined in this proposal will form the basis for an R01-level proposal designed to study interventions to prevent and treat ARDS after traumatic injury. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because each year in the United States 1.7 million people sustain a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and over 20% of patients with severe isolated TBI develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a form of serious lung disease associated with poor neurological outcomes after TBI. Identification of biologic factors and mechanical ventilation parameters that contribute to ARDS pathogenesis after TBI is the first step in a continuum of research that will pave the way to prevention, personalized risk assessment, improved early management, and targeted treatments for ARDS in patients with TBI.

In recent times non mydriatic UWF SLO imaging has been shown to be a promising alternative to conventional digital color fundus imaging for grading of diabetic eye diseases, with advantages including 130°-200° field-of-view showing more than 80% of the retina in a single image, no need for multiple fields, multiple flashes, or refocusing between field acquisitions, ability to penetrate media opacities like cataract, and lower rate of ungradable images. UWF SLO images are particularly suitable for detecting predominantly peripheral lesions (PPLs), which have been associated with higher risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR) progression. Accurate quantification of presence and extent of PPLs can only be done by a robust automated tool that is specifically designed for the pseudo-colored images of UWF SLO modality. EyeReadUWF will automatically characterize lesions in pseudo colored UWF images while handling possible artifacts from eyelashes and determine the lesion predominance in peripheral and central regions of UWF image. The ability to accurately quantify the presence and extent of predominantly peripheral lesions in UWF SLO images can enable clinicians to triage patients with higher risk of DR progression and onset of PDR, have a positive impact on diabetic patient management, and aid drug discovery research. Narrative The proposed tool, EyeReadUWF, will perform automated lesion characterization in ultra- widefield scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (UWF SLO) images to quantify the presence and extent of predominantly peripheral lesions (PPLs), which have been associated with higher risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR) progression. To the best of our knowledge, no commercial automated analysis tool is currently indicated for UWF SLO images. Once clinically validated, the tool can enable clinicians to triage patients with higher risk of DR progression and onset of PDR, have a positive impact on diabetic patient management, and aid drug discovery research.",Fully-automated lesion characterization in ultrawide-field retinal images,9559582,R43EY028081,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-HIV Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Blindness', 'Cataract', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Color', 'Competence', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Exudate', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Eyelash', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Institutes', 'Lasers', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Microaneurysm', 'Modality', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Normalcy', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Output', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Retina', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Speed', 'Spottings', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'digital', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'fovea centralis', 'fundus imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'operation', 'proliferative diabetic retinopathy', 'retinal imaging', 'screening', 'screening program', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NEI,"EYENUK, INC.",R43,2018,216440,1300000,-0.014415004460197929

The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9530648,K01ES026835,"['Affect', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Drug-sensitive', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'improved', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIEHS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K01,2018,220530,178569161,-0.004766401168269072
"Real-time Monitoring of Zebrafish ECG with Automated Aberrant Pattern Detection Abstract Sensoriis, Inc is a company that, develops evidence-based sensing solutions to support biological investigations and address health care problems. The goal of this NIH STTR grant with University of Washington (UW) is to provide a flexible system to assess cardiac electrical activities in zebrafish models, supporting heart disease studies and drug screening. Unlike humans, zebrafish hearts can fully regenerate following cardiac injury, thereby providing a tractable model system to study endogenous heart regeneration. Zebrafish have also proven to be an ideal vertebrate model system for phenotype-based screening owing to their physiological similarity to mammals. Further, zebrafish model enables a forward genetic approach to reveal the genetic basis and underlying molecular mechanisms of numerous heart diseases. The conventional setup for cardiac phenotype acquisition in zebrafish (i.e. electrocardiogram – ECG) involves sedation causing variation in functionality. To date, there is no system which can offer cardiac phenotype monitoring in freely-swimming zebrafish, not to mention for multiple fish simultaneously. In this context, we propose and develop 1) a wireless flexible “jacket” to be worn by zebrafish for real-time assessment of electrical cardiac phenotypes, namely ECG; and 2) a simple-yet-novel apparatus to collect ECG of multiple awake fish. Our devices provide pivotal platforms for cardiac phenotype-related investigations. The obtained data will be processed by smart algorithms to detect aberrant ECG patterns in real time. The proposed systems will facilitate related studies using zebrafish models. Further, the success of this platform also paves the avenue for regenerative medicine and developmental biology studies as well as stem cell-based therapies for cardiac repair. In Phase I of this STTR grant, we will develop i) a polymer-based microelectrode array (MEA) jacket that could be comfortably worn by the zebrafish and provide wireless ECG acquisition; and ii) a 4-chamber apparatus for simultaneous recording of ECG in awake fish. Machine learning-based programs with embedded algorithms will be developed to distinguish ECG patterns such as heart rate, ST and QT intervals, thus can identify anomalies, such as arrhythmias or prolonged QTs. For proof of concept, the system will be validated and compared. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this Phase I STTR grant, Sensoriis, Inc and the University of Washington will develop 1) a world-first wireless flexible membrane for zebrafish with a micro-electrode array (MEA) for ECG measurement and electronics for wireless powering and communication with an external unit; 2) a simple-yet-novel 4-chamber apparatus to acquire ECG of 4 awake fish; and 3) Machine learning-based programs to process the data and detect desired patterns. The goal is to facilitate and reduce cost and time of cardiac phenotype-based screening in the zebrafish models, supporting numerous studies.

"System-independent quantitative cardiac CT perfusion System-independent quantitative cardiac CT perfusion Summary BioInVision, Inc. and Case Western Reserve University researchers will develop software for quantitative anal- ysis of cardiac CT perfusion (CCTP), creating an important tool for evaluation of cardiovascular disease. With this product, cardiologists will be able to identify functional flow deficits in coronary artery territories. When one combines functional myocardial blood flow (MBF) with coronary anatomy from computed tomography angi- ography (CTA), it provides needed information on the physiologic significance of a stenosis. The CTA+CCTP combo could provide an ideal gateway exam for deciding whether to send a patient for percutaneous invasive coronary angiography and potential intervention (e.g., stenting). In addition, if flow is low and no stenosis is present, it will suggest microvascular disease, a very prevalent ailment of growing concern, especially among women and in diabetes. CT compares favorably to all other non-invasive cardiovascular imaging techniques (SPECT, PET, and MRI). It is available in many settings, including emergency departments. It provides both MBF and reliable coronary anatomy, not available in any other single modality. It has excellent resolution ena- bling detection of endocardial perfusion deficit, thought to be an early disease indicator that is impossible to assess with SPECT. CT is cheaper and has higher patient throughput than MRI or PET. With inclusion of MBF, CT would have an excellent opportunity to disrupt the diagnostic pathway leading to percutaneous intervention, a pathway now dominated by SPECT myocardial imaging, which includes zero information about coronary anatomy. To achieve reliable, accurate CT MBF measurements, we will invoke innovations to reduce beam hardening and to make reliable estimates of flow. Currently, CT perfusion is done on different CT machines with manufacturers’ proprietary software, using algorithms that can give erroneous MBFs. Applicable to any commercial scanner; our solution would harmonize measurements across acquisition systems providing trust- worthy, standardized measurements to clinicians, thereby improving management of cardiovascular patients. Narrative We will develop software to enable reliable evaluation of blood flow in heart tissue using CT imaging. With suc- cess, our project could lead to an improved gateway examination that could reduce unnecessary invasive cor- onary angiography, thereby reducing costs, patient discomfort, patient risk, and possibly unnecessary interven- tional therapies.",System-independent quantitative cardiac CT perfusion,9622204,R41HL144271,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Attention', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Calibration', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary artery', 'Cost Savings', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Family suidae', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inferior', 'Intervention', 'Iodine', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardium', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevalence', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Stents', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'blood flow measurement', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'cost', 'design', 'detector', 'digital', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'perfusion imaging', 'pre-clinical', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHLBI,"BIOINVISION, INC.",R41,2018,224240,0,-0.00183374617633899
"A wearable device to detect opioid overdose and to prevent death Bioresp Technologies, Inc. proposes development of RespiLife, a new wearable device to to track physiologic data for early detection of opioid overdose and to relay data and the generated alerts to relevant caregivers for further intervention.

"Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema Approximately 25% of the millions of veterans (est. 8.92 million FY 2013) enrolled for care in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have diabetes mellitus, and diabetic macular edema (DME) is the leading cause of vision loss in the adult diabetic population world-wide. Although diabetic retinopathy has been well-studied, comparatively little is known about the burden of DME. In fact, only two national prevalence studies and no national study on the incidence of DME in persons with type 2 diabetes have been conducted. Similarly many risk factors have been characterized for DR, but no large studies have established predictors for DME.  Beyond the Medicare claims database, the VHA National Patient Care Database (NPCD) contains standardized administrative data for several aspects of patient care including diagnoses, procedures, medications, lab test results, vital signs, clinical text notes, and mortality. Because the VA uses teleretinal screening as routine clinical care for all patients with diabetes with these results included in the NPCD, the NPCD is an ideal source for studying the epidemiology of and risk factors for DME.  This study proposes to determine the burden of diabetic macular edema, establish risk factors, and examine treatment outcomes in a previously extracted dataset on 1.98 million veterans who have undergone diabetic retinopathy screening at least once since 2004. Currently invaluable ophthalmic data are encoded in unstructured clinical encounter notes in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), and no validated automated extraction method exists to capture these data elements. An automated extraction method using natural language processing will be created and validated to unlock key ophthalmic variables. These text extraction methods will be applicable to extracting ophthalmology data from not only notes of patients with DME but also any ophthalmology clinical note. This will enable future large scale studies in ophthalmology using NPCD and be immediately valuable to the research community at large.  The candidate, Dr. Aaron Lee, MD MSCI, is an ophthalmologist with subspecialty training in retina surgery with a strong background in computer science and epidemiology. His career goal is to become an independent clinician scientist studying diabetic eye disease with large-scale electronic medical record extracted data. While he possesses the foundational skills, he seeks to gain training in advanced statistics and natural language processing to unlock the data captured in unstructured clinical encounter notes. He has assembled an outstanding mentorship team under the primary mentor, Dr. Edward Boyko, MD MPH. This mentorship team includes renowned experts in clinical epidemiology, health informatics, ophthalmology, and natural language processing. This K23 will provide Dr. Lee the structured coursework, mentorship, and applied learning needed to acquire new research skills. He will leverage key local resources to carry out the proposed research at the University of Washington and the VA Seattle Epidemiologic Research and Information Center. Despite the significant visual loss associated with diabetic macular edema, little is known about the frequency of its occurrence, its risk factors, and the real-world effectiveness of existing treatments. The purpose of this proposed research is to utilize the VA National Patient Care Database to extract relevant data elements to examine these three clinical questions: 1) what is the incidence and prevalence of diabetic macular edema, 2) what are the risk factors associated with its development, and 3) what is the comparative real-world effectiveness of its treatments, including intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, intravitreal corticosteroid therapy and macular laser.

"Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy Over 5 million children and adults in the United States have had a diagnosis of epilepsy or a seizure disorder. However, treatment options for the epilepsies remain inadequate, because many patients suffer from uncontrolled seizures and from the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to the faster development of new anti-convulsant therapies is the fact that rigorous preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). We propose to test if it is possible to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in various mouse models of acquired and genetic epilepsies. The approach rests on the recent recognition that mouse behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules at sub-second timescales that are arranged according to specific rules. These characteristic behavioral modules, and the transitions between them, can be identified without observer bias by combined 3D imaging and machine learning (ML) -assisted analytic methods. We propose to adopt this novel ML-assisted 3D video analysis technology to epilepsy research, in order to test if it can be used to identify mice with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) during inter-ictal and ictal periods in two distinct experimental TLE models, and under various experimental conditions. In addition, we will also test whether the approach is able to automatically detect not only the overtly epileptic mice in a genetic model of severe childhood epilepsy (homozygous voltage-gated sodium channel β-subunit SCN1B-/- knock-out mice), but also distinguish the seemingly normal, non-epileptic, SCN1B+/- heterozygous mice from the wild-type controls. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user-independent, inexpensive analysis of acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will test if it is possible to objectively characterize epileptic phenotypes in mice using a breakthrough technology involving machine learning-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of behavior.

"Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This “Pathway to Independence” award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position. Ultimately, she aims to become a faculty member in a radiology or bioengineering institute, where she can further research technical biomedical imaging and machine learning developments applied to the musculoskeletal system. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morphological and compositional MRI quantifications are widely used tools to detect early cartilage degeneration and to study disease progression of osteoarthritis, a complex and multifactorial disorder. In this project, we propose to develop a fully automatic image post-processing pipeline and multidimensional big data analyses based on machine learning techniques, with the aim to uncover latent information from complex dataset and with the ultimate goal of setting up a platform for OA precision medicine",Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis,9723310,R00AR070902,"['Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'California', 'Cartilage', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Gait', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Institutes', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Scanning', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'bone', 'career development', 'cartilage degradation', 'connectome', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging scientist', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'kinematics', 'member', 'modifiable risk', 'morphometry', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'parallel processing', 'precision medicine', 'quantitative imaging', 'racial difference', 'repository', 'shape analysis', 'soft tissue', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R00,2018,249000,685608202,0.01941371227443028
"In Vivo Mapping of Uncharted Functional Units of Tongue Motion During Speech Project Summary Tongue cancer and the treatments used to cure the disease such as glossectomy can have debilitating effects on speech and swallowing, yet not much is known about the relationship between tongue movements in speech and reconstruction choices after cancer resection. The tongue’s vital role in speaking and swallowing is executed by a uniquely complex array of muscles which deform locally into functional units. Tongue movements are governed by synergistic activation of these functional units using orthogonally oriented muscle fibers not a rigid skeletal structure. Functional units, which are regions of 3D coherent motion, are the structures that link low-level muscle activity to high-level surface tongue geometry. This link, the organization of functional units, can provide considerable insight into normal motor control and adapted tongue motion, as in patients who have had surgery for tongue cancer. However, there is poor understanding of the details of how muscle morphology contributes to function due to tongue muscle interdigitation and complex local activation. A key to understanding the relationship between the structure and function of the tongue is to identify functional units of motion in localized tongue regions and map them to muscle anatomy. A large step in this direction can be gained by developing a tool to cluster 3D coherent motion patterns from tagged MRI, and register them to muscle anatomy from high-resolution MRI. Speech motor control is a critical area of importance where platform tools for machine learning techniques are lacking. The goal of this project is to create a framework to relate the functional units to tongue muscle anatomy. This framework will enhance tongue motion analysis in medical research and clinical applications, where MRI is frequently used. To address this goal, we have already developed technologies to analyze high-resolution and tagged-MRI. The first is a detailed 3D muscle atlas based on 3D high-resolution MRI, which depicts the locations of both extrinsic and intrinsic muscles, and will be registered to each speaker to identify and track their muscles in the 3D tagged data sets. The second is software to derive 3D displacement and strain fields from tagged MR images. These displacements, strains, and derived quantities will be used to extract spatio-temporal feature vectors that define coherent regions, which will be verified with simulation. The vectors will then be input into a novel computational method using a NMF and clustering, the goal of which is to establish the functional units of speech. In addition, biomechanical simulations will be used to co-validate our findings. The concept of functional units is at the core of the proposed work, as it can provide insights into tongue muscle coordination in patients after glossectomy surgery. The research plan comprises two specific aims: (1) develop a computational method to establish functional units from MRI and (2) determine the relationship between alterations in anatomy and alterations in functional unit motion after tongue cancer treatment. Linking the functional units to the anatomy will allow the design of more focused treatments and therapies for tongue motion-related disorders. Project Narrative Functions of the tongue—speaking, eating, and breathing—are executed by using a complex muscular array to create global motions (synergies) by deforming local functional units which are intermediate structures that link muscle activity to surface tongue geometry. This project will develop new computational tools that will enable researchers and clinicians to determine the functional units of specific motions and relate them to the muscle anatomy. Such a breakthrough will dramatically improve our knowledge of the mechanisms of muscle coordination, thereby permitting improvement of diagnosis and treatment of tongue motion-related disorders.",In Vivo Mapping of Uncharted Functional Units of Tongue Motion During Speech,9452335,R21DC016047,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Bone structure', 'Breathing', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Elements', 'Excision', 'Geometry', 'Gestures', 'Glossectomy', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Fibers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Therapy', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Extracts', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Treatment-Related Cancer', 'Unit of Measure', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'digital', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'malignant tongue neoplasm', 'motor control', 'muscular structure', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predict clinical outcome', 'reconstruction', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'synergism', 'theories', 'tool', 'vector']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2018,249441,551214295,-0.08017082695397815
"Distinguishing Lipid Subtypes by Amplifying Contrast from J-Coupling Project Summary/Abstract With the global rise in obesity-related diseases and increasing recognition of the role of fat in diseases such as fatty liver, there is growing need for a noninvasive chemical assay of in vivo lipid depots. But the rich chemistry of these molecules is often ignored in MRI, which typically treats fat as a homogeneous proton species because differences in chemical shift and relaxation are difficult to distinguish in a clinical setting. Innovation: This proposal will be the first to use nonuniform echo spacing to generate J-coupling based contrast between chemically different fats. While fat spins often give monotonically decaying signal under a uniformly spaced spin echo train, J-coupling causes nonuniformly spaced spin echo trains to generate complex fingerprints, which distinguish and even quantify fats with otherwise similar MR properties. Significance: The immediate clinical impact will be to demonstrate a novel J-coupling based contrast mechanism in vivo which will contribute to a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish the 25% of the population with benign steatosis from the 2-3% with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The broader significance of this work is that this novel contrast mechanism could revolutionize the study and clinical management of many diseases associated with bioactive lipid subtypes. Approach: The aims are designed to test the hypothesis that nonuniform echo trains (1) can create contrast between different fats, which (2) will contribute to a multiparametric noninvasive protocol to distinguish benign steatosis and NASH. Aim 1 will identify the echo spacing best suited for distinguishing benign steatosis and NASH, first using density matrix simulations based on high resolution spectra of liver fat from animals with each disease, and then using experiments on whole rat livers. In Aim 2, the sequence developed in Aim 1 will be tested in humans with biopsy proven benign steatosis or NASH, along with a suite of standard methods of liver and fat characterization. This metric, and also metrics derived from conventional images, will be tested for the ability to separate these patient groups. In addition, machine learning algorithms will be used to find a metric that combines multiecho intensities with standard MR metrics. This proposal will prove the usefulness of nonuniform echo trains as a new contrast mechanism and yield a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish simple steatosis and NASH. Moreover, this general approach to distinguish fats could ultimately find a broad range of biomedical applications, such as imaging lipid based therapeutics, distinguishing the 4 fatty acids that make up 90% of the adipose stores, or detecting other lipotoxic subtypes. The results of this work will justify a larger scale study to properly validate the sensitivity to different fat species in humans. Project Narrative This proposal will prove the usefulness of nonuniform echo trains both as a new J-coupling based contrast mechanism and as part of a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish simple steatosis (~25% of the population) from patients on the NASHfibrosiscirrhosis trajectory of metabolically induced liver disease (2- 3% of the population). Moreover, this general approach to distinguish fats could ultimately find a broad range of biomedical applications, such as imaging lipid based therapeutics, distinguishing the 4 fatty acids that make up 90% of the adipose stores, or detecting other lipotoxic subtypes.

"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018 Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network 2018 Renewal ABSTRACT In the past 5 years, the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) has increased cumulative enrollment to over 2000 adult and pediatric patients in the ongoing Prospective and Retrospective registry studies. In addition, an “Acute” DILI protocol with collection of serial early biological samples for mechanistic biomarker studies was developed and implemented. Other network aims included investigation of the role of genetic polymorphisms in DILI susceptibility and outcome, development of improved causality assessment methods, and expansion of the LiverTox website. The University of Michigan team led by Dr. Fontana has played an important role in the design, implementation, and analysis of the primary and ancillary DILIN studies since its inception in 2003. Michigan has not only been a leading enroller in all of the ongoing Registry studies but also provided important leadership in multiple DILIN committees and initiatives. The Michigan team now proposes a series of novel and feasible study aims for the DILIN renewal. The PRIMARY AIM of this proposal is to continue to recruit and enroll high causality adult and pediatric DILI cases into the registry studies for genetic, immunologic, biomarker and mechanistic studies. The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Network has specific plans to increase the enrollment of ethnic minorities via the engagement of hepatologists/ collaborators in southeastern Michigan and elsewhere that care for a large number of African American, Hispanic, and Asian patients. In addition, further development of natural language processing algorithms to search the EMR at the University of Michigan are proposed to facilitate enrollment. Qualitative, quantitative and toxicological studies of the chemical constituents in the herbal and dietary supplement (HDS) products implicated in a growing proportion of DILI cases will be expanded via an ongoing collaboration with the National Center for National Products Research. The SECOND AIM of this proposal is to conduct pilot/ feasibility clinical trials to improve the outcomes of patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI. Proposed study designs include a 12 week course of a simple and safe, orally administered anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidant agent (e.g. budesonide, SAMe, vitamin E) in selected patients with severe acute DILI at risk for adverse outcomes. In addition, 12 to 24 week studies of a safe and effective orally administered anti- cholestatic agent such as an ileal apical bile salt transport inhibitor that may reduce serum bile acids are proposed for subjects at risk of chronic DILI. Lastly, prospective studies of magnetic resonance elastography and MRCP imaging are proposed to improve our understanding of the severity and natural history of DILI. The THIRD AIM of this proposal is to further expand the LiverTox website to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, develop and implement a computerized causality assessment instrument, and assemble working committees to insure that the website content remains up to date and pertinent. Finally, additional collaborations between DILIN and the US FDA and other regulatory agencies are proposed to enhance the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN for new causes of DILI and temporal changes over time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The University of Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the etiologies, risk factors, and outcomes of DILI via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients including targeted enrollment of ethnic minority patients that will help determine if there are racial differences in DILI susceptibility and outcomes via analysis of collected biological samples, DNA, liver tissue, and clinical data. Pilot/ feasibility clinical trials of simple, safe and mechanistically based treatments for patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI are also proposed. Finally, further development and enhancement of the LiverTox website is proposed to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, development and implementation of a computerized diagnostic instrument, and expansion of the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018,9608453,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antioxidants', 'Apical', 'Asians', 'Assessment tool', 'Bile Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Budesonide', 'Caring', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Chinese People', 'Cholestasis', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic study', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Herbal supplement', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologics', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance Elastography', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Oxidants', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'S-Adenosylmethionine', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'Taiwan', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vitamin E', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'bile salts', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized', 'design', 'ethnic minority population', 'hepatotoxin', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'instrument', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outreach', 'pediatric patients', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'racial difference', 'recruit', 'repository', 'sample collection', 'transcriptomics', 'transport inhibitor', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2018,295209,641965656,-0.009234920797844465
"FAST platform for same-shift, complete antibiotic menu antibiotic susceptibility testing The goal of this Phase I SBIR proposal is to demonstrate utility to all major pathogenic bacterial strains of SeLux’s rapid, low-cost, phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) system (fast-AST or FAST). Utilizing existing optical detectors and standard dried antibiotic microplates, and avoiding pitfalls of metabolic probes, FAST will potentially transform therapy of infections by significantly accelerating AST, thereby facilitating treatment with the optimal antibiotic. Aim 1 will apply FAST to hundreds of samples of pathogenic bacterial strains, while developing and optimizing a predictive algorithm for clinical utility. Aim 2 will extend the FAST platform to slow-growing strains and species as well. SeLux has demonstrated FAST to exceed FDA 510(k) requirements for minimum inhibitory concentration determinations for 25+ strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli with full antibiotic panels. Completion of the proposed aims will expand FAST to all major clinically-relevant, non-fastidious bacterial pathogens. SeLux’s interdisciplinary team has expertise in nanosensing, microbiology, and algorithm design and is buttressed by distinguished experts in Clinical Microbiology, Infectious Disease, and Machine Learning. The new paradigm in clinical medicine is value-based healthcare, which requires rapid and accurate diagnoses leading to optimal patient treatment. Nowhere is this more important than in treating infections, where doctors are currently forced to overprescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics during an agonizing 48+ hour wait for antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) results. The novel, rapid, low-cost AST platform described in this proposal promises to reduce this delay in treatment by as much as 30 hours. This advance would be transformative for the treatment of infections because current over-use of broad-spectrum antibiotics not only harms individual patients but is a primary contributor to the growing epidemic of antibiotic resistance.","FAST platform for same-shift, complete antibiotic menu antibiotic susceptibility testing",9464993,R43AI136125,"['Agreement', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Amplifiers', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Biological Assay', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'End Point Assay', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Escherichia coli', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Invaded', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement', 'Optics', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Quality of Care', 'Reagent', 'Recovery', 'Regulatory Affairs', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Vancomycin', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'combat', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'detector', 'individual patient', 'instrument', 'nanosensors', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'pathogen', 'performance tests', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis']",NIAID,"SELUX DIAGNOSTICS, INC.",R43,2018,298851,1000000,-0.004948988853093345

"Hamamatsu Nanozoomer S60 Digital Whole Slide Scanner Project Summary/Abstract This application is for a shared instrumentation grant from the Light Microscope Imaging Facility at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) School of Medicine (SOM) to acquire a fully automated, high-capacity, high- resolution Hamamatsu Nanozoomer S60 slide scanner that can accommodate both brightfield and fluorescence imaging in single-slide and double-slide formats. We also request MicroDimensions 3D reconstruction and alignment software packages for manipulating and analyzing the whole slide images produced with the scanner. We need to replace a scanner that is not functioning properly. Our well-established shared core facility supports NIH-funded investigators by giving them access to state-of-the-art microscopy technologies that enhance collaborative, multidisciplinary research. Acquisition of this instrument will have a high impact on the biomedical research at CWRU and expand the scope of our NIH-funded projects. Several projects have been identified that will utilize the scanner and its associated analyses programs. These include: the genetic mechanisms underlying skin fibrosis and cranial bone development (Atit); the mechanisms behind the lifelong functions of transcription factors in axonal growth and architecture (Deneris); deep-learning for histologic image predictors of various diseases (Madabhushi); the development of diagnostic probes to discriminate between glioma subtypes for screening and survival therapies (Brady-Kalnay); the role of progesterone receptors in the control of parturition and the development of therapies to prevent preterm birth (Messiano); the mechanisms by which breast cancer stem cells overcome metastatic latency leading to disease recurrence and the biomarkers that could potentially identify those tumors likely to undergo this process (Schiemann); and the significance of cholesterol-related proteins in brain and retinal function (Pikuleva). Many additional projects of minor users and others at CWRU are anticipated. All of the proposed projects are in need of a high-capacity automated scanner acquiring whole slide images so that analyses can be applied to tissues that cover hundreds of fields of view, rather than the single regions of interest that can be acquired on a standard microscope. Narrative This proposal seeks to acquire a new, state-of-the-art high-speed, high content digital slide scanner for high resolution cellular and biomarker identfcation across large tissue areas. The dual mode (fluorescence and brightfield) allows flexibility in marker visualization while the software allows the automated alignment of whole slide images for multi-stain analysis and 3d reconstruction of serial section for in-depth analysis of specimens.

"Data-Driven Shape Analysis for Quantitative Severity Stratification in Patients with Metopic Craniosynostosis Abstract Craniosynostosis affects close to one in 2000 newborns and causes growth restriction perpendicular to the affected suture. Metopic craniosynostosis is the second most common form of craniosynostosis. The metopic suture is an important sight of cranial growth as the brain rapidly expands in the ﬁrst year of life. Patients affected by metopic craniosynostosis will present in the ﬁrst few months of life with varying degrees of narrowing of the forehead and brow, a triangular shaped head, and an abnormal eye position. Surgery is recommended early in childhood to normalize the head shape and expand the restricted skull to prevent complications such as headaches, cognitive impairment, and visual disturbances including blindness.  Imaging with computed tomography (CT) is employed to conﬁrm new diagnoses of metopic craniosynostosis and, together with the physical exam, is used in a descriptive and qualitative manner to assess the degree of head shape abnormality. Several methods have been employed to interpret the information provided in the CT scans to allow surgeons to utilize data for surgical decision making. However, these indices reduce the complex three-dimensional skull dysmorphology into isolated measurements of angles or proportions, require detailed calculations to perform, and no universally accepted standard has emerged so far despite signiﬁcant research efforts and clinical motivation.  In this grant proposal, we aim to increase our understanding of the cranial dysmorphology in patients with metopic craniosynostosis by employing latest results from statistical shape modeling and deep learning. Specif- ically, we will build a statistical shape model of pediatric skulls from CT images of patients with metopic cran- iosynostosis as well as a group of normal controls capturing normal phenotypical shape variations. The distance of a new shape from the normative shape space will represent the proposed Shape Normality Metric (SNM). The SNM will be validated against ratings from experts in the surgical community (current standard of care) who will be asked to assess the dysmorphology of the skulls in our database. To avoid surgeons' subjective bias, we will aggregate their response using statistical methods that compensate for potential individual bias. Finally, to streamline data collection for future research we will develop a head-shape portal that will allow users to upload CT scans of their patients and the system will automatically calculate the SNM.  By developing a severity metric that encompasses the entire extent of dysmorphology in metopic craniosyn- ostosis and establishing a head-shape portal, we will improve our understanding of the spectrum of metopic craniosynostosis, aid in pre-operative and surgical decision making, enable future research, and help facilitate longitudinal outcomes assessments and multi-center communication and collaboration. Narrative This grant proposal aims to improve our understanding of the head shape anomaly associated with metopic craniosynostosis by using recent results from statistical shape analysis and deep learning, with the goal of developing an objective metopic cranioynostosis severity scale. Different from previously proposed metrics, our approach evaluates the entire shape as a whole. With this information, surgeons will be able to objectively determine how severely affected their patients are and will be better able to tailor their interventions to the needs of their individual patients. Additionally, surgeons will be able to better communicate with each other and study the effects of surgical intervention on their patients which will improve patient care in the long run.",Data-Driven Shape Analysis for Quantitative Severity Stratification in Patients with Metopic Craniosynostosis,9669833,R21EB026061,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Cephalic', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Deformity', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye Abnormalities', 'Forehead', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Headache', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Joint structure of suture of skull', 'Left', 'Letters', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Newborn Infant', 'Normalcy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Socialization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereophotogrammetries', 'Stratification', 'Supervision', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Trauma patient', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image processing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'operation', 'patient stratification', 'power analysis', 'premature', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'self esteem', 'shape analysis', 'standard of care', 'surgery outcome', 'web-based tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2018,317513,228951281,0.0036892028935350605
"Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in the laboratory sciences have led to the discovery of a large number of candidate biomarkers, which hold great potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. At this time, an important research bottleneck is the lack of well-developed statistical methods for effectively using these candidate biomarkers to enhance clinical practice. It is our goal to develop new tools to select, combine, and evaluate biomarkers for disease classification and treatment selection. Classification markers predict an individual's disease outcome and are useful for the detection of diseases at an early stage when a treatment is most effective. Research proposed in Aim 1 seeks to select and combine markers to improve the classification performance in disease screening and diagnosis. Treatment selection markers predict a patient's response to different therapies and allow for the selection of a therapy that has the best predicted outcome. Aim 2 seeks to develop marker-based treatment selection rules to maximize the benefit to the patient population. A biomarker that is useful for guiding treatment decision to the general population will have different values to different patients due to individual differences in their response to treatment and in their tolerance of the disease harm and treatment cost. Aim 3 seeks to develop a new graphical tool to customize the evaluation of a biomarker for aiding treatment decision based on personal characteristics.  Our statistical methods will apply broadly to general medical fields. In particular, we will apply these methods to analyze several cancer studies including (1) biomarker studies for prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer from the Early Detection and Research Network; (2) the Women's Health Initiative breast cancer genome-wide association study; and (3) the Oncotype-Dx breast cancer study from the Southwest Oncology Group. Programs and algorithms developed in this proposal will be made available to public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The focus of this proposal is to develop novel statistical methods for the design and analysis of biomarker studies. In particular, the proposed methods will develop marker combinations to improve disease diagnosis, develop treatment selection rules to cost-effectively reduce population disease burden, and help patients and clinicians make informed decisions about the use of medical tests in clinical practices.",Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers,9410515,R01GM106177,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'burden of illness', 'candidate marker', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'flexibility', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient population', 'patient response', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2018,323434,758431960,-0.05972077000156602
"Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rationale. Diabetes is a leading cause of renal disease, accounting for 40% of the estimated 20 million US adult cases of chronic kidney disease. There is, however, substantial heterogeneity across diabetic patients with regards to development of kidney disease. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic biomarkers that can provide early and reliable evidence of future kidney disease, so that high-risk patients can receive optimal medical care. Existing clinical, proteomic and genomic markers do not consistently nor accurately predict kidney function decline. Metabolomics, a systematic evaluation of the end-products of cellular function in fluids, has the potential to inform physiological and pathological effects of chronic diseases. Metabolomic analysis combined with advanced quantitative methods could play a key role in building clinically useful prognostic signatures of diabetic kidney disease. Yet, development of computational methods with adequate rigor has lagged behind the technical capacity to perform large scale quantitative metabolomics. In this proposal we aim to address this computational gap in diabetic kidney disease research. Aims. We will implement rigorous computational methods to identify robust prognostic metabolite + clinical + genetic signatures of diabetic kidney disease progression. Specifically, we aim to (i) test the accuracy of previous signatures, and apply state-of-the-art analytic techniques and novel statistical methods to identify new multivariate metabolite sets for predicting kidney disease progression; (ii) quantify patterns of co-regulation of metabolites in diabetic kidney disease, and develop new tools in network biology to discover novel enzymes, proteins, metabolites, and molecular pathways which are implicated in diabetic kidney disease progression; (iii) test if these models can accurately predict kidney disease progression in independent prospective cohorts. Methods. Using clinical, genetic and metabolomic data from large prospective cohorts of > 1200 diverse, well- characterized patients with Type 2 diabetes, we will apply statistical methods for variable selection (e.g., penalized regression), and machine learning methods (e.g., random forest), which are known to perform well in the high-dimensional setting, to identify robust and parsimonious signatures of kidney disease progression. We will quantify inter-metabolite co-regulation patterns and infer biological pathways implicated in diabetic kidney disease. Throughout the modeling process, a rigorous training-validation paradigm will be adopted in order to improve reproducibility of models and reduce chance findings. Impact. A major product of this work will be the development of a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline. Our findings will also provide insight into markers of renal dysfunction, and elucidate possible therapeutic targets for treating diabetic kidney disease, thus potentially informing the design of future clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney disease, a major and common complication of diabetes, can lead to repeated hospitalizations and premature death. There is an urgent need to develop clinical tools that can provide early evidence that a given diabetic patient is likely to progress to kidney disease in the future. In this proposal, we will identify new urinary biomarkers and use novel statistical modeling methods to create a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline, with the ultimate goal of improving disease management and reducing mortality rates for these patients.",Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease,9418599,R01DK110541,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pima Indian', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'biological heterogeneity', 'chemical association', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'forest', 'genetic signature', 'genomic biomarker', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'model development', 'mortality', 'nephrogenesis', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'predictive test', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,336980,524978793,0.011233691514759796
"High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs ABSTRACT In this application we will perform high throughput, high content, screening for small molecules that improve kidney regeneration after acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI presents a dire unmet medical need because of its high prevalence with long-term adverse health effects and life-threatening sequelae. Mortality is high and the only effective treatments are renal replacement therapies. The onset of the precipitating event is unpredictable, and in many instances once patients are admitted to the hospital, injury has already occurred. Improving recovery from injury therefore presents an attractive opportunity for intervention, but to date, no therapies are available that are effective if administered post injury. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate and follows a well-defined cellular mechanism that encompasses dedifferentiation of surviving renal tubule cells, proliferation of resulting progenitors, and repopulation of the denuded tubule. This sequence of events, together with their respective molecular markers, is conserved between humans, mouse, and zebrafish. During regeneration, transcription factors normally expressed during organogenesis (e.g.,lhx1a, pax2, and pax8) are reactivated. We previously demonstrated that small molecule-mediated augmentation of endogenous Lhx1a expression can ameliorate recovery in zebrafish and mouse models of AKI. Together these data support the overall hypothesis that augmentation by small molecules of cellular programs that drive kidney repair after injury represents a novel pharmacologic approach for the treatment of AKI and associated sequelae. Using a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses Lhx1a-EGFP we have developed an artificial intelligence-based, high-content assay to quantify lhx1a expression in the living embryo. Using multivariate analysis, the assay met accepted HTS assay performance standards and was validated in three-day variability studies and a small pilot library screen. We will perform a primary HTS of 50,000 compounds from the MLPCN collection. Prioritized hits will be subjected to a fully implemented, rigorous secondary assay paradigm encompassing kidney organ development, metabolic stability, in vivo efficacy, and activity profiling in a pathophysiological relevant AKI model. At the end of these studies we will have identified functionally and mechanistically characterized in vivo chemical probes to investigate the biology of kidney injury and regeneration, some of which are expected to have features that make them suitable for development into preclinical leads. NARRATIVE Acute kidney injury (AKI) presents a dire unmet medical need with unacceptably high mortality rates and a lack of therapeutic modalities. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate that can be enhanced by small molecules. In this proposal we will perform high-content, high throughput screening for kidney regeneration in zebrafish to discover novel chemical probes to investigate mechanisms of augmented kidney regeneration after injury.",High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs,9406857,R01DK112652,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Breeding', 'Carboxylic Acids', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Fibrosis', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Liver', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Microsomes', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Bank', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Organogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Prodrugs', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Renal tubule structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tubular formation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Zebrafish', 'analog', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'kidney repair', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'organ growth', 'organ regeneration', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,351001,570146095,-0.013147130928079842
"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning. Success of the project will overcome the major technical hurdles in the use of MRI in radiation therapy and will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information.

"A Novel Informatics System for Craniosynostosis Surgery Project Summary CranioSynOstosis (CSO) is the premature fusion of one or more of cranial sutures that connect individual skull bones for kids. The estimated prevalence of CSO is one in 2500 live births and even higher. Our ultimate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS). CSO is an extremely serious birth defect that involves the premature fusion, of one or more sutures on a baby's skull. CSO, in terms of the fused suture, could be classified mainly into several types of synostosis, such as sagittal, coronal, metopic, and lambdoid. Infants with CSO may have problems with brain and skull growth, resulting in cognitive impairment. This defect may not only ruin the infant's life, but also deeply affect the infant's family. SAS, recognized as a safe, effective, and less invasive treatment method, introduced to treat the CSO. This treatment uses the force of a spring to reshape the skull in a slower manner that harnesses the growth of the skull to assist with shape change. Patient-specific spring selection is the principal barrier to the advancement of SAS for CSO because few surgeons have the experience to select personalized springs for each patient. The selection of the spring force is a crucial step in this surgical treatment, and it is dependent on the experience of the surgeon. Important factors essential in the selection of the spring force include the ages, bone thickness and the subtypes of CSO. One example is that sagittal CSO with an elongated occiput needs a stronger posterior spring, while one with no predominant characteristics typically needs a mid-range anterior and posterior spring. The current problem is that we do not have a complete objective way of classification of CSO and sagittal CSO and estimation of the spring force for the individual. Our hypothesis is that CSO and sagittal CSO can be accurately classified based on the features from sutures and head shape, and behaviors of calvarial bone tissue following virtual optimal spring force can be accurately simulated by integrating a finite element method (FEM) with statistical learning model. To test our hypothesis, we are proposing the following Specific Aim: (1) To define the eSuture Informatic system and build the database, with CT and DTI data; (2) To develop tools for image processing, segmentation, registration, quantification of sutures, and automatically categorize each patient to one catalogue of the CSO types or sagittal CSO subtype; (3) To model and estimate the optimal spring force for SAS; and (4) To validate and evaluate the eSuture system. Our system will produce a paradigm shift in CSO diagnosis and treatment. Narrative Our immediate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis (CSO) using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS).

"Development and Dissemination of MuscleMiner: An Imaging Informatics Tool for Mus DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Image evaluation of skeletal muscle biopsies is a procedure essential to research and clinical practice. Although widely used, several major limitations exist with respect to current muscle image morphometric measurement, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, retrieval, and mining procedures: 1) Although traditional morphometric parameters, such as cross-sectional area (CSA) and minimum Feret diameter, etc., serve as critical indicators for assessing muscle function, current measurements are still largely based on manual or semi-automated methods, leading to significant labor costs with large potential inter-observer variability. 2) The current archiving of muscle images is still mainy based on outdated tools such as Excel spreadsheets and computer file folders. Given a new muscle image, it is almost impossible to quickly cross-compare, visualize, query, search, and retrieve previous cases exhibiting similar image contents with comparable morphometric measures, for the purpose of either discovering novel biological co-correlations at benchside, or providing personalized diagnosis and prognosis at bedside. 3) Although a typical muscle image often contains millions of data points (pixels), in clinical practice, doctors often condense this rich information into one or two diagnostic labels and discard the rest. Novel image markers, which are not always apparent through visual inspections or not manually quantifiable, but potentially represent critical diagnostic and prognostic values for precision medicine, have not been rigorously examined. Similarly, in basic science research, only a very limited number of known measures (e.g., CSA) are considered. Some non-traditional measures, such as myofiber shapes that hold the potential to serve as new indicators of muscle functions, are not fully investigated. 4) Current muscle image analysis and searching functions are fairly low throughput. As a frontier research area, Cloud computing can handle big image data in a distributed manner by providing high-throughput computational power. However, its application to muscle images has never been explored. MuscleMiner will provide a complete suite of tools for automated image morphometric measurements, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, content-based image retrieval, bioinformatics image mining, and Cloud computing. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) Develop the automated morphometric measurement unit, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) unit, and the image archiving and visualization unit. 2) Develop the advanced bioinformatics image mining unit to assist in the rapid discovery and validation of new image markers. 3) Develop the Cloud computing unit to enable big image data processing and searching functions. Disseminate this freely available, Cloud-enabled imaging informatics system to muscle research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose to develop and disseminate an advanced Cloud-enabled imaging informatics tool - MuscleMiner. MuscleMiner will provide a complete suite of tools for automated image morphometric measurements, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, content-based image retrieval, and bioinformatics image mining. The goal of MuscleMiner is to offer a freely available and powerful tool to help all clinician and basic scienc muscle researchers in their daily work. Beyond fast, objective, reproducible, and automated morphometric measurements, the impact of MuscleMiner will be multiplied by laboratories using the CBIR and visualization units (Aim 1), bioinformatics image mining unit (Aim 2), and Cloud-computing unit (Aim 3) to deeply mine and fully utilize the rich information embedded in large collections of muscle images.",Development and Dissemination of MuscleMiner: An Imaging Informatics Tool for Mus,9542210,R01AR065479,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Cells', 'Client', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Exhibits', 'Fascicle', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Fibers', 'Muscle function', 'Myopathy', 'Pathologic', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Shapes', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'System', 'Technology', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical practice', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'frontier', 'image archival system', 'image visualization', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'personalized diagnostics', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic value', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'wasting', 'whole slide imaging']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2018,377571,188894159,-0.006706519050154674
"Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT Keratoconus is a degenerative disease of the cornea that is a major cause of reduced vision-related quality of life in the United States, often leading to corneal transplantation. Ectasia after refractive surgery is a vision-threatening complication that can occur in apparently low-risk patients despite current screening technology. The biomechanical properties of the cornea play a central role in these diseases, but diagnostics are still rooted in shape measures because doctors lack direct measures of biomechanical change. While several methods have shown early promise for addressing this gap, most require contact with or perturbation of the cornea, cannot spatially resolve biomechanical properties, or involve expensive optical systems.  To address the need for direct biomechanical measurement of the cornea and the limitations of other approaches, we introduce phase-decorrelation OCT (phd-OCT). Phd-OCT makes use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to quantify random nanoscale mobility that is related to the strength and cohesion of the cornea. Preliminary results strongly support the rationale, feasibility and potential advantages of the approach. Our objectives are: (1) to refine our method to optimize detection sensitivity and speed, and (2) to determine if the technique is clinically useful. We will achieve these objectives through the following aims: 1. To develop and validate mobility-sensitive phd-OCT for corneal imaging. Spectral-domain OCT will be used for anterior segment phase-decorrelation imaging and the analysis algorithm will be optimized. The system will be validated using phantoms and torsional rheometry. 2. To investigate the potential influence of physiological factors (intraocular pressure (IOP), hydration, and temperature). Factorial design experiments in porcine and human donor globes will establish the sensitivity of phd-OCT measurements to potential confounders. 3. To develop and validate data acquisition and processing methods to enable clinical testing. GPU processing and machine learning will be configured to minimize processing time. Scan patterns will be optimized to minimize scan time and return clinically useful data. 4. To assess feasibility and preliminary diagnostic performance of clinical mobility-sensitive OCT imaging of the cornea. A first-in-human study will characterize repeatability and test the hypotheses that phd-OCT mobility measurements are increased in the region of a LASIK flap and decreased in CXL.  Expected Outcomes: The proposed studies will establish a new, non-contact method for imaging corneal biomechanical properties with the potential to address many shortcomings of current and emerging methods. Success could lead to earlier detection of of ectasia risk and allow more appropriate timing and customization of corneal treatments. Future integration of data into computational models has the potential to greatly impact the field by driving a shift from empirical planning and risk analysis to patient-specific strategies. The mechanical properties of the cornea, the transparent front of the eye, are important for diseases that affect vision as well as for corrective treatments like crosslinking therapy and LASIK. We have developed a new optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based method to detect and map corneal mechanical properties that has advantages that may make it readily translatable to clinical use. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether this technique is clinically feasible and useful by refining the technology, testing it in animal and human donor corneas, and performing studies in patients with corneal conditions of interest.",Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT,9427452,R01EY028667,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cornea', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Laser In Situ Keratomileusis', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'computerized data processing', 'crosslink', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'mechanical properties', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NEI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,400000,197030888,-0.003001954813098228
"Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The uveitides are a collection of ~30 distinct diseases characterized by intraocular infection. Each disease has its own features, course, treatment, and prognosis. Traditionally, the uveitides have been grouped by the primary anatomic site of inflammation as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. However, there are substantial limitations to this ""lumping"" of diseases. For example, among the posterior uveitides, some (e.g. toxoplasmic retinitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis) are infectious and require treatment with antimicrobial/antiviral agents, some are chronic, presumed immune-mediated diseases that require immunosuppression (e.g. birdshot chorioretinitis, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis), and a few are self-limited, spontaneously-remitting diseases with a good prognosis (e.g. acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome). As such precise diagnosis is critical for research, including epidemiology, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease specific clinical trials. Classification criteria are a type of ""diagnostic"" criteria used for reserch purposes. Although classification criteria seek to optimize sensitivity and specificity, when a trade-off is required, they emphasize specificity in order to ensure that a homogeneous group of patients is being studied. A precise phenotype is required particularly for genomic risk factor studies of complex disorders and translational pathogenesis research, as inclusion of other diseases with different risk factors and disease mechanisms would confound the results. Currently there are no widely-accepted and validated classification criteria for any of the uveitides. Preliminary data indicate ""fair to moderate"" agreement at best on the independent diagnosis of any one case by uveitis experts (κ's 0.27-0.40), but the ability of committees to reach agreement on the diagnosis of >98% of cases. The goal of the ""Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides"" project is for the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group to develop classification criteria for the 25 leading uveitides using a formal, rigorous approach. There are 4 phases to the project: 1) informatics, to develop a standardized terminology; 2) case collection, to develop a preliminary database of ~250 cases of each disease; 3) case selection, to select at least 150-200 cases of each disease that are generally accepted to be the disease (using formal consensus techniques) from the preliminary database into a final database; and 4) data analysis, using machine learning approaches, of the final database to develop a parsimonious set of criteria for each disease that minimizes misclassification. The informatics and case collection phases of the Project are complete. The case selection phase is well underway and uses online voting and consensus conference calls to achieve supermajority acceptance on all cases included in the final database. The goals of this application are to complete case selection and data analysis and develop classification criteria for the 25 of the major uveitides. These results are crucial to future clinical research i the field of uveitis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Collectively, the uveitides are the 5th leading cause of blindness in the U.S., and the cost of treating them is estimated to be similar to that of treating diabetic retinopathy. Because uveitis occurs in all age groups, including children and working-age adults, there is a greater potential for years of vision lost than with age- related diseases. Clinical research in the field of uveitis has been hampered by diagnostic imprecision and a lack of widely-accepted and validated classification criteria, the development of which is the goal of this application; these criteria are needed urgently to advance epidemiology, genomic research, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease-specific clinical trials.",Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides,9472335,R01EY026593,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior uveitis', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Choroiditis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intermediate Uveitis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nomenclature', 'Outcomes Research', 'Panuveitis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pigments', 'Posterior Uveitis', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Retinitis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'United States', 'Uveitis', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Voting', 'age group', 'age related', 'aging population', 'antimicrobial', 'birdshot chorioretinitis', 'cost', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web page', 'working group']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2018,418408,415711940,0.0014226070147043855
"Daily Immune Monitoring in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating condition characterized by profound, chronic fatigue that is not alleviated by rest, as well as pain, post-exertional malaise, and impairments in memory and concentration. ME/CFS affects over one million women in the United States, causing significant distress and loss of function in affected individuals and a significant financial burden on society Because the underlying pathophysiology of ME/CFS is not well-understood, there are no effective treatments developed specifically for the condition, and many patients are unsatisfied with existing treatment options. Previous research provides a strong case for inflammatory involvement in ME/CFS, though no immune factors have been consistently predictive of fatigue across studies. Conventional cross-sectional research approaches may not be sufficiently sensitive for identifying ME/CFS biomarkers in cases of low-level or atypical inflammation. We have observed that women with ME/CFS demonstrate considerable day-to-day variability in their fatigue severity, and this variability may reflect rapid shifts in underlying disease mechanisms. By viewing the daily fatigue variability as an important signal, and collecting blood samples daily, we have identified a small set of serum cytokines that are strongly correlated with changes in ME/CFS 1fatigue. In this proposed study, we plan to confirm our preliminary findings of immune-fatigue relationships in a larger sample. We will collect blood samples for 25 consecutive days in 70 women with ME/CFS, as well as 20 healthy controls and 20 active fatigue controls (individuals with hypothyroidism). Blood samples will be analyzed for 51 different immune factors associated with inflammation. In addition, participants will submit daily reports of fatigue severity on handheld computers. By analyzing fatigue scores and cytokine concentrations longitudinally, we can identify cytokines that ""track"" day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. This approach will allow us to develop a physiological profile that distinguishes high fatigue days from low fatigue days, providing important information about ME/CFS mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will develop a physiological model that uses serum cytokine levels to accurately predict day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. In Aim 2, we will define important ME/CFS subgroups based on cytokine-fatigue relationships. In Aim 3, we will develop a temporal pathway between immune factors and fatigue that identifies early drivers of fatigue. Additionally, we will develop a specimen bank of blood samples that can be made available to other interested researchers. Intensive longitudinal immune monitoring is a unique approach to understanding ME/CFS pathophysiology. Biomarkers revealed by this research will serve as tools in the development of ME/CFS diagnostic tests, and will provide excellent targets for developing improved therapies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a debilitating and poorly understood condition that affects over one million women in the United States. Our goal with this project is to identify biological targets that will allow better treatments for chronic fatigue to e developed. Our unique approach for discovering biomarkers involves monitoring fatigue and immune factor concentrations on a daily basis.

"Assess and Model the Health Effects, Population, and Infrastructural Vulnerabilities of Power Outage PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Climate change will lead to more intense and longer-lasting extreme weather events, such as floods, hurricanes, and severe storms, which will lead to more frequent power outage (PO). Significant gaps remain in our understanding of the impact of PO on human health: most previous studies were based on self-reported survey data, which is subject to reporting bias. In addition to weather factors that directly affect human health, other concurrent factors such as PO may also mediate with extreme weather on health, for which research is also lacking. Few studies assessed both power infrastructures and population vulnerabilities, and compared the effects of different PO causes. Furthermore, no health prediction models have been developed for PO. To fill these knowledge gaps, the proposed study will build upon multiple ongoing/ completed studies to: 1) assess the effects and mediating pathways of PO on electricity-dependent health outcomes, co-morbidities, and nursing home transfers; 2) identify infrastructure, environmental, and population vulnerabilities (individual and community); and 3) develop a vulnerability index and prediction model. We will effectively link the accessible New York statewide hospital admission and emergency department (ED) visit data with the existing data on PO, weather, air pollution, census, and nursing home transfer data. The associations between PO causes, frequency, duration, or area coverage of PO and electricity-dependent hospitalizations or ED visits due to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dialysis, water-/food-borne diseases, injury, and carbon monoxide poisoning will be assessed through Bayesian spatial-temporal model. This advanced technique will be able to control for both socio-demographic differences by regions and multiple temporal variables simultaneously. To improve scientific rigor, we will use control days (without PO and extreme weather) to separate PO from weather effects, and control diseases (e.g. appendicitis) to examine temporal changes of disease reporting. To understand PO’s natural direct and indirect effects, causal mediation analysis will be used. Furthermore, new variable selection methods, including Sure Independence Screening and Generalized Additive Model Selection will be used to screen and select predictors highly associated with outcomes. A composite vulnerability index weighed by risk factors identified and vulnerability maps will be developed. We will establish PO and PO-related health predictive models using the state-of-the-art data mining techniques, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Tree, and Ensemble Learning Decision Tree model. The excellent team with multidisciplinary and experienced investigators, numerous already collected and geocoded datasets, innovative data mining and analysis methods, continuation of student training, and successful prior partnerships with government agencies will maximize the probability of our success and feasibility. This project will also significantly enhance our institute’s environment and students’ involvement in research, and our findings will identify evidence-based strategies for emergency management and public health preparedness. NARRATIVE The proposed study will evaluate whether frequency, duration, coverage, and certain causes of power outage (PO) are associated with increased risks of electricity-dependent diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dialysis, water-/food-borne diseases, injury, and carbon monoxide poisoning. This may be the first study to assess whether people with certain demographic characteristics (e.g. elderly or different sex), living in a neighborhood with certain vulnerabilities (e.g. high land coverage or low hospital density), in certain seasons, degree of urbanicity, or specific causes of PO are more vulnerable to the impact of PO. The findings, vulnerability index and maps, and the forecast models derived from this study will help guide the state or federal environmental and health agencies to plan interventions and climate adaptation programs.","Assess and Model the Health Effects, Population, and Infrastructural Vulnerabilities of Power Outage",9440510,R15ES028000,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Appendicitis', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Carbon Monoxide Poisoning', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Climate', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electricity', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Equipment Failure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Floods', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Geographic Factor', 'Government Agencies', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hurricane', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Disasters', 'Neighborhoods', 'New York', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Seasons', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Trees', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Water', 'Weather', 'Work', 'base', 'climate change', 'climate impact', 'data mining', 'density', 'disorder control', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'extreme heat', 'foodborne', 'forest', 'health data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'low socioeconomic status', 'member', 'modifiable risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'screening', 'sex', 'student training', 'success']",NIEHS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT ALBANY,R15,2018,443750,9804373,-0.0670859838221167
"Big data in acute renal rejection PROJECT SUMMARY  Background: Acute rejection of renal transplant, i.e., the immunological response of the human body to a foreign kidney, is the main cause of dysfunction in renal transplant patients, surpassing acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and immune drug toxicity. Over 650,000 patients in the US have end-stage renal disease and renal transplant offers the best outcome for these patients. However, 15%-27% of renal transplant patients have ARTR within 5 years, which if not detected and treated promptly, causes renal damage and leads to renal failure of the transplanted kidney. Currently, ARTR is initially evaluated using blood tests and urine sampling, e.g., plasma creatinine and creatinine clearance. However, these indices have low sensitivity, since a significant change in creatinine levels is only detectable after the loss of 60% of renal function. ARTR diagnosis requires renal biopsy (gold standard), which is invasive, takes a week for diagnosis, and costs up to $20,000. Further, needle biopsy is prone to over- or under-estimation of inflammation. The proposed study seeks to develop and validate a new noninvasive computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) software system that can provide highly accurate (over 97% accuracy) diagnosis of ARTR at an early stage by integrating laboratory-based biomarkers (e.g., creatinine clearance (CrCl) and serum plasma creatinine (SPCr)) with imaging-markers that will be extracted from either dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) or diffusion- weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI).  Objective/Hypotheses: The primary objective of this proposal is to develop and validate a clinically usable system for the early detection of acute renal transplant rejection (ARTR) based on testing the following three hypotheses: (i) The perfusion of the contrast agent in the cortex of the rejected kidney is slower than the perfusion of the contrast agent in the non-rejected kidney; (ii) The estimated apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in the cortex of the rejected kidney is smaller than the estimated ADC in the cortex of the non-rejected kidney; and (iii) Fusing laboratory-based biomarkers (e.g., CrCl and SPCr) with imaging-markers that will lead to novel fused indices for distinguishing rejected versus non-rejected kidneys in clinical decision-making.  Specific Aims: (i) Develop a software CAD system for early detection of acute renal transplant rejection based on integrating/fusing the estimated physiological perfusion parameters from DCE-MRI data with laboratory-based biomarkers for both rejected and non-rejected transplanted kidneys; (ii) Develop a software CAD system for early detection of acute renal transplant rejection based on integrating/fusing the estimated physiological diffusion parameters from DW-MRI data with laboratory-based biomarkers for both rejected and non-rejected transplanted kidneys; and (iii) Evaluate the accuracy of the proposed image analysis software system with clinical data that will be collected at University of Louisville (Approved IRB # 16.0041), University of Michigan (Approved IRB # HUM00115031), and the collected MRI data at The Kidney transplant center at Mansoura University with local regulatory approval.  Study Design: We will develop the following image analysis techniques to accurately analyze both DCE- MRI and DW-MRI: (i) segmentation of the kidney object from the surrounding abdominal structures for either DCE-MRI or DW-MRI using appearance and prior shape models; (ii) a Laplace-based non-rigid registration approach to handle local deformations in the kidney region caused by physiological effects (e.g., intrinsic pulsatile effects, breathing, or transmitted effects from adjacent structures, such as the bowel) during the data collection; (iii) segmentation of the kidney cortex and generation of either the physiological perfusion parameters (e.g., wash-in slope, wash-out slope, time-to-peak, and peak value) or physiological diffusion parameters (e.g., ADC); (iv) classification of the acute rejection versus non-rejection kidney status and evaluating the method as a diagnostic test; and (v) depiction of parametric maps of the estimated perfusion or diffusion indices to help clinical visual assessment of the transplanted kidney. The MRI and clinical data will be obtained from patients who have undergone kidney transplantation from live donors, and are available to our research team via Dr. Beache and Dr. Dwyer (Radiology Department and The Kidney Transplant Center at the University of Louisville, respectively) and Dr. Samaniego-Picota (Director of the Kidney Transplant Program and the Transplant Ambulatory Care Unit at the University of Michigan). In addition to the data that will be collected at the University of Louisville and the University of Michigan, our group has access to MRI data that had been collected from an additional 100 subjects at Mansoura University Hospital, Egypt. This data is available to our group through Dr. Abou El-Ghar, one of the PI collaborators, and it will be used to test the proposed CAD system on the data collected from another geographical area. Our preliminary diagnostic results, based on analysis of DCE-MRI data from 54 independent in-vivo cases using leave-one-subject-out approach were 98% accurate (sensitivity = 100.00%, specificity = 96%, and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) = 98%). Moreover, our preliminary results, based on the analysis of DW-MRI data from 75 independent in-vivo cases using leave-one-subject-out were 97% accurate (sensitivity = 98%, specificity = 96%, and DSC = 98%). These results demonstrate the potential of the proposed CAD system to complement current technologies such as nuclear imaging and ultrasonography to determine the type of kidney dysfunction post transplantation.

"Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction Project Summary We propose a novel way of reconstructing medical images rooted in deep learning and computer vision that models the process how human radiologists are using years of experience from reading thousands of cases to recognize anatomical structures, pathologies and image artifacts. Our approach is based on the novel idea of a variational network, which embeds a generalized compressed sensing concept within a deep learning framework. We propose to learn a complete reconstruction procedure, including filter kernels and penalty functions to separate between true image content and artifacts, all parameters that normally have to be tuned manually as well as the associated numerical algorithm described by this variational network. The training step is decoupled from the time critical image reconstruction step, which can then be performed in near-real-time without interruption of clinical workflow. Our preliminary patient data from accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions suggest that our learning approach outperforms the state-of-the-art of currently existing image reconstruction methods and is robust with respect to the variations that arise in a daily clinical imaging situation. In our first aim, we will test the hypothesis that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition. In the second aim, we will answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications. Finally, we will perform a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee. We will compare our proposed approach to a clinical standard reconstruction. Our hypothesis is that our approach will lead to the same clinical diagnosis and patient management decisions when using a 5min exam. The immediate benefit of the project is to bring accelerated imaging to an application with wide public-health impact, thereby improving clinical outcomes and reducing health-care costs. Additionally, the insights gained from the developments in this project will answer the currently most important open questions in the emerging field of machine learning for medical image reconstruction. Finally, given the recent increase of activities in this field, there is a significant demand for a publicly available data repository for raw k-space data that can be used for training and validation. Since all data that will be acquired in this project will be made available to the research community, this project will be a first step to meet this demand. Project Narrative The overarching goal of the proposal is to develop a novel machine learning-based image reconstruction approach and validate it for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The approach is able to learn the characteristic appearance of clinical imaging datasets, as well as suppression of artifacts that arise during data acquisition. We will test the hypotheses that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition, answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications, and validate our approach in a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee.",Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction,9521289,R01EB024532,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Step training', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'patient population', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,471965,329565273,0.0023510628614580196
"Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images Abstract Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness among US adults between the ages of 20 and 74 years. Laser photocoagulation surgery has been established as an effective way of treating retinopathy if it is detected early. Yearly retinal screening examinations are a potent tool in the battle to reduce the incidence of blindness from diabetic retinopathy because they provide diabetic patients with timely diagnoses and consequently, the potential for timely treatment. Primary care safety net clinics provide monitoring and other services for diabetic patients but they are often not equipped to provide specialty care services such as retinal screenings. Access to specialists who can provide retinal screenings can be increased through the use of telemedicine, which has shown great promise as a means of screening for diabetic retinopathy in the US and internationally. A pilot study by Charles Drew University investigators had a total of 2,876 teleretinal screenings performed for diabetic retinopathy, with 2,732 unique diabetic patients from six South Los Angeles safety net clinics screened. The present study aims to build on this prior work by: (a) developing novel software that utilizes information from clinical records to detect latent diabetic retinopathy in diabetic patients who have not yet received an annual eye examination, and (b) devising methods to speed up the diabetic retinopathy detection process for diabetic patients who have had digital retinal images taken by partially automating the process using image processing and machine learning techniques. Specifically, we propose to: 1. Develop predictive models for diabetic retinopathy using risk factors collected from patient clinical records. 2. Develop predictive models for automated diabetic retinopathy assessment using a combination of patient  risk factor data and data from digital retinal images previously evaluated by experts. 3. Evaluate the predictive accuracy of: a) the models developed for specific aim 2, and, b) the assessments of  optometrist readers against standard of care dilated retinal examinations by board certified  ophthalmologists for 300 diabetic patients utilizing a new Los Angeles County reading center. 4. Create web-based software tools based on the predictive models developed in specific aim 1 that can be  used to initiate outreach to high-risk patients in under-resourced settings, boosting detection rates for those  patients who are most at risk for diabetic retinopathy. 5. Establish targeted outreach methods to promote screening for patients that the predictive models from  specific aim 1 identify as potentially having undetected diabetic retinopathy. Narrative Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness among US adults between the ages of 20 and 74 years. Although previous studies within the US and internationally have shown that teleretinal screening can increase access to eye examinations for detecting retinopathy, few studies have focused on the US urban safety net, which has ophthalmic screening rates that are well below the US average and a preponderance of diabetic patients who are from ethnic minority groups. Building on a previous teleretinal screening study that assessed 2,732 South Los Angeles patients for retinopathy, this study deploys machine learning and image processing techniques to detect latent retinopathy in unscreened diabetic patients and partially automate the diabetic retinopathy detection process for teleretinal screening.",Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images,9566291,R01LM012309,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alaska Native', 'American Indians', 'Asian Americans', 'Blindness', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'County', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Eye', 'Glucose', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Insurance', 'Health care facility', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'International', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Optometrist', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Services', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Telemedicine', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'care systems', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'ethnic minority population', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'inner city', 'laser photocoagulation', 'medical specialties', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outreach', 'patient screening', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'racial minority', 'randomized trial', 'retinal imaging', 'safety net', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend']",NLM,CHARLES R.

"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will make it possible for a wide community of researchers who collect and analyze medical imaging data to take advantage of a new class of computer algorithms that very accurately label and measure anatomical structures and pathological formations in medical images. By offering more accurate image-derived measurements, the project promises to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, reduce the costs of biomedical re- search studies and pharmaceutical trials, and accelerate scientific discovery.",Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation,9547416,R01EB017255,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Myocardium', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aortic valve', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'multi-atlas segmentation', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted imaging', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,597688,593605914,-0.0039083035635572305
"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart transplant (Tx) surgery is a well-established life-saving procedure, but is associated with post- interventional risks such as acute cardiac rejection (ACR) which is one of the leading causes of death in the first year after transplant. Beyond the first year, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the single greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality. Monitoring the patient for post-transplant events is thus paramount. The standard monitoring strategy, however, relies on frequent (12-16 monitoring nodes during year 1 alone) invasive and costly procedures including endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) and catheter angiography. Since EMB and catheter angiography have limited sensitivity due to sampling errors (ACR) or the diffuse nature of the disease (CAV), a reliable non-invasive alternative for the early detection of ACR and CAV would be desirable to reduce the need for invasive procedures, improve sensitivity, and reduce cost. We have recently developed and applied cardiac MRI techniques for the non-invasive assessment of myocardial edema (T2-mapping), diffuse fibrosis (pre- and post-contrast T1-mapping), myocardial velocities (tissue phase mapping), and microvascular quantitative perfusion. We have shown that these techniques can identify distinct regional structural and functional alterations in the heart that correlate with te status of the allograft. Based on these findings, a detailed cost-effective analysis using Markov modeling and decision tree analysis has demonstrated that cardiac MR has tremendous potential to reduce monitoring costs by 40-50% during the first year after Tx alone. This proposal builds on these promising findings and our aim is to develop an new 15-minute structure-function cardiac MRI protocol for the improved detection regional abnormalities associated with ACR (edema, fibrosis, dysfunction) and CAV (perfusion, dysfunction). Integration of MRI with echocardiography and intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) will provide unique multi-modality assessment of the allograft. The application in a longitudinal clinical study coupled with state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis will allow redefining the most effective post-Tx mixed monitoring strategy. The aim is to to help clinicians identify the optimal mixed monitoring strategy, i.e. the optimal combination of multi-modality imaging (structure-function MRI, echo, IVUS) and invasive procedures (EMB, catheter angiography) which provide best outcome (quality adjusted life days) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop a multi-modality imaging protocol for the non-invasive characterization of tissue and function of the left and right heart in patients after heart transplantation. Our aim is to develop a new non- invasive 15 minute diagnostic test in order to provide a previously unattainable quantitative characterization of myocardial structure-function deficits in cardiac transplant patients. The application in a longitudinal clinial study coupled with cost-effectiveness analysis and decision tree modeling will allow to improve current monitoring strategies by combining cardiac MRI, echocardiography, intravascular ultrasound and invasive tests (biopsy, catheter angiography) to provide the best outcome (quality of life days, mortality) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient.",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,9417961,R01HL117888,"['Acute', 'Allografting', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost utility', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrosis', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Myocardial', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling Errors', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'base', 'comparative cost effectiveness', 'cost', 'extracellular', 'follow-up', 'heart allograft', 'heart function', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'post intervention', 'procedure cost', 'public health relevance', 'standard of care', 'two-arm study']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,658634,367414121,0.011722462868359476
"Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):1 Of all markers of human health, the most intuitive is body shape but based on quantitative evidence.  2 Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio  3 (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality  4 risk than body mass index (BMI). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can quantify regional adiposity in  5 more detail than the above measures but is underutilized for many reasons including potential harm from  6 ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments  7 in the ""quantified self movement"" to better describe phenotypes of body shape and its relation to metabolic  8 risks. The candidate developed in this proposal is 3D optical whole body scanning. If successful, sophisticated  9 obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with 10 disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment 11 technology. Whole body 3D imaging technology is already so accessible that it can be done with video games 12 such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect, and consumer cameras. 13 The long term goal of the Optical Body Shape and Health Assessment Study is 1) to provide phenotype 14 descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in 15 research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive 16 models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, 17 muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat), and then show how our 3DO body composition estimates are 18 associated to important metabolic risk factors. Our central hypothesis is that 3DO measures of body 19 composition with shape classification better predict metabolic risk factors than anthropometry or DXA body 20 composition alone. Our specific aims are: 1. Identify the unique associations of body shape to body 21 composition indices in a population that represents the variance of sex, age, BMI, and ethnicity found 22 in the US population; 2. Describe the precision and accuracy of 3DO scans to monitor change in body 23 composition and metabolic health interventions; and 3. Estimate the level of association of 3DO to 24 common health indicators including metabolic risk factors by gender, race, age, and BMI. In an 25 exploratory aim, we investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct 26 predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class 27 Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self- 28 assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US 29 population, and how these models relate to important metabolic status and body composition. The positive 30 impact will be the immediate applicability to clinicians and individuals for personalized risk assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of who is at high risk of metabolic diseases because of a poor metabolic profile. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults.

"Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification Project Abstract Motivation: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 500 million people. Children commonly develop CKD from urinary obstructive diseases and nephrotoxic therapies, and then suffer severe growth failure, hyper- tension, cardiovascular risks, and neurocognitive deﬁcits, and eventually end-stage kidney disease. Accurate renal function quantiﬁcation will improve clinical management of hydronephrosis (1 in 100 babies) and dos- ing/selection of chemotherapeutic regimens in oncology patients. Glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR), the biomarker of renal function, is derived from blood or urine tests. These tests only provide global GFR and are limited in accuracy, especially in children, and even more so in children with cancer. MRI offers superb anatomic delineation without ionizing radiation, and is thus ideal for pediatric kidney imaging. However, MRI has not been widely adopted for pediatric renal function evaluation due to lack of reliability and cumbersome workﬂow. These hurdles stem from the fact that the critical components required for global and regional GFR calculation, including high spatiotemporal resolution, plasma ﬂow and arterial input function, are difﬁcult to obtain, and that accurate image segmentation of kidneys (cortex and medulla) is labor intensive. Additionally, although the same contrast agent injection can be used for obstruction evaluation, certain areas of the kidney suffer from signiﬁcant signal loss using standard MRI acquisition techniques due to high contrast agent concentrations. This project addresses these major challenges for automated comprehensive renal function evaluation in children. Approach: The project has three development aims, which are validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable novel free-breathing time-resolved 3D dynamic contrast enhanced MRI that simultaneously provides accurate GFR calculation and renal plasma ﬂow. This is achieved by incorporating self-navigated motion compensation, fast acquisition with parallel imaging and compressed sensing, and phase-contrast ﬂow imaging. The second aim is to develop multiple new image analysis methods to extract GFR and renal plasma ﬂow (RPF) that lever- age novel ﬂow data of Aim 1, as well as automated new machine-learning image processing techniques for the segmentation of kidneys and ultimately global and regional GFR calculation. In Aim 3, we will develop and integrate ultrashort-echo-time techniques to address the MRI signal loss due to T2* effects from high contrast concentration for patients with obstruction, and further incorporate motion compensation and accelerated imag- ing methods to enable time-resolved high-resolution dynamic MRI for contrast washout kinetics analysis in the same MR exam. Aim 4 will determine the performance of these methods in a clinical setting. Signiﬁcance: This work will lead to robust, automated comprehensive pediatric renal MRI for safer and more accurate renal function evaluation in children. The techniques will facilitate widespread application in the com- munity setting and permit robust evaluation of renal function, for both children and adults. Project Narrative Kidney diseases in children often stem from blockages of the urinary tract or toxicity from medications, such as antibiotics or chemotherapies. Kidney function quantiﬁcation is crucial for clinical management of these children.

"Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization Project Summary Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most diagnosed form of non-cutaneous cancer in US men. The selection of patients who require immediate treatment from those suitable for active surveillance currently relies on non- specific and inaccurate measurements. A method that allows clinicians to more confidently discriminate clinically relevant from non-life-threatening tumors is needed to improve patient management. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is the preferred non-invasive imaging modality for characterizing primary PCa. However, its accuracy for detecting clinically significant PCa is variable. We propose to address this limitation by combining mpMRI with positron emission tomography (PET) with a PCa-specific radiotracer and using advanced multimodal machine learning models (i.e. radiomics and deep learning) to characterize tumor aggressiveness based on the imaging data. Recently, scanners capable of simultaneous PET and MR data acquisition in human subjects have become commercially available. An integrated MR-PET scanner is the ideal tool for comparing MR and PET derived image features to identify those that provide complementary information and build a hybrid PET-mpMRI model that most accurately identifies clinically significant tumors. While this novel technology allows the acquisition of perfectly coregistered complementary anatomical, functional and metabolic data in a single imaging session, a new challenge needs to first be addressed to obtain quantitatively accurate PET data. In an integrated MR-PET scanner, the information needed for PET attenuation correction (AC) has to be derived from the MR data and the methods currently available for this task are inadequate for advanced quantitative studies. We have formed an academic-industrial partnership to accelerate the translation of multimodal MR-PET machine learning approaches into PCa research and clinical applications by addressing the AC challenge and validating machine learning models for detecting clinically significant disease against gold standard histopathology in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Specifically, we will: (1) Develop and validate an MR-based approach for obtaining quantitatively accurate PET data. We hypothesize that attenuation maps as accurate as those obtained using a 511 keV transmission source – the true gold standard for PET AC – will be obtained; (2) Identify the multimodal radiomics model that most accurately predicts PCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that the diagnostic accuracy of this approach will be superior to that offered by the stand-alone modalities; (3) Evaluate radiomics and deep learning approaches for predicting pPCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that machine learning approaches will achieve a higher predictive accuracy when applied to data acquired simultaneously than sequentially. Project narrative A better method to non-invasively characterize primary prostate cancer is needed to improve patient management. Extracting additional information from multimodality quantitative MR-PET data using machine learning approaches is expected to result in better diagnostic performance. In this work, we propose to accelerate the translation of quantitative MR-PET to prostate cancer research and clinical applications. In particular, we will develop and validate an MR-based attenuation correction approach to guarantee that quantitatively accurate PET data are obtained in an integrated MR-PET scanner and then use machine learning approaches to characterize the aggressiveness of the tumors in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.",Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization,9524253,R01CA218187,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Death Rates', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Histopathology', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kinetics', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prostate', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone imaging', 'cancer classification', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'men', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'radiotracer', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tumor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,684119,551214295,-0.0854738995086018
"Shape up! Kids Project Summary/Abstract Of all markers of pediatric health, the most intuitive is body shape. Human and animal studies indicate that weight loss/gain correlates closely with increasing/decreasing insulin sensitivity, respectively. Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality risk than pediatric body mass index Z-score. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can quantify regional adiposity in more detail than these measures but is underutilized for many reasons including the sensitivity to children to ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments in optical technology to better describe phenotypes of pediatric body shape and its relation to metabolic risks (obesity, “failure to thrive”) and bone density and size. If successful, sophisticated obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment technology. The long term goal of the Shape Up! Kids Study is 1) to provide pediatric phenotype descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat) and bone mineral density (BMD) over a wide range of ages (5 to 18 years), weights and heights, stratified by sex, and ethnicity. Our central hypothesis is that optical estimates with shape classification of soft tissue composition and bone density better predict fracture and metabolic risk factors than anthropometry (WC, WHR, and BM) alone. The Investigators will highly leverage existing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Bone Mineral Density in Children Study. Our specific aims are: 1) Identify the unique associations of body shape to body composition and bone density indices in a pediatric population that represents the variance found in the US population, 2) Describe the precision and accuracy of optical scans to monitor change in body composition, bone density, 3) Estimate the level of association of optical scans to common health indicators including metabolic risk factors. Our exploratory aim is to investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self-assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US pediatric population, and to define how these models relate to important metabolic status indicators.

"Automated image-based biomarker computation tools for diabetic retinopathy Abstract  In this SBIR project, we present EyeMark, a set of advanced image analysis tools for automated computation of biomarkers for diabetic retinopathy (DR) using retinal fundus images. Specifically, we will develop tools for computation of microaneurysm (MA) ap- pearance and disappearance rates (jointly known as turnover rates) for use as a bi- omarker in quantifying DR progression risk along with longitudinal analysis of other DR lesions. The availability of a reliable image-based biomarker will have high positive influ- ence on various aspects of DR care, including screening, monitoring progression, drug discovery and clinical research.  Measuring MA turnover and longitudinal analysis of DR lesions involves two labor in- tensive steps: careful alignment of current and baseline images, and marking of individual lesions. This process is very time consuming and prone to error, if done entirely by human graders. The primary goal of this project is to overcome these limitations by automating both the steps involved in longitudinal analysis: accurate image registration, and lesion identification.  We have designed and developed a MA turnover computation prototype tool that ro- bustly registers longitudinal images (even with multiple lesion changes) and effectively detects DR lesions (lesion level AUROC>=0.95). The tool provides graceful degradation to confounding image factors by reporting MA turnover as a range, thereby capturing the inherent confidence in MA detection. By the end of Phase IIB we will develop a market ready, clinically validated end-to-end desktop software for robust, automated longitudinal lesion analysis and characterization that can work on the cloud to produce results in near constant time (for large datasets), and also provide intuitive visualization tools for clinicians to more effectively monitor DR progression. Narrative The proposed tool, EyeMark, will greatly enhance the clinical care available to diabetic retinopathy (DR) patients by providing an automated tool for computation of an image- based, reliable, DR biomarker in a non-invasive manner. This will enable identification of patients who are at higher risk to progress to severe retinopathy, thus helping prevent vision loss in such patients by timely intervention. Early identification is especially important in face of long backlog of diabetic patients waiting for an eye examination, and the fact that 90% of vision loss can be saved by early identification. The availability of an effective biomarker will also positively influence the drug discovery process by facilitating early and reliable determination of biological efficacy of potential new therapies.",Automated image-based biomarker computation tools for diabetic retinopathy,9622980,R44TR000377,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Exudate', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Services', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lesion', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Microaneurysm', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pear', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'cloud based', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diabetic patient', 'digital imaging', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'fundus imaging', 'high risk', 'high throughput analysis', 'image registration', 'improved', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'macula', 'medical schools', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'response', 'retinal imaging', 'screening', 'screening program', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'validation studies']",NCATS,"EYENUK, INC.",R44,2018,750000,1300000,0.004460817738714061
"Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure. Finally, WUSM will make a clear institutional commitment to maintain its Clinical Site, to adapt UDN Phase I practices for sustainability, to contribute to formation of a sustainable national UDN resource, and to adapt to unique needs and unexpected circumstances that may arise once Common Fund support ends in fiscal year 2022. 2.0 PROJECT NARRATIVE Undiagnosed diseases in children and adults represent frustrating and costly challenges for patients, families, physicians, and society. Building on established institutional infrastructure similar to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) will establish a UDN Clinical Site to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases, facilitate research into the etiology of undiagnosed diseases, and promote an integrated and collaborative community across multiple UDN Clinical Sites, Sequencing Cores, Model Organisms Screening Centers, and among laboratory and clinical investigators. Specifically, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will annually recruit, select, evaluate, and follow 30 participants with disorders in any clinical specialty, adult and pediatric, provide comprehensive clinical evaluations that require <5 days and follow up, and participate in all UDN protocols, data management and sharing, and sustainability planning.",Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site,9593059,U01HG010215,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accreditation', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Physicians', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Secure', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'network models', 'operation', 'outreach', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'student training', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,750000,533594881,-0.003027232731578353
"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more. This will be accomplished by: optimizing the image processing that is used, further developing new and better image processing methods, and developing a method of ""personalized imaging"", in which, for each individual patient, the minimum amount of imaging agent needed to obtain a good image is computed.",Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging,9476341,R01HL122484,"['3D ultrasound', '4D Imaging', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Protection', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radioactive', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'computer program', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging agent', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'perfusion imaging', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,770494,8894636,0.005546937946612407
"Handheld ultrasound system for real-time thoracic epidural analgesia guidance PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) is the gold standard for treating acute pain following major thoracic and abdominal surgeries and in patients with fractured ribs. Of the 51 million inpatient surgeries performed in the US each year, an estimated 3 - 6 million are eligible for TEA. Multiple randomized control trials have demonstrated significantly improved patient outcomes when receiving TEA instead of systemic opioids, including reduced 90-day mortality (3.1 vs 4.9%), improved postoperative pain control, reduced pulmonary and cardiovascular complications, and reduced incidence of chronic pain syndromes. In addition, TEA is associated with increased patient satisfaction, shortened hospital stays, and a significant reduction in the cost of perioperative care (e.g. savings between $4,675 - $22,000 per patient vs systemic opioids). However, TEA is regarded as one of the most technically difficult procedures executed by anesthesiologists, in large part because epidural needle placement is guided by manual palpation of spinal bone landmarks followed by “blind” needle insertion. Palpation of spine landmarks is unreliable for identifying the epidural space (i.e. 30% accuracy) and results in high TEA failure rates (15 – 35%) due to catheter misplacement outside of the intended epidural space. Halving the number of TEA failures per year is estimated to reduce the number of postoperative deaths by 25,000 per year and result in a $15.5B/yr economic benefit due to reduced cost of care and fewer premature deaths.  During the Phase I project, the feasibility of a low-cost, handheld ultrasound system and new automated image guidance technologies was demonstrated by imaging in vitro thoracic spine phantoms and human thoracic spines. This Phase II proposal seeks funding to support the continued development of a low-cost, handheld medical device for thoracic epidural guidance. The key technological innovations of this project are focused on improvements to ultrasound-based beamforming for enhanced bone visualization and include a new spinal bone imaging approach that enables the automatic detection of spinal bone landmarks and needle insertion site. The long-term goal of this project is to demonstrate a portable, low-cost, ultrasound-based medical device that facilitates thoracic epidural placement in the postoperative patient population, improves success rates, and lowers the risk of associated health complications.  The Phase II hypothesis is that the handheld medical imaging device and associated technologies increases first-attempt epidural analgesia success rates, defined as successful epidural administration on the first needle insertion attempt. New ultrasound beamforming technologies for a low-channel count ultrasound transducer design for improved bone imaging performance will be designed, fabricated, and tested. In addition, ultrasound imaging technologies central to this project will be optimized, integrated into the new device, and validated in a clinical study. Finally, the Phase II hypothesis will be directly tested in an 80 patient clinical study. With an estimated 3 – 6 million patients eligible for thoracic epidural administration each year, the estimated US market size for the proposed device is $325 M/yr. PROJECT NARRATIVE Thoracic epidural analgesia is the current standard of care for postoperative pain management following thoracic or abdominal surgery. Failures occur at high rates due to a reliance on manual palpation of bone landmarks to guide needle placement, which results in numerous adverse events: incomplete analgesia, increased mortality, higher pain scores, headache, dural puncture, back pain, parathesia, and paralysis. The long-term goal of this project is to demonstrate a portable, low-cost, ultrasound-based medical device that facilitates thoracic epidural placement, improves success rates, and lowers the risk of associated health complications.",Handheld ultrasound system for real-time thoracic epidural analgesia guidance,9475793,R44GM123791,"['Abdomen', 'Absence of pain sensation', 'Acute Pain', 'Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Back Pain', 'Cadaver', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catheters', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Chest', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Assisted', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Epidural Analgesia', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Headache', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Length of Stay', 'Lung', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Imaging', 'Needles', 'Nerve Block', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pain management', 'Palpation', 'Paralysed', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative Care', 'Phase', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Puncture procedure', 'Randomized', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Resolution', 'Rib Fractures', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Spinal', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic epidural analgesia', 'Time', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'bone', 'bone imaging', 'bone visualization', 'care costs', 'chronic pain', 'commercial application', 'commercialization', 'contrast enhanced', 'control trial', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'epidural space', 'human imaging', 'image guided', 'imaging approach', 'imaging platform', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'inpatient surgery', 'instrument', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pain score', 'patient population', 'portability', 'premature', 'standard of care', 'success', 'technological innovation', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,"RIVANNA MEDICAL, LLC",R44,2018,793271,670777,-0.10741612621303669
"Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Although cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are relatively rare causes of heart failure (HF), they are particularly challenging to detect and treat for several shared reasons: (1) on routine clinical imaging (i.e., echocardiography [echo]), they can be difficult to distinguish from superficially similar, more common forms of cardiac disease that cause left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy; (2) the diagnoses are often missed and thus patients can present late in the course of disease at a time when treatment is difficult; (3) objective, noninvasive metrics that reliably reflect disease progression have not been identified; and (4) the small number of known patients with these diseases can make epidemiology studies and clinical trials difficult to organize and conduct. For both cardiac amyloidosis and HCM, echo plays a critical role in both diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring given its ubiquitous clinical availability, safety, and low cost. More broadly, echo dominates the current landscape of routine cardiac imaging, with tens of millions of echos performed in the United States each year. However, the clinical challenges described above highlight several shortcomings of echo: it is limited in its ability to (1) diagnose disease at its early stages; (2) discriminate between morphologically similar diseases; and (3) quantify disease progression. This proposal seeks to address deficiencies in the current echo reading workflow, which is subjective and captures only a small fraction of the data available in each study. The overall objective of this application is to use advances in machine learning to develop and validate fully-automated echo image analytic approaches to diagnose and track rare cardiomyopathies, focusing on cardiac amyloidosis and HCM. Our proposal is centered on the hypothesis that highly scalable computer vision methods can be applied to echo studies to overcome limitations of the standard clinical echo reading workflow. Accordingly our aims are: (1) Apply an automated method for echo quantification and disease identification to detect and differentiate cardiac diseases that cause increased LV wall thickness; and (2) Characterize quantifiable echo measures of disease progression in cardiac amyloidosis and HCM and associate these with clinical outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team, which is composed of experts in cardiomyopathies, echocardiography, computer vision, and machine learning, will analyze echos and patient data from 2 large patient registries: the Multicenter Amyloid Phenotyping Study (MAPS) and the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) HCM Network, with validation using a repository of nearly 400,000 echos. The successful completion of our aims will result in an innovative tool for early diagnosis of myocardial diseases and tracking of disease progression. Importantly, our project will set the stage for conducting larger epidemiology studies of rare myocardial diseases by automating the identification of these patients, and thereby developing previously unattainable broad-based cohorts for these conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis (due to abnormal deposition of a protein into the heart muscle) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to a genetic mutation) are important causes of heart failure and sudden death in the general population. These heart diseases are difficult to diagnose, monitor, and treat because: (1) they appear superficially similar to more common forms of heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure) on imaging tests; (2) the optimal monitoring of disease progression over time has not been established; and (3) there is a lack of large-scale studies of patients with these diseases given their rarity. This project aims to use machine learning (artificial intelligence) of digital echocardiographic images to create a completely automated method for diagnosing and tracking these rare heart diseases with the ultimate goal of broad deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms in hospitals and clinics to help identify patients with these rare heart diseases earlier, better predict adverse outcomes, and increase the size and scope of patient registries to enhance research of these conditions.",Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases,9614825,R01HL140731,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloidosis', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Face', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Two-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital', 'disease diagnosis', 'epidemiology study', 'heart imaging', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'particle', 'patient registry', 'repository', 'response', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2018,826025,685608202,0.01597419283032129
"RetiVue DR, a point and shoot, non-mydriatic, widefield retinal camera for diabetic eye screening Project Summary Over the past two decades, diabetic retinopathy (DR) has become the leading cause of adult blindness in the US, affecting 40% of all diabetic patients and resulting in $500 million a year in direct medical costs. Vision loss due to DR is largely preventable and can be reduced by up to 90% with appropriate eye screening. However, in the US, less than 50% of diabetic patients receive a recommended yearly eye exam due to many factors that include lack of access to eye care professionals. Distributed tele-ophthalmic screening thru primary care clinics can potentially provide all diabetic patients cost- effective, yearly evaluations to detect DR and prevent vision loss. However, gold-standard sensitive detection of DR using standard retinal photography is complex and cumbersome process requiring up to 7 images per eye. This screening process cannot for all practical purposes be achieved without having highly trained ophthalmic photographers. RetiVue proposes to develop the RetiVue DR in collaboration with Olympus, to create the first handheld, non- mydriatic, 160 field of view, widefield DR screening camera. It will allow single photo capture of an area up to ten times greater than conventional fundus cameras, allowing sensitive detection of DR at its earliest time points. Full integration of RetiVue and Olympus hardware will enable the most advanced and highest image quality handheld retina camera on the market. Use of automated alignment, auto laser focus, and auto image capture will allow complex imaging of the retina to be performed simply by positioning the iris, requiring no user knowledge of retinal anatomy. We have established clinical proof of concept with our patented technology, but require several additional innovations in optical design, automated image recognition, and retinal image processing to enable a commercial device. We will for this proposal optimize our alignment system and laser based focusing system for widefield imaging, allowing automated alignment and focus to image the retina before eye movement occurs. We will develop a new method of widefield, non-mydriatic peripheral retinal imaging using multiple LED slit-beam projectors to allow rapid, segmental, sequential image capture of 90°, 120°, and 160° FOV on diabetic patients. Finally, we will create the most advanced retinal image processing algorithms to remove Purkinje haze which prevents conventional cameras from imaging beyond 45° FOV and enable seamless stitching of segmental peripheral retina images into a single widefield image. Project Narrative Diabetic retinopathy is a blinding eye disease that affects millions of people with diabetes and costs the US $500 million a year in medical costs. Loss of vision can be prevented if diabetic patients undergo yearly eye screening that examines the retina to detect this disease, but currently less than 50% of diabetics do so. At Re- tiVue LLC, we are designing the first easy to use handheld eye camera to allow primary care doctors to take DSLR quality pictures of the eye to look for diabetic retinopathy. Our eye camera will see 5 times more of the retina than any other handheld camera, ensuring that we find diabetic retinopathy when it first occurs. Earlier detection of diabetic retinopathy will give diabetic patients the best chance to keep their vision long term, and avoid unnecessary blindness.","RetiVue DR, a point and shoot, non-mydriatic, widefield retinal camera for diabetic eye screening",9564677,R44EY028484,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus photography', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Iris', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Legal patent', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Masks', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Photography', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Pupil', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'TNFRSF10B gene', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Validation', 'Visible Radiation', 'Vision', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detector', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'image processing', 'imager', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laptop', 'lens', 'novel', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'retinal imaging', 'sample fixation', 'screening', 'seal', 'sensor', 'success']",NEI,RETIVUE,R44,2018,847697,634231,0.017951697522037773
"Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disrupted circadian timing has emerged as a serious health and safety issue, yet there are no objective means of easily assessing circadian timing or alignment without performing a highly controlled, multiple-day in- patient study. Altered circadian timing can cause both sleep loss and sleepiness, cause performance errors such as motor vehicle accidents, and impair memory/learning. Thus, despite the obvious need to recognize an individual's circadian phase/alignment, we cannot assess circadian timing clinically or in retrospective studies. Not surprisingly, the first goal of the 2011 NIH Sleep Disorders Research Plan is to identify: ""...metabolic... biomarkers of sleep deficiency and biological timing...and circadian disorders that will facilitate personalized treatments, and clarify the risk associated with untreated sleep and circadian disorders and disturbances."" We are aware that major challenges face biomarker development, including multi-factorial causes of metabolite shifts normally controlled across multiple time-points. Because circadian time is associated with profound metabolic, immune and cardiovascular changes, however, we hypothesize that a biomarker signature for circadian phase derived from -omic markers can be obtained from a single blood sample. We therefore propose to utilize the analytical and bioinformatics platforms and experience in population-level metabolomics studies in the PIs lab to study banked plasma samples from the well-characterized individuals in six tightly controlled circadian rhythm studies run by the four co-investigators.The Aims are:  Aim 1: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and t cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics-  based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples drawn from three constant routine protocols Aim 2: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and to cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples  drawn from four forced desynchrony protocols  Aim 3: To systematically evaluate the validated profiles from Aims 1 and 2 and their mathematical  similarities and differences so as to improve accuracy and precision of the biomarkers  Aim 4: To test the markers identified above under poorly controlled real world applications Identification of biomarker panels will impact multiple aspects of science and health: (i) contribute to clinical recognition and treatment on circadian disorders; (ii) advance personalized medicine through individualized treatment timing to enhance efficacy/reduce side effects of medications (e.g., chemotherapy); (iii) creating epidemiologic tools to relate circadian with disease risk; and aiding development of other disease biomarkers, and; (iv) contribute to research on circadian biology and its implications for human health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to identify blood-based markers that can inform a clinician or researcher about an individual's internal biological clock. At the broad levels of society and public health research, the work has the potential direct benefit of identifying individuals with ""off-set"" clocks (enabling diagnosis and potential therapy), increasing accuracy and precision of studies of blood lipids, facilitating understanding of certain sleep disorders, increasing understanding of the role of biological clocks in chronic disease processes (e.g., cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease), and potentially improving the administration of certain pharmaceuticals, eg, chemotherapy agents.","Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting",9457491,R01HL132556,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Clocks', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Disease', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Drowsiness', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Memory impairment', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Strigiformes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker identification', 'biomarker panel', 'blood lipid', 'blood-based biomarker', 'chemotherapy', 'combinatorial', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'human population study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'men', 'metabolomics', 'personalized medicine', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'real world application', 'tool', 'vehicular accident']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2018,863172,327644200,-0.0029128369126422593

"An automated and massively scalable platform for organismal and developmental genetics Project Summary Sleep regulation plays a critical role in proper neurological development. During sleep, there is enhanced synaptic plasticity in the nervous system in addition to often extensive neural remodeling. Although we know that sleep regulation is important to neurological development, many aspects of sleep regulation are poorly understood. In particular, the mechanisms of how we compensate for missed sleep in future sleep cycles are mysterious, despite general knowledge of how circadian rhythms are established. It is likely that these mechanisms involve neuropeptide signaling in the brain. However, current tools to study the roles these peptides play in sleep homeostasis, even with the use of simple model organisms like C. elegans, are low- throughput, qualitative, and subjective. In order to study sleep-like behavior in C. elegans, there is an unmet need for a tool for continuously monitoring and perturbing long-term behavior of the worm, as well as an automated and un-biased method for quantifying behavioral data. In this proposal, we will first develop the enabling technology, and use it to identify the roles of neuropeptides in homeostasis of the nematode’s sleep- like state. In Aim I, we will engineer and validate a scalable microscopy platform for monitoring and perturbing C. elegans behavior, decreasing the cost of long-term candidate screens by ~ 100 fold. In Aim 2, we will quantify behavior of wild-type animals via an automated and bias-free quantitative analysis to establish baseline behavior and prioritize behaviors that are linked to sleep homeostasis. In Aim 3, we will use the technology developed in Aims I and 2 to quantify differences in behavior of C. elegans neuropeptide mutants using a candidate approach. Because of the strong preliminary data we have gathered so far and the experience of the sponsor’s laboratory, this proposed work is likely to identify the roles of these candidate neuropeptides in sleep homeostasis, contributing to our mechanistic understanding of sleep regulation. Furthermore, the tools we develop for this particular study will also have broad utilities in many other problems, such as developmental programming, aging, and neurobehavioral studies. Project Narrative Sleep regulation plays a critical role in proper brain development and is linked to a variety of neurological and behavioral disorders. In particular, how animals correct for interrupted sleep cycles in future cycles could lead to therapeutic targets, but apart from a few implicated neuropeptides, little is known about the mechanisms behind this aspect of sleep. The objective of this proposal is to identify the roles of neuropeptides in sleep homeostasis by screening C. elegans mutants for behavioral defects.",An automated and massively scalable platform for organismal and developmental genetics,9396432,F31GM123662,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Characteristics', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Interruption', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Middle Insomnia', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropeptides', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Reproduction', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Study models', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'age related', 'behavioral study', 'circadian pacemaker', 'cost', 'developmental genetics', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mutant', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurobehavioral', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'sleep regulation', 'software development', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2017,44044,45341731,-0.01219535288934141
"Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (MiEED) PROJECT SUMMARY In this application, I am requesting support from a career development award to support my research proposal titled “Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction”. I will be undertaking this work with the mentorship of Dr. Jeffrey Gordon (Primary US mentor) at the Washington University, St Louis and Dr. Asad Ali (Primary LMIC mentor) at the Aga Khan University. This project builds on our existing studies of Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED), funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The current application aims to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of EED by studying the evolution of gut microbial configuration in children who have clinical and histological evidence of EED. EED is common in children living in impoverished conditions with limited access to clean drinking water and sanitation. Histopathological changes of EED in small bowel mucosa include alteration in crypt to villous ratio along with lymphocytic infiltration of the villous epithelium and lamina propria. Although studies involving biopsies of small bowel mucosa are critical to study EED, these studies are uncommon because of logistic challenges involving performing endoscopies in field settings in LMICs. We have previously demonstrated in an ongoing BMGF funded study that we are able to safely obtain such biopsies, we now have a unique opportunity to study the relationship between gut microbiome evolution and EED in this cohort. The central hypothesis of the current application is that children with histological confirmation of EED have shared features of a bacterial community which is different from healthy controls and non-EED subjects, and that such changes in bacterial configuration are associated with enteric and systemic inflammation. For testing these hypotheses, evaluation of gut microbiome in healthy and stunted children will be carried out to identify the age discriminatory bacterial taxa in children with and without confirmation of EED. Dr. Gordon will be providing mentorship and experience in gut microbiome and microbiota analysis. Dr. Ali will provide the needed infrastructure of the field site and laboratory facilities, along with linking the microbiome analysis with clinical and histological outcomes of interest. The Aga Khan University is a leading regional research institute with multiple support systems for junior investigators which will be vital for my career transition as an independent scientist. My long term goal is to be the principal investigator of my own laboratory, focusing on studying the gut microbiome and its relationship with communicable and non-communicable diseases. I envision working on microbiota derived therapy for EED, and to find targets in the inflammatory pathways driven by changes in gut homeostasis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Globally, Pakistan has the third highest rate of stunting among children aged < 5 years. Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED) is proposed to be a critical factor responsible for chronic growth faltering in children in resource limited settings. This research utilizes an innovative approach to study a program of postnatal gut microbiome development in children and its impact on child growth. This proposal will provide an ideal training platform for a translational scientist, covering the domains of mucosal immunology, histopathology, computational analysis, microbiome analysis and host immune responses. The skills learnt from this project will be critical for the capacity development of both the LMIC institution and the candidate herself.","Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (MiEED)",9402123,K43TW010697,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Bangladesh', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Career Mobility', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Duodenum', 'Endoscopy', 'Enteral', 'Epithelium', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Height', 'Histologic', 'Histopathologic Grade', 'Histopathology', 'Homeostasis', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Impairment', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Institution', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lamina Propria', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Milieu Therapy', 'Modeling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Pakistan', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Small Intestines', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Sustainable Development', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Villous', 'Washington', 'Weight', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cytokine', 'drinking water', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'forest', 'global health', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'immune activation', 'immune function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intestinal villi', 'laboratory facility', 'learning strategy', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'rRNA Genes', 'skills', 'translational scientist']",FIC,AGA KHAN UNIVERSITY (PAKISTAN),K43,2017,57663,282635,-0.029851111826985303
"QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tissue identification and quantification plays a significant role in the study of aging and age-related diseases. For example, the accumulation of fat in the human body and its regional distribution with aging is associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Changes in muscle composition are strongly linked to decline of muscle strength, decreased mobility caused by aging, or musculoskeletal disorders. Especially interesting is analysis of longitudinal changes of morphometric descriptors that is significant for studying the aging process and for the diagnosis and prevention of age-related diseases.  Medical imaging has emerged as a major tool for estimation of body composition mainly due to being non- invasive and producing multi-dimensional information. Nowadays MRI and CT acquisition is a central component of clinical trials. An abundance of imaging data is collected, but this wealth of information has not been utilized to full extent. Therefore research on image analysis techniques for tissue quantification that are reproducible and can be used on large-scale clinical trials is of particular importance.  The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse body composition data from modern MRI and CT imaging. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that qualitative body composition phenotypes on clinical imaging will differentiate individuals who are healthy versus those who are not. The goal of our work is to provide a foundation for image analysis of the abdomen and lower extremities and to study the relationship between body morphological changes and age-related pathologies.  We will build upon recent advances in medical image computing to segment muscle, regional adipose tissue, and bone in clinical CT and MRI scans. We will also develop image registration procedures to achieve intra- and inter-subject correspondence and make efficient use of information provided by multi-modal and multi-temporal imaging data collected in clinical trials (aim 1). After these methods have been developed, we will address the hypothesis that quantitative use of clinical imaging can increase the prognostic accuracy of age-related pathologies (aim2). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age-related diseases such as type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and sarcopenia have become a worldwide epidemic and affect the quality of life of millions. To give a global perspective, roughly 343.8 million people in the world have type-2 diabetes today, and 175 million don't know they have diabetes at all. Metabolic diseases are strongly linked to longitudinal changes in body composition, morphology and function. This project will contribute novel and non-invasive medical image analysis techniques for studying the human body composition and its changes with increasing age to achieve timely prognosis of these pathologies.",QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES,9244841,SC3GM113754,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delaware', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Techniques', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age related', 'biophysical model', 'bone', 'clinical imaging', 'disease diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'morphometry', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'reduced muscle strength', 'sarcopenia', 'statistics', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY,SC3,2017,63883,4139254,0.007253671986119038
"Multidimensional MRI-based Big Data Analytics to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This “Pathway to Independence” award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position. Ultimately, she aims to become a faculty member in a radiology or bioengineering institute, where she can further research technical biomedical imaging and machine learning developments applied to the musculoskeletal system. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morphological and compositional MRI quantifications are widely used tools to detect early cartilage degeneration and to study disease progression of osteoarthritis, a complex and multifactorial disorder.

"Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 award will support my development as an independent investigator with a translational research program that specializes in the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Candidate: My research experience as a cognitive neuroscientist ideally positions me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise on the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative disease. I have strong cognitive training with an M.Sc in Psycholinguistics and Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where I was supported by an NRSA Individual Predoctoral Award. During my postdoctoral IGERT fellowship at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I was awarded an NRSA Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship Award to investigate the role of decision-making in language. In this research I have gained experience investigating neurodegenerative disease patients comparatively in order to obtain converging evidence to complement fMRI studies of healthy adults. I have become increasingly interested in translating my research to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. I was recently award the Society for the Neurobiology of Language Postdoctoral Merit Award in recognition of my novel research investigating how social limitations in patients contribute to difficulty in discourse. I have committed to four years of clinical research the NIH Loan Repayment Program, and I intend to commit to clinical research for the duration of my career. I have learned that cognitive and neuroimaging studies provide only one perspective on neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal, I plan to gain the necessary expertise in biological aspects of FTLD and related conditions to complement my past experiences, and thus achieve my goal of becoming a multifaceted independent investigator with expertise in the cognitive and biological basis for neurodegenerative diseases. With the support of this K01, I will develop expertise to conduct investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, and neuropathological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. I will ultimately integrate the biological expertise gained in this proposal with language studies from my cognitive neuroscience research in an effort to identify non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to screen patients for clinical trials and to measure the efficacy of disease-modifying agents. Environment: This award will be conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Neurology, the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR), and the Penn Bioinformatics Center where I have strong institutional support. The proposed institution is an exceptional environment that has expert centers for neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, a leading genetic research core, expert neuropathology, outstanding biostatisical support, and relevant clinical research laboratories. The University of Pennsylvania is unique in comparison to other institutions in the country because all of the above methods are available in one center. My mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentor, Dr. John Trojanowksi, have international reputations for neurodegenerative disease research. My career development will also be supported by my co-mentor, Dr. Lyle Ungar, who has extensive expertise in statistical learning algorithms and in the analysis of proteomic and genomics datasets. Together, this mentorship team will facilitate my development as an independent investigator by providing access to existing and future collaborators, laboratory resources, and exceptional training environments. The CNDR is a world- leading center for neurodegenerative disease research with human and animal models of disease and exceptional translational science. Biofluid biomarker experience is extensive, and several national biofluid cores are centered at Penn (e.g. ADNI). There is a wealth of internationally-recognized neuroimaging expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Imaging and Computer Science Laboratory, and I will benefit by integrating neuroimaging resources from these facilities with other modalities of biomarker research. Training: I will develop my expertise in the biological basis of neurodegenerative disease with the support of my mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentors, Dr. John Trojanowski and Dr. Lyle Ungar. Specifically, with Dr. Trojanowksi I will engage in training related to biofluid and genetic biomarkers of FTLD. I will develop advanced neuroimaging skills and cutting-edge biostatistical methods with Dr. Ungar. Each of these training modalities will be supported by complementary formal coursework, participation in seminars, attendance of conferences, and regularly scheduled meetings with mentorship team. Research: FTLD is a neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 15 out of 100,000 individuals. In recent years detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have demonstrated distinct sources of histopathological abnormalities in FTLD, including the presence of tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). However, there are currently no in vivo methods for discriminating between FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. There is an urgent need to improve the in vivo diagnosis of FTLD to appropriately enter patients into emerging clinical trials, and to develop sensitive and specific endpoints in trials that can quantify response to these treatments. The overall research aim of this proposal is to develop multimodal methods to improve in vivo diagnosis of FTLD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) affects approximately 15 out of 100,000 adults. Detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have identified two distinct sources of histopathological changes that contribute to FTLD. However, there are currently no in vivo methods for diagnosing pathological subtypes of FTLD. There is an urgent need to identify in vivo diagnosis methods to facilitate the identification of appropriate patients to enter into emerging disease-modifying drug treatment trials. The overall aim of this project is to identify multimodal biomarkers of FTLD.",Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration,9279038,K01AG043503,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Comparative Study', 'Complement', 'Country', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Fellowship', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Foundations', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Research', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Proxy', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Psychology', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Training', 'Transact', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive training', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'genome wide association study', 'gray matter', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'longitudinal course', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'pre-doctoral', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'social', 'symposium', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'translational research program', 'treatment response', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2017,128358,593605914,-0.00040268900601256416
"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life. This research will also provide quantitative outcome measures that may be used in future clinical trials.",Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS,9312144,K01HD088762,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Equilibrium', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'FXTAS', 'Family', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuroepidemiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Posture', 'Predictive Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'data management', 'design', 'disability', 'disabling symptom', 'epidemiology study', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'gait examination', 'improved', 'instrument', 'male', 'men', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'sensor', 'sex']",NICHD,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2017,130380,55098220,-0.007462296008268733
"Rule Based Semantics and Big Data Based Methods for Early Identification of Patients at Risk of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represent a major global public health problem, with an ICU incidence of 10.4% and an associated mortality rate of 35-45%. Early detection of ARDS is essential for appropriate application of Lung Protective Ventilation, the only therapeutic intervention demonstrated to improve mortality in mechanically ventilated patients with established ARDS. In response to this need, tools that electronically monitor ABG results and interpret radiology reports of CXR findings for evidence of ARDS criteria in mechanically ventilated patients have been developed and deployed in critical care settings. Although these tools have been sufficiently accurate to detect ARDS, they fail to detect early stages of disease progression, prior to full-blown ARDS development, in at risk patients. Recent initiatives are focused on tools to identify patients in very early stages of ARDS before wide-spread alveolar damage has occurred, enabling strategies focused on prevention of ARDS development. Among efforts to use EMR data to reliably identify patients at high risk of developing ARDS, the most notable are the Lung Injury Prediction Score (LIPS) and the “early acute lung injury” score (EALI). Validation studies show these promising tools have discriminating performance with an area under ROC curve (AUC) in the .7-.8 range, and demonstrate risk detection early in the course of illness, well in advance of frank respiratory failure. Our vision is to build on these efforts, and derive a highly automated early identification algorithm based on routinely captured medical record data that reliably and accurately identifies trajectories associated with post-exposure to specific classes of risk factors that predicts patients at risk for development of ARDS with an AUC discrimination in excess of .95. We believe the predictive performance of existing ARDS screening tools can be significantly improved by: 1) combined use of highly specific/sensitive cognitive/explanatory models to help guide machine learning by reducing “label noise” and identifying specific risk-induced trajectories associated with progression to ARDS; 2) exploring a full constellation of predictive risk factors not yet addressed by earlier efforts; 3) use of advanced natural language processing technology to extract ARDS risk information from free text clinical reports, and 4) use of enhanced machine learning algorithms that are label noise tolerant and combine the predictive power of nonparametric algorithms with the feature interpretability associated with parametric techniques. Despite advances in critical care medicine, mortality among patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) remains high, up to 45% for severe cases. There is no proven pharmacological treatment for ARDS; current treatment approaches focus on providing supportive care. Consequently, there is great community interest in targeted prevention of ARDS. The goal of this research is to develop and validate a highly predictive real-time ARDS surveillance software system that can be routinely used in hospitals to detect early stages of this syndrome, enabling interventions that can reduce the progression to full-blown disease. Our approach uses modern artificial intelligence techniques including cognitive reasoning, machine learning and natural language processing to dramatically reduce preventable ARDS mortality in hospitalized patients.",Rule Based Semantics and Big Data Based Methods for Early Identification of Patients at Risk of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS),9345675,R43HL135909,"['Acute Lung Injury', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Algorithms', 'Alveolar', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Berlin', 'Big Data', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'ICD-9', 'Immune response', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Noise', 'Nurses', 'Onset of illness', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Physiological', 'Pneumonia', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Secondary to', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Supportive care', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'base', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder risk', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'lung injury', 'mortality', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'screening', 'software systems', 'syndromic surveillance', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,"COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2017,149470,0,-0.0061842046121391
"Optimizing electrical impedance myography outcomes through data mining Project summary  Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a non-invasive technology for the assessment of muscle that is based on the application of a weak, high frequency electrical current to a muscle and the measurement of the resulting surface voltages. The further development and application of EIM remains the main business focus of Skulpt, Inc, a small business concern based in Boston and San Francisco (Specific Aims just say San Francisco). Alterations to the condition of the muscle, including myocyte atrophy, fat and connective tissue deposition, and inflammation all alter the EIM data in predictable and consistent ways. To date, through Skulpt, EIM has been applied as a potential biomarker for assessing disease progression and response to therapy in a wide variety of neuromuscular disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and spinal muscular atrophy, as well as other disorders that impact muscle condition, such as disuse atrophy and sarcopenia (age related muscle loss); over 1000 people have been studied with Skulpt’s EIM technology. Whereas the results of these applications are promising, the analytic approaches taken to the data sets have been fairly basic, utilizing only simple single frequency or simplistic multifrequency values. However, with every single muscle measurement, over 240 individual data points are acquired at different frequencies, different depths of muscle penetration, and at different angles to the major muscle fiber direction. Moreover, each of the above studies has been done in isolation, and thus how results differ between diseases is unknown. Given the plethora of data, applying more sophisticated analytic approaches has the potential of yielding improved EIM measures. Moreover, collaborators have already collected an associated wealth of animal EIM data that will help further inform this analysis. Thus, in this proposed Phase 1 SBIR, we plan to apply a variety of data mining techniques to the vast set of data already accumulated at Skulpt, Inc such that improved EIM outcomes can be developed and implemented. In Specific Aim 1, we will study human data across all disease types evaluated to determine which data sets are most effective at discriminating diseased from healthy muscle as well as distinguishing between diseases. In Specific Aim 2, we will focus on finding the metrics that are most sensitive to the degree of muscle pathology in a specific disease. In both of these aims, we will evaluate how these new metrics are mirrored in already obtained animal data. In Specific Aim 3, we will study these metrics in a new set of data (a test set) that was not used to develop the analytical paradigms so as to ensure their robustness. With the conclusion of this work, we will plan to pursue a Phase 2 SBIR that will focus on the development of a software suite to assist in EIM data interpretation based upon these results followed by a prospective observational clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of these newly developed metrics for disease diagnosis and tracking of progression/response to therapy. Project Narrative  Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a non-invasive technology for the assessment of muscle that remains the main focus of Skulpt, Inc. Considerable EIM data has already been collected in a variety of neuromuscular diseases. In this study, the investigators plan to perform a more detailed analysis of all data collected to date (so-called “data mining”), such that improved EIM outcomes can be developed that will be applied to future studies.",Optimizing electrical impedance myography outcomes through data mining,9466075,R43AR073114,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Back Pain', 'Boston', 'Businesses', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Connective Tissue', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease remission', 'Disuse Atrophy', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glycogen storage disease type II', 'Health', 'Inclusion Bodies', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Technology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Cells', 'Muscle Fibers', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Myography', 'Myopathy', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neuromuscular conditions', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Radiculopathy', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Work', 'animal data', 'base', 'commercialization', 'data mining', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'electric impedance', 'human data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'neuromuscular', 'potential biomarker', 'prospective', 'response', 'sarcopenia', 'voltage']",NIAMS,"MYOLEX, INC.",R43,2017,149998,869698,-0.006465960659927934
"HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research DESCRIPTION:   My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator who harnesses biomedical Big Data Science for the investigation of multilevel influences on health. To continue my progress towards this goal, I am proposing to build the infrastructure to establish a neighborhood data repository, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers and policy makers. I am a highly trained researcher in social epidemiology and quantitative analyses, particularly large health surveys. Before coming to Utah, I worked as a full-time statistical programmer/data analyst on a NIH-funded project to evaluate the health effects of a large neighborhood relocation policy experiment on low-income families in five cities. Our study results suggested that moving from high- to lower poverty neighborhood is related to reductions in obesity and diabetes and improved mental health. Other extant research has provided evidence on associations between the neighborhood environment and mortality and morbidity-even after adjusting for individual characteristics. Poor access to healthy food, fast food chains, the lack of recreational facilities, and higher crime rates all correlate with hiher obesity rates. Nonetheless, the dearth of neighborhood data, especially measures of neighborhood quality that are consistent across geographic areas, limits neighborhood effects research. Moreover, neighborhoods are not only defined by their resources, but also by the social interactions and activities of people who live there. The widespread usage of the internet and open recording of many transactions has led to the availability of massive amounts of data that permits capture of previously hidden micro-level interactions. We will build the data algorithms and infrastructure to harness relatively untapped, cost efficient, and pervasive social media data to develop neighborhood indicators such as food themes, healthiness of food mentions, frequency of exercise/recreation mentions, metabolic intensity of physical activities, and happiness levels. The creation of HashtagHealth requires the use and refinement of Big Data methods to perform data mining, processing and storing of heterogeneous, unstructured data. We will build a testable version of HashtagHealth for the state of Utah and then apply the data resource to the examination of neighborhood effects on young adult obesity. My rigorous training and previous research experiences in social determinants of health, causal inference, and data analyses uniquely prepare me to make significant contributions to the field of Big Data, particularly at the intersection of public health and social sciences.  My Specific Aims are: 1) to develop a neighborhood data resource, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers, 2) to develop Big Data techniques to produce novel neighborhood quality indicators (e.g., healthiness of food mentions, frequency and type of exercise/recreation and happiness levels), and 3) to utilize HashtagHealth and individual-level data from the Utah Population Database to investigate neighborhood influences on obesity among young adults. My mentorship team includes experts in biomedical research (Drs. Ken Smith, Jim VanDerslice), computer science (Dr. Feifei Li), and statistics (Dr. Ming Wen). My team has the breadth of expertise to help me obtain critical multidisciplinary skills and successfully implement my research aims. In addition to my research aims, my Specific Career Development Aims include the following: 1) to develop expertise in data mining and database systems, 2) to acquire training in natural language processing and machine learning, 3) to further gain knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), 4) to develop expertise in study design and analysis of neighborhood effects, and 5) and to develop grant writing and research management skills to lead future projects. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to successfully compete for R01 funding to create a national neighborhood data repository and to investigate national patterns of neighborhood effects on obesity. This proposal makes significant, relevant contributions to the field because 1) neighborhood environments are increasingly linked to important health outcomes, and 2) this project addresses the limits to research resulting from the lack of neighborhood data by providing new, cost-efficient data resources and methods for characterizing neighborhoods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic rise in obesity and related chronic diseases in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. My overarching career goal is to contribute to the improvement of population health by conducting research in social determinants of health and developing new methodologies to address multidimensional research questions. The development of the Hashtag Health data repository will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of social media data to capture social and cultural processes with potential impact on health.",HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research,9528113,K01ES025433,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Communications Media', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Food Chain', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Politics', 'Population Database', 'Poverty', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'big biomedical data', 'built environment', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fast food', 'food consumption', 'health data', 'improved', 'lower income families', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'news', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'social media', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'walkability', 'young adult']",NIEHS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",K01,2017,155914,58406802,-0.004051781545304218
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,9279027,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'CCL26 gene', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Standardization', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'illness length', 'immunoreactivity', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'trial design', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2017,156324,507546965,-0.021467823945147596
"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs. The proposed novel approaches are expected to advance precision medicine approaches to SUDs by enabling treatment matching and a more refined SUD classification to gene finding.",Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data,9224405,K02DA043063,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurobiology', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol use disorder', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cocaine use', 'contingency management', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'genetic association', 'genomic data', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'opioid use disorder', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,K02,2017,163452,36067938,-0.035659782620202654
"Low Cost Mobile Platform for Pulmonary Disease Screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary disease (including primarily asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), pneumonia, lung cancer, and tuberculosis) is an increasingly large portion of the global health burden. Developing countries with large low-income populations are disproportionately affected, due to increased risk factors (e.g. biomass cooking stoves) as well as poor access to health care and lack of affordable screening tools for early detection. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) alone is currently the third leading cause of death in the world and second leading cause of death in India after ischemic heart disease. In the younger population, pneumonia is a particular concern, being the leading cause of death for children under 5 years of age. Tuberculosis (TB) has also reached alarming proportions in India (24% of all cases worldwide). Despite this great prevalence of pulmonary disease in India, access to modern diagnostics instruments is not possible; furthermore, approximately 60% of general practice (GP) clinic doctors in India are primarily trained in Ayurvedic medicine with little or no training for diagnosing respiratory disease. As a result, many of the patients with lung disease are underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed (often confused with cardiovascular disease). As a result, there is a great need to provide health workers in India with simple tools that can be used to diagnose or screen for respiratory disease in the primary care setting. Addressing this need, our team has been developing a mobile diagnostic platform consisting of a digital stethoscope, peak flow meter, and mobile phone that can be used to screen for symptoms of lung disease and provide a guide for diagnosis. The present study extends this work and has the following aims: (1) To validate and test a low-cost mobile diagnostic platform for the purpose of identifying symptoms of lung disease and providing diagnostic guidance. (2) To assess the acceptance and usability of the mobile diagnostic platform by the local general practitioner (GP) doctors in rural India. We propose to deploy and test a low-cost mobile diagnostic platform, making use of machine learning algorithms that will detect specific symptoms of lung disease and help guide diagnosis. In the first year of the project, we shall create and train the mobile software algorithm using data collected in the field from patients (N=250) that have been previously diagnosed with specific lung diseases. Then year 2, we shall evaluate and test our mobile platform with Indian patients (N=250) recruited from four GP clinic sites in the Pune, India region. The automated mobile phone diagnosis result shall then be compared with the diagnosis from trained pulmonologists, using a traditional stethoscope as well as standard lung function testing instruments. A preliminary diagnosis and qualitative feedback shall also be collected from non-trained GP doctors using the mobile tools in order to ascertain usability and diagnostic value.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pulmonary disease is a very large public health concern in India, as well as in most developing countries. Relatively few general practitioner (GP) doctors are trained to properly diagnose pulmonary disease, and affordable tools for diagnostic support simply do not exist. This proposal seeks to validate and test the use of low-cost mobile phone-based diagnostic tools for pulmonary disease.            ",Low Cost Mobile Platform for Pulmonary Disease Screening,9356362,R21TW010245,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Ayurvedic Medicine', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Biomass', 'Bronchitis', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Cookstove', 'Data', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Feedback', 'General Practices', 'General Practitioners', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Household Air Pollution', 'India', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Modernization', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Site', 'Stethoscopes', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'cost', 'digital', 'global health', 'health care availability', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'meter', 'mobile computing', 'primary care setting', 'public health relevance', 'rural area', 'screening', 'tool', 'usability']",FIC,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2017,164421,113554200,-0.019529852335987426
"Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During medical imaging, patient motion is virtually unavoidable presenting a significant source of image degradation and artifacts, which in turn, can impact the quality of care received by many patients. One method used to address patient motion is to employ visual tracking systems (VTS), which involves placing a small number of reflective markers on the patient that can be located and tracked in 3D space using stereo cameras. The tracked markers can then be used as a surrogate to a structure of interest, such as the heart. The tracked surrogate provides a quantifiable measure that can be directly correlated with the motion of the target structure, which can then be used for prospective or retrospective motion correction. However, the markers add complexity to patient workflow, provide only a sparse sampling of the patient's surface, and the optimal number and placement of markers is unknown. This project addresses the shortcomings of marker-based VTS systems by proposing to develop and test a novel low-cost marker-less VTS system for tracking patient motion within a hybrid imaging system. The primary barrier for successfully tracking the patient's body surface using marker-less VTS is that clothing prevents an unobstructed view of the patient's body. The candidate, Dr. Lindsay, is proposing to incorporate a translational method using computational approaches to compensate for garments within the proposed marker-less VTS system. Dr. Lindsay has received training in computer science and computer vision and previously has focused on the computational aspects of capturing, modeling, and rendering of physical phenomena such as light and is proposing to extend this knowledge to the medical imaging field. Dr. Lindsay's goals for this proposal are to acquire the necessary training and skills that will allow him to translate his expertise and existing computational skills to an area f research with medical relevance: namely, detecting and tracking patient motion for the purpose of improving motion correction for hybrid- imaging. Dr. Lindsay's long-term career goal is to become an accomplished independent investigator focusing on solving significant problems in medical imaging by translating advances in Computer Science. The proposed work will take place the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (UMass) in Worcester, MA under the primary mentorship of Dr. Michael King, an internationally known expert in the area of medical imaging and medical physics in Nuclear Medicine. Drs. Gennert, Sullivan, Licho have expertise in computer vision, mechanical engineering and medical imaging, and radiology and Nuclear Medicine, respectively will also serve as co-mentors.  The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) develop a novel marker-less VTS, which we call PT- Cam, using low-cost using state-of-the-art camera technology, 2) model surface motion as a surrogate for internal motion of the heart, and 3) conduct tests of the PT-Cam system, in order to determine the acceptability and feasibility of clinical usage, on patients undergoing clinical MPI PET/CT imaging. Thus, the main objective of this program of research is to develop a clinically viable method for motion tracking patients undergoing hybrid-imaging studies by using a novel marker-less surface-tracking method that can compensate for clothing and provide modeling of interior motion of structures from surface tracking. If successful, not only will this project provide an innovative, marker-less VTS system for low-cost surface tracking for motion compensation during hybrid imaging but it will also give the candidate the necessary training needed to become an independent investigator in the medical field and potentially a leader in the field of medical imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 7.2 million people per year die world-wide from coronary artery disease (CAD), and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become a critical tool for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment of CAD. During medical imaging such as MPI, patient motion is virtually unavoidable and presents a significant source of image degradation and it has been suggested that upwards of 40% of cardiac studies in PET are effected by some type of motion with similar findings for SPECT. The proposed project will directly address the shortcomings of previous methods for tracking patient motion by developing and testing a novel low-cost marker-less visual tracking system for patient motion within hybrid imaging.",Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging,9300962,K25EB019032,"['Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Body Surface', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clothing', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Optics', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Security', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'heart motion', 'imaging study', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'perfusion imaging', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'virtual', 'visual tracking', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K25,2017,169609,294146927,0.007073570161482853
"The Role of the Microbiome in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K23 proposal will complete Robert Dickson, MD's training towards his long-term career goal of improving our understanding and treatment of lung disease by investigation of the microbiome. Dr. Dickson is a Pulmonary and Critical Care physician and scientist at the University of Michigan with established success in the burgeoning field of lung microbiome studies. This proposal builds on Dr. Dickson's previously acquired expertise in pulmonary pathophysiology and microbial ecology with new training in clinical research methods and computational biology. These established and newly-acquired skills will be integrated to improve our understanding of the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). This research will be conducted under the guidance of primary mentor Gary B. Huffnagle PhD, co- mentor Theodore J. Standiford MD and an advisory board of accomplished investigators with expertise in clinical research methods, computational biology and lung immunology as well as extensive mentoring success. This 5-year plan includes formal coursework, professional development, and progressively independent research, with defined milestones to ensure productivity and a successful transition to independence. The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expense, responsible for an estimated 74,500 U.S. deaths per year. Numerous studies have identified indirect evidence of translocation of bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the lung in patients at risk for ARDS, but to date no study has evaluated the role of microbiome in the pathogenesis of ARDS. This proposal will test the hypothesis that translocation of gut bacteria to the lung provokes the inflammation and injury of ARDS via two specific Scientific Aims. Aim 1 will determine if translocation of enteric bacteria to the lung microbiome precedes the clinical development of ARDS, and Aim 2 will determine the temporal relationship between respiratory dysbiosis, host inflammation and the clinical onset of ARDS. Inherent to completing these high-level aims, Dr. Dickson will execute a prospective cohort study of patients at high risk for ARDS, utilize modern culture-independent techniques of bacterial identification to describe the bacterial communities in the lungs and gastrointestinal tracts of high-risk patients, and apply novel techniques of advanced computational modeling to the complex nonlinear system of ARDS pathogenesis. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: 1) to determine if the lung microbiome contributes to disease progression among patients with established ARDS and 2) to determine if the lung microbiome can be therapeutically manipulated in critically ill patients to prevent or modulate respiratory disease. n addition to building a foundation for a programmatic line of research to understand the role of the microbiome in lung disease, this proposal will provide Dr. Dickson with research skills applicable to additional domains of human microbiome and ARDS research. This K23 award will equip Dr. Dickson to establish himself as an independent investigator and international leader in this promising field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expense, responsible for an estimated 74,500 U.S. deaths per year; the National Institutes of Health have identified the prevention and early treatment of ARDS as a research priority. We lack an understanding of the pathogenesis of ARDS, impeding our ability to predict and prevent its onset. Determination of the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of ARDS would both 1) improve our ability to predict the onset of ARDS, enabling targeted preventive interventions and 2) identify novel therapeutic targets at the microbiome/host interface in patients at risk for ARDS.",The Role of the Microbiome in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,9199225,K23HL130641,"['Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Alveolar', 'Bacteria', 'Catecholamines', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early treatment', 'Ecology', 'Ensure', 'Enteral', 'Enterobacter', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Epinephrine', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gammaproteobacteria', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immigration', 'Immunology', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Non-linear Models', 'Norepinephrine', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Pseudomonas', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical development', 'clinical risk', 'cytokine', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal bacteria', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'skills', 'spatiotemporal', 'success']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2017,171176,641965656,0.006429732484210478
"Improving cancer family history collection through social networking and artificial intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY  The  activities  proposed  in  this  NCI  K07  application  are  designed  to  advance  the  career  development  and  research  independence  of  Dr.  Brandon  M.  Welch.  Family  health  history  (FHx)  is  one  of  the most important  resources available to help clinicians identify disease risks. By knowing a patient's FHx, clinicians can quickly  identify  disease risks and initiate risk-reducing strategies such as increased screening, prophylactic surgery,  risk-reducing  therapeutics,  and  lifestyle  changes.  FHx  is  also  the  foundation  of  genomic  medicine.  Unfortunately,  the  collection  and  use  of  FHx  by  patients  and  clinicians  is  suboptimal.  To  improve  the  collection and use of FHx among the general population, a better FHx tool that is easier and more convenient  to  use  than  current  FHx  tools  is  needed.  A  new  FHx  web  tool,  called  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com,​  incorporates  artificial intelligence and social networking to improve user engagement with FHx collection.Utilizing artificial  intelligence  based  chat  entity  can  improve  the  collection  of  FHx  information  by  making  it  easier  and  more  engaging to record FHx information, likewise social networking allows users to tap into the collective wisdom  and  knowledge  of  the  family  to  correct  inaccuracies  and  overcome  gaps  in  FHx  knowledge.  This research  study  will  first  identify  enhancements  to  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com  ​that  will  further  promote  user  engagement,  with  particular  focus  on  rural and underserved patients (Aim 1). We will then evaluate whether this new FHx  tool can improve collection of cancer FHx in comparison with current FHx tools (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess  the impact of ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com ​on the clinical settings (Aim 3). To implement the research plan, it will be  critical  to  apply,  skills  obtained  through  K  award  learning  objectives,  namely  clinical  oncology  (learning  objective  1),  iterative  patient-centered  design  (learning  objective  2),  and  health  technology  assessment  (learning  objective  3).  To  fulfill  these  learning  objectives,  an  interdisciplinary  group  of  mentors  will  direct  a  comprehensive training plan. The training plan includes coursework, seminars, workshops, journal clubs, and  conferences,  covering clinical oncology, patient engagement, health disparities, user-centered development,  human-computer  interaction,  clinical  research  methodologies,  health  technology  assessment,  and  ethical  conduct  of  research.  The  strong  support  of  an  excellent  team  of  mentors,  and  the  vast  resources  of  the  Medical  University  of  South  Carolina,  create  an  optimal  training  environment.  Collectively,  the  integrated  learning  objectives  and  research  plan  are  critical  to  establishing  a  successful,  innovative,  and  meaningful  academic career focused on developing patient-centric informatics tools for oncology.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Family health history (FHx) is one of the most important risk factors for cancer and the foundation of genomic medicine, but is under-utilized by patients and clinicians. By incorporating artificial intelligence and social networking into a FHx tool, it will lead to greater engagement with FHx collection.

In addition, Dr. Hesheng Liu, Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and a computational neuroscientist with expertise in functional imaging, will collaborate on this project. Dr. Wang will engage in multiple career development activities to expand her ability to develop mechanistic insights about psychiatric disorders. These include new training in patient-oriented experimental research, a better understanding of the psychopathology of psychosis, and a stronger grasp of neuroanatomy. She will also receive advanced training in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Determining the disconnected neural circuits underlying psychosis has proved elusive. Dr. Wang's research project aims to reveal circuitry abnormalities in psychotic patients using a subject-specific, cross-diagnostic approach. In Aim 1, Dr. Wang will establish methods for accurately characterizing the cortical and subcortical functional connectivity networks in individual patients. In Aim 2, leveraging a cross-diagnostic cohort of psychotic patients that will be scanned using the protocol optimized for individual-level functional analyses, as well as an existing patient data set, Dr. Wang will identify and validate cortical and subcortical functional connectivity abnormalities related to the severity of psychotic symptoms. In Aim 3, Dr. Wang will investigate the temporal variations of connectivity in individual patients and reveal abnormalities in dynamic functional connectivity related to symptoms. A series of preliminary studies conducted by Dr. Wang have laid the solid foundation for each specific aim. This research will form the basis of a study for identifying the “connectivity hubs” in individual patients for potential modulation, to be proposed in an R01 grant application before the end of the K award. Narrative (no more than 250 characters): The goal of the proposed project is to develop reliable functional estimates at the single- subject level to reveal abnormalities in both static and dynamic functional connectivity relevant to psychosis. !",Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis,9384844,K01MH111802,"['Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Portraits', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychology', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Solid', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cortex mapping', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'grasp', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'mid-career faculty', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'professor', 'psychotic symptoms', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2017,186151,551214295,-0.006835912283312468
"Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD Project Summary Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. To date, researchers have attempted to use standard machine learning methodology to identify more meaningful subtypes of COPD, but these methods often make general assumptions about the data, limiting their ability to penetrate more complex patterns in some data sets. Thus, a meaningful reclassification of COPD subtypes that could lead to more targeted therapies and interventions has been elusive. The applicant introduces a new way of looking at the COPD subtyping problem by recasting it in terms of discovering associations of individuals to disease trajectories – i.e., grouping individuals based on their similarity in response to environmental and/or disease causing variables. The machine learning methods proposed build on the most recent advances in Bayesian nonparametrics, a collection of theoretical ideas and techniques that permit very flexible data representations. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that these machine learning methods and extensions thereof – together with data sources not previously leveraged for COPD subtyping – will produce more biologically meaningful sub-groupings of patients, leading to a better understanding of the genetic and biological underpinnings of the disease and ultimately improved patient management. Aim 1 of this application involves evaluating the utility of CT-assessed lung mass – a potentially more discriminative measure of emphysema than conventionally used measures – for defining COPD subtypes using both K-means clustering and our disease trajectory algorithm. The goal of Aim 2 is to evaluate the utility of comorbidity data for defining COPD subtypes using our trajectory clustering algorithm. Novel computed tomography based measures of muscle wasting (cachexia) and pulmonary vascular pruning will be explored to determine their efficacy in subtype determination. Additionally, we will extend and test the trajectory algorithm in order to model discrete outputs (such as physician-diagnosed comorbidities), count data (e.g. exacerbations), and time-to-event data (death). In Aim 3, the applicant will extend our trajectory clustering algorithms to directly incorporate genetic and omics data for subtype discovery. Together, the research proposed in the aims of this award will take full advantage of the comprehensive data set available through the COPDGene study. Execution of the aims in this proposal will be possible through active collaboration with Dr. Ron Kikinis, M.D., a renowned leader in the field of medical image analysis, and Dr. Ed Silverman, an internationally recognized expert in the genetic epidemiology of COPD. Project Narrative Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. In carrying out the research outlined in the following proposal, we plan to develop and apply machine learning methods to better identify subpopulations of individuals who have similar forms of COPD, potentially enabling better, targeted therapies.",Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD,9316700,K25HL130637,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cachexia', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Functional Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Mass', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Scheme', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career development', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical imaging', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'flexibility', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'particle', 'peripheral blood', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K25,2017,187400,327644200,7.549983806625672e-05
"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015). He has published in several gastroenterology journals, presented research internationally, and has built the independent collaborations featured in this proposal. Central to this career development award, the candidate will leverage the expertise of several mentors and collaborators to develop deep foundational skillsets in analytic imaging, translational proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods. The University of Michigan houses a nationally recognized Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, internationally recognized proteomics expertise, and a dedicated Analytic Morphomics Group focused on computational image analysis of organs. The mentored research training will be supplemented with focused graduate-level coursework in bioinformatics, medical image analysis, machine learning methodologies, and decision support systems provided through the University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the School of Public Health. The Division of Gastroenterology and Department of Medicine have a history of strong support for Dr. Stidham and will provide the time, resources, and mentorship necessary to achieve his professional and research goals. The training provided through this career development award will be pivotal for the candidate's development as an independent translational investigator focused on individualizing therapeutic management. This research will provide the foundation for future collaborative studies to further develop these and other prognostic tools for the inflammatory bowel diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work evaluates the capabilities of quantitative image analysis and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict the probability of medical response in Crohn's disease. Improved prediction of therapeutic response would tailor Crohn's disease management such that patients unlikely to benefit from medical therapy can proceed to timely surgical management and be spared the risks and costs of modern immunosuppressive treatments.",Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease,9306838,K23DK101687,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Colonoscopy', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Fibrosis', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intestinal Fibrosis', 'Intestines', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Serum', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Steroids', 'Surgical Management', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'blood-based biomarker', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital imaging', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'glycoproteomics', 'improved', 'large bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'learning strategy', 'lecturer', 'matriculation', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool development', 'translational impact', 'translational scientist', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2017,194400,641965656,0.020297226064954644
"Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy Over 5 million children and adults in the United States have had a diagnosis of epilepsy or a seizure disorder. However, treatment options for the epilepsies remain inadequate, because many patients suffer from uncontrolled seizures and from the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to the faster development of new anti-convulsant therapies is the fact that rigorous preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). We propose to test if it is possible to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in various mouse models of acquired and genetic epilepsies. The approach rests on the recent recognition that mouse behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules at sub-second timescales that are arranged according to specific rules. These characteristic behavioral modules, and the transitions between them, can be identified without observer bias by combined 3D imaging and machine learning (ML) -assisted analytic methods. We propose to adopt this novel ML-assisted 3D video analysis technology to epilepsy research, in order to test if it can be used to identify mice with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) during inter-ictal and ictal periods in two distinct experimental TLE models, and under various experimental conditions. In addition, we will also test whether the approach is able to automatically detect not only the overtly epileptic mice in a genetic model of severe childhood epilepsy (homozygous voltage-gated sodium channel β-subunit SCN1B-/- knock-out mice), but also distinguish the seemingly normal, non-epileptic, SCN1B+/- heterozygous mice from the wild-type controls. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user-independent, inexpensive analysis of acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will test if it is possible to objectively characterize epileptic phenotypes in mice using a breakthrough technology involving machine learning-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of behavior. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to dramatically accelerate epilepsy research by enabling the objective, automated, inexpensive phenotyping of experimental animals to aid the testing of novel anticonvulsant therapies.",Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy,9369284,R21NS102908,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Image', 'Knockout Mice', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Observer Variation', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Pilocarpine', 'Probability', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Sodium Channel', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cost', 'evidence base', 'high throughput analysis', 'innovation', 'kainate', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'voltage']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,197528,560644462,-0.010399236047445951
"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carolyn Hendrickson, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Hendrickson is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented research of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a focus on the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This K23 award will provide Dr. Hendrickson with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert clinical and translational researcher in ARDS after traumatic injury; (2) to study the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after TBI involving platelet biology, endothelial activation, and lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation; (3) to implement advanced analyses of complex observational data, including machine learning; (4) to develop an independent translational research career. Dr. Hendrickson's plan to achieve these goals is supported by a multidisciplinary mentoring team of experts. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Matthay, has extensive experience in translational ARDS research and in the career development of early stage investigators. Dr. Hendrickson will work with four co-mentors: Dr. Mitchell Cohen, a translational researcher studying coagulation after trauma, Dr. Alan Hubbard, a biostatistician specializing in causal inference, Dr. Geoffrey Manley, a neurosurgeon and leading investigator in TBI research, and Dr. Mark Looney, an expert platelet biology and lung injury. The development of ARDS after TBI is common and is associated with worse neurological outcomes. The biologic mechanisms driving ARDS after TBI are poorly understood. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the risk of ARDS after TBI is mediated through activated vascular endothelium and platelets as well as non-protective mechanical ventilation strategies that use large tidal volumes. Dr. Hendrickson will investigate these causal pathways utilizing previously collected data and plasma from an ongoing observational cohort study. In this same cohort she will prospectively collect biospecimens, detailed mechanical ventilation data, and lung ultrasound images. This proposal represents an innovative approach to studying ARDS after TBI using carefully adjudicated exposures and outcomes. Dr. Hendrickson will test whether plasma biomarkers of endothelial activation, vascular permeability, and inflammation (Aim 1) and platelet function, activation, and aggregation (Aim 2) are associated with ARDS after TBI. She will collect lung ultrasound images and frequent mechanical ventilation data including tidal volumes and plateau pressures. She will test whether early exposure to non-protective mechanical ventilation is associated with ARDS after TBI (Aim 3). Addressing this gap in knowledge may lead to interventions that prevent ARDS and improve outcomes in this patient population. The research and training outlined in this proposal will form the basis for an R01-level proposal designed to study interventions to prevent and treat ARDS after traumatic injury. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because each year in the United States 1.7 million people sustain a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and over 20% of patients with severe isolated TBI develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a form of serious lung disease associated with poor neurological outcomes after TBI. Identification of biologic factors and mechanical ventilation parameters that contribute to ARDS pathogenesis after TBI is the first step in a continuum of research that will pave the way to prevention, personalized risk assessment, improved early management, and targeted treatments for ARDS in patients with TBI. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms of disease in this vulnerable population will expand the understanding of lung injury pathogenesis after a variety of traumatic injuries and perhaps in other high-risk populations.","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation",9324356,K23HL133495,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Angiopoietin-2', 'Animals', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Flow Cytometry', 'Blood Platelets', 'Body Weight', 'California', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Endothelium', 'Enrollment', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-8', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mediating', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Platelet Activation', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Supportive care', 'TBI Patients', 'TIMP3 gene', 'Testing', 'Thrombelastography', 'Thromboxane B2', 'Tidal Volume', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic injury', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'Vascular Permeabilities', 'Ventilator-induced lung injury', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung injury', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient population', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'stem', 'training opportunity', 'translational scientist']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2017,198838,685608202,0.017364126567690874
"Aptamer-Based Arrays for Detection of Pathogenic IgA1 O-Glycoforms in IgA Nephropathy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The glycosylation patterns on IgA1 antibodies are highly complex and heterogeneous. When there are dysregulations in activities of glycosylation enzymes, the hinge domain of IgA1's, i.e., the peptide domain connecting constant and variable regions, can undergo shifts in glycosylation patterns and become galactose- deficient (Gd). The galactose deficiency, together with other triggers, can lead to an auto-immune response in which patients' own antibodies form complexes with Gd-IgA1's; these complexes precipitate and cause damage in glomeruli, eventually leading to IgA1 nephropathy (IgAN).  It is of a great interest to monitor regularly Gd-IgA1's of patients who are predisposed to develop nephropathy. Further, increased understanding of correlations between dynamic variations in glycosylation patterns and the natural development of the disease in individual patients is expected to lead to improved interventions, including individually optimized therapies that could block the formation of offending complexes. None of the current approaches to assess microheterogeneity in glycosylation patterns is completely satisfactory; while elegant, these are also arduous and indirect, limited to highly specialized laboratories and difficult to reproduce in actual patients' samples, in large part due to lack of precise, well-characterized, molecular-level analytical tools  We propose to address this issue by systematic isolation of oligonucleotide-based molecular receptors or aptamers that will interact with clusters of different O-glycosides displayed in the hinge subregions. Aptameric receptors will be isolated from large oligonucleotide pools through the process of an in vitro selection and amplification coupled to the affinity separation via interactions with IgA1 hinge regions isolated from both Gd- IgAN patients and healthy controls. Individual aptamers will interact with substructures within the hinge domain, that is, with shorter peptides displaying one or more oligosaccharides. A large number of identified aptamers will be screened for their ability to interact with fractions of polyclonal IgA1's, and a variety of those aptamers that show a quantitatively different response to IgA1s from patients and matched controls will be selected for a more detailed characterization and incorporation in ""classification sensor arrays"" (CSAs).  As the result of our work, we will have immediately a set of aptamers that would together form a classification sensor array, an artificial ""nose"" capable of distinguishing samples belonging to patients with Gd- IgAN from healthy controls, as well as quantifying the extent of shifts in glycosylation patterns. Further molecular-level characterizatio of epitopes (subdomains) that these aptamers recognize is expected to enable studies towards identification of structures that are responsible for auto-immune responses in individual patients, and correlation with secondary triggers of diseases, which are the key step in the rational design of targeted inhibitors of the complex formation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Complex saccharide structures ('glycans') play crucial roles in a wide range of biological functions and diseases such as autoimmunity, cancer, and nephropathy. We will help elucidate the role of complex glycans in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy, one of the most common causes of kidney failure worldwide, by systematically and exhaustively generating oligonucleotide-based receptors (aptamers) for glycan clusters on IgA1 antibodies. This will allow new diagnostic protocols based on pattern recognition with classification arrays and, in the long-term, personalized therapies to prevent antigen-autoantibody interaction and nephropathy.",Aptamer-Based Arrays for Detection of Pathogenic IgA1 O-Glycoforms in IgA Nephropathy,9308943,R21DK109690,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Alkaloids', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmunity', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Enzymes', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Galactose', 'Genetic', 'Glycosides', 'IGA Glomerulonephritis', 'IgA1', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin Constant Region', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunology', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lectin', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nephrology', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nose', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Sphingosine', 'Standardization', 'Steroids', 'Structure', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'aptamer', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder control', 'exhaustion', 'glycosylation', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'inorganic phosphate', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'screening', 'sensor', 'sugar', 'tool']",NIDDK,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2017,200347,558628098,-0.0078016293172617655
"SWIFT-ActiveScreener: research and development of an intelligent web-based document screening system Project Summary More than 4,000 systematic reviews are performed each year in the fields of environmental health and evidence- based medicine, with each review requiring, on average, between six months to one year of effort to complete. In order to remain accurate, systematic reviews require regular updates after their initial publication, with most reviews out of date within five years. In the screening phase of systematic review, researchers use detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria to decide whether each article in a set of candidate citations is relevant to the research question under consideration. For each article considered, a researcher reads the title and abstract and evaluates its content with respect to the prespecified criteria. A typical review may require screening thousands or tens of thousands of articles in this manner. Under the assumption that it takes a skilled reviewer 30-90 seconds, on average, to screen a single abstract, dual-screening a set of 10,000 abstracts may require between 150 to 500 hours of labor. We have shown in previous work that automated machine learning methods for article prioritization can reduce by more than 50% the human effort required to screen articles for inclusion in a systematic review. Recently, we have further extended these methods and packaged them into a web-based, collaborative systematic review software application called SWIFT-Active Screener. Active Screener has been used successfully to reduce the effort required to screen articles for systematic reviews conducted at a variety of organizations including the National Institute of Environmental Health Science (NIEHS), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), The Endocrine Disruption Exchange (TEDX), and the Evidence Based Toxicology Collaboration (EBTC). These early adopters have provided us with an abundance of useful data and user feedback, and we have identified several areas where we can continue to improve our methods and software. Our goal for the current proposal is to conduct additional research and development to make significant improvements to SWIFT-Active Screener, including several innovations that will be necessary for commercial success. The research we propose encompasses three specific aims: (1) Investigate several improvements to statistical algorithms used for article prioritization and recall estimation. We will explore promising avenues for further improving the performance of our existing algorithms and address critical technical issues that limit the applicability of our current methods (Aim 1 – Improved Statistical Models). (2) Explore ways in which we can improve our models and methods to handle the scenario in which an existing systematic review is updated with new data several years after its initial publication (Aim 2 – New Methods for Systematic Review Updates). (3) Investigate several questions related to scaling the system to support hundreds to thousands of simultaneous screeners (Aim 3 - Software Engineering for Scalability, Usability and Full Text Extraction). Project Narrative Systematic review is a formal process used widely in evidence-based medicine and environmental health research to identify, assess, and integrate the primary scientific literature with the goal of answering a specific, targeted question in pursuit of the current scientific consensus. By conducting research and development to build a web-based, collaborative systematic review software application that uses machine learning to prioritize documents for screening, we will make an important contribution toward ongoing efforts to automate systematic review. These efforts will serve to make systematic reviews both more efficient to produce and less expensive to maintain, a result which will greatly accelerate the process by which scientific consensus is obtained in a variety of medical and health-related disciplines having great public significance.",SWIFT-ActiveScreener: research and development of an intelligent web-based document screening system,9467160,R43ES029001,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Discipline', 'Endocrine disruption', 'Environmental Health', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Online Systems', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Software Engineering', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Text', 'Toxicology', 'United States Department of Agriculture', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Update', 'Work', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'research and development', 'screening', 'success', 'systematic review', 'usability']",NIEHS,"SCIOME, LLC",R43,2017,211900,2510992,-0.018359576183332026
"Deep learning for representation of codes used for SEER-Medicare claims research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose developing an algorithm and user-friendly software to better identify treatments using Medicare claims data. We will validate our approach using procedures listed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database as a gold standard. In this way, we hope to better match procedures identified using Medicare claims data with SEER listed procedures.  The focus of this research is observational (i.e. non-randomized) data. Well-run randomized clinical trials can provide the best level of evidence of treatment effects. However, randomized trials in the United States have suffered from poor accrual for many interventions. Despite the fact that well-designed randomized clinical trials should be the gold standard, well-designed observational studies might be the only method of obtaining inferences concerning comparative effectiveness for some cancer interventions.  In cancer research, one of the most commonly used databases for observational research is the linked SEER-Medicare database. SEER-Medicare data has provided useful measurements of the effectiveness of a number of cancer therapies. Algorithms for identifying relevant treatment and diagnosis codes using Medicare data are often based on clinical reasoning and scientific evidence. One group of researchers, for example, developed an algorithm for identifying laparoscopic surgery among kidney cancer cases before claims codes for laparoscopic surgery were well developed. While such algorithms are useful for others pursuing similar investigations, there may still be substantial mismatch between treatment identified by the SEER cancer registry and treatment identified through Medicare claims. In this work, we propose developing a rigorous machine learning algorithm that can help researchers in better identifying treatments in Medicare claims data. Specifically, we will design a neural language modeling algorithm and implement a software system that finds vector representations of diagnosis and procedure codes.  We plan on using the neural language modeling algorithm to learn vector representations from SEER- Medicare claims data where related procedure and diagnosis codes are ""neighbors"" (i.e. closely related). We will investigate whether the codes we identify within neighborhoods correspond to the procedure codes used for published SEER-Medicare studies. We will then design a software assistant interface that will allow an investigator to explore which codes are related to a given seed of diagnosis or procedure codes. Finally, we will investigate the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm by comparing procedures identified using Medicare claims with procedures listed in the SEER database. We will replicate analyses from a published SEER-Medicare paper to investigate if estimated treatment effects differ when using our novel algorithm compared to using the algorithm in the published paper. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In cancer research, one of the most commonly used databases for observational research is the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. To improve the identification of procedures when using Medicare claims data, we will design a software assistant interface that will allow an investigator to explore which codes are related to a given seed of diagnosis or procedure codes. This should improve the identification of procedures when using Medicare claims data, and make conclusions drawn from analyses using the database more reliable and consistent.",Deep learning for representation of codes used for SEER-Medicare claims research,9188540,R21CA202130,"['Algorithms', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Ethical Issues', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gold', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Language', 'Laparoscopic Surgical Procedures', 'Learning', 'Level of Evidence', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'SEER Program', 'Seeds', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Study', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Update', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplasm registry', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'relating to nervous system', 'software systems', 'treatment effect', 'usability', 'user friendly software', 'vector', 'volunteer']",NCI,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R21,2017,219753,29585825,-0.028170421591914276
"New Approach to US Elasticity Imaging Project Summary To more fully exploit the basic science of mechanobiology as it pertains to breast cancer progression, the medical imaging field continues to search for fast, safe, and effective elasticity imaging methods. In this project we propose a fundamentally new approach to ultrasonic elasticity imaging in which the weak forces applied to patient tissues and the measured displacements that result are used to train a numerical model specifically for that patient. This constitutive model is developed using finite-element methods and neural networks assembled in a unique configuration called the AutoProgressive (AutoP) Method. AutoP “learns” complete stress and strain properties directly from sparse force and displacement measurements and without a mathematical model. Using quasi-static stimuli, AutoP exploits the fact that each force-displacement estimate contains information about mechanical properties at all locations in the contiguous tissue. From measurement information and conservation laws, AutoP generates an informational model without the need to make assumptions about tissue linearity, isotropy, or other material properties normally required when constructing images that display tissue mechanical properties. Once an accurate material-property model is formed by AutoP, we adopt a separate rheological model (e.g., Kelvin Voigt) to form viscoelastic parameters for image display. The AutoP method employs beamformed RF-echo acquisitions from which point displacements are estimated, applied compressional force sensed at the transducer surface, and tissue shape.  No other imaging method is capable of estimating all relevant stress fields, which gives AutoP unique capabilities. AutoP estimates the mechanical properties that one strives to obtain from an inverse problem approach, but AutoP is not a mathematical inverse technique and hence does not suffer from nonunique solutions. Without the need to assume material properties, AutoP can (in principle) model tissue properties in three dimensions and in time following large deformations in highly-nonlinear, anisotropic media. This R21 proposal focuses on establishing the feasibility of the AutoP methodology for subsequent clinical trials under future funding. At the completion of this two-year project, we will demonstrate a new tool for medical imaging capable of exploring the mechanical properties of tissues over a very broad range of deformations. We specifically target ultrasonic methods and quasi-static force stimuli in this project. However AutoP could eventually be coupled to other imaging modalities (e.g., MRE, OCE) or dynamic force-stimulus methods.  The scientific premise underlying AutoP is that we already record all of the information needed to generate a very broad range of elasticity images. The key to unlocking this information is to set aside mathematical models in favor of data-driven informational models built using the unique machine learning abilities of the AutoP method. If successful, AutoP will have a major influence on medical elasticity imaging methods. Project Narrative: A new type of machine-learning method is proposed for elasticity imaging of patient tissues that offers the potential to minimize many current limitations. If we are successful in this development, ultrasonic elasticity imaging would significantly improve in its ability to accurately represent mechanical properties of breast tissues, without any changes in current instrumentation and without increasing cost to the healthcare system or adding risk to patients.",New Approach to US Elasticity Imaging,9385425,R21EB023402,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Breast', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elasticity', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Isotropy', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modulus', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Ultrasonics', 'Writing', 'aged', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'cost', 'experience', 'healthy volunteer', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'imaging properties', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical model', 'mechanical properties', 'model building', 'model development', 'novel strategies', 'object shape', 'processing speed', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'viscoelasticity']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2017,220062,76545728,-0.029178888517695855
"Software for OCT Analysis of Vascular Stents Software for OCT Analysis of Vascular Stents PI: Ronny Shalev, PhD, Dyad Medical Summary Dyad Medical, Inc. will create intravascular OCT (IVOCT) software for clinical, live time determination of stent apposition (OCTivat-live, the live time OCT image visualization and analysis tool) and for offline analysis of stent implantation (OCTivat-stent). Every year, 100s of thousands of patients in the US are treated with intra- vascular stents creating an opportunity for both solutions. Although advancements such as drug eluting metal stents hinder restenosis, there remains significant room for improvement. Stent design parameters include drug, material (bioresorbable vs metal), polymer composition, coatings to stimulate cell coverage, etc. To opti- mize designs, sensitive, in vivo assessments are needed for preclinical and clinical evaluations. Intravascular OCT (IVOCT) is the lone imaging modality with the resolution and contrast to meet this challenge. The Core Lab at CWRU is the premiere site in the world for manual analysis of IVOCT image data. A cardiologist analyst takes 6-16 hrs to analyze manually a single stent, and despite training and quality assurance measures, inter- analyst variability can limit the power to determine changes between stent designs. Building upon work at CWRU, we will develop advanced, highly automated software to greatly speed analysis, improve reproducibil- ity, increase accuracy, and harmonize analysis. Software will reduce costs by decreasing manual labor, and with improved reproducibility, possibly enable the use of historical data, eliminating cost of a control arm. Re- garding live time analysis, rather than manually reviewing >500 images in a pullback, with fast software, it will be possible to present the number and location of malapposed struts in 3D, providing instant feedback to phy- sicians on the need for additional dilatation with a larger balloon or higher pressure. In addition, we will auto- matically determine stent and vessel area along the length of the pullback, allowing us to compute stent ex- pansion and eccentricity, quantitative measures related to successful stent deployment, the most important de- terminant of outcome. IVOCT could also play a role at patient follow up. If a stent is well covered, then long- term anti-platelet therapy might be unnecessary, minimizing bleeding risk. If a stent has many uncovered struts, a therapeutic might prevent stent thrombosis or stimulate healing. Project Narrative: We will develop methods for improved in vivo assessment of intravascular stents, the treatment of choice for 100s of thousands of patients, suffering from ischemic heart disease, in the US every year. Our methods will enable optimization of stent technologies and improved deployment for improved treatment of vascular dis- ease.",Software for OCT Analysis of Vascular Stents,9407267,R43HL137500,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Dilatation - action', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Feedback', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heart', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Implant', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Ions', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Needs Assessment', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Services', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Stents', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'arm', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'cost', 'design', 'follow-up', 'healing', 'image visualization', 'imaging modality', 'implantation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'personalized diagnostics', 'preclinical evaluation', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'quality assurance', 'research clinical testing', 'restenosis', 'statistics', 'stent thrombosis', 'tool', 'treatment choice']",NHLBI,"DYAD MEDICAL, INC.",R43,2017,224744,1085076,-0.004072132602295355

The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9326841,K01ES026835,"['Affect', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Drug-sensitive', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'improved', 'instructor', 'killings', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIEHS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K01,2017,225549,178569161,-0.004766401168269072
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into the causes, pathogenesis, and natural history of DILI. The ongoing Retrospective study has collected 109 DNA samples from subjects with liver injury attributed to one of 8 drugs. In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and outcomes of drug induced liver injury via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients into the ongoing DILIN Prospective and Retrospective studies. The collection of early blood and urine samples from well-characterized DILI patients will allow for innovative studies of patient, drug and environmental risk factors. Further development of a computerized diagnostic instrument and expansion of the LiverTox website is also planned which will provide doctors, researchers, and the general public an authoritative and up-to-date resource that can help accelerate DILI research in the US and abroad.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013,9325499,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anabolic steroids', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Ancillary Study', 'Assessment tool', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Budesonide', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Expert Opinion', 'Floxacillin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Herbal supplement', 'Histopathology', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Injury to Liver', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular', 'Monograph', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Valproic Acid', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'chemical property', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'elastography', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'screening', 'transcriptomics', 'web site', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2017,317128,641965656,-0.017398465194651654
"Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in the laboratory sciences have led to the discovery of a large number of candidate biomarkers, which hold great potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. At this time, an important research bottleneck is the lack of well-developed statistical methods for effectively using these candidate biomarkers to enhance clinical practice. It is our goal to develop new tools to select, combine, and evaluate biomarkers for disease classification and treatment selection. Classification markers predict an individual's disease outcome and are useful for the detection of diseases at an early stage when a treatment is most effective. Research proposed in Aim 1 seeks to select and combine markers to improve the classification performance in disease screening and diagnosis. Treatment selection markers predict a patient's response to different therapies and allow for the selection of a therapy that has the best predicted outcome. Aim 2 seeks to develop marker-based treatment selection rules to maximize the benefit to the patient population. A biomarker that is useful for guiding treatment decision to the general population will have different values to different patients due to individual differences in their response to treatment and in their tolerance of the disease harm and treatment cost. Aim 3 seeks to develop a new graphical tool to customize the evaluation of a biomarker for aiding treatment decision based on personal characteristics.  Our statistical methods will apply broadly to general medical fields. In particular, we will apply these methods to analyze several cancer studies including (1) biomarker studies for prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer from the Early Detection and Research Network; (2) the Women's Health Initiative breast cancer genome-wide association study; and (3) the Oncotype-Dx breast cancer study from the Southwest Oncology Group. Programs and algorithms developed in this proposal will be made available to public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The focus of this proposal is to develop novel statistical methods for the design and analysis of biomarker studies. In particular, the proposed methods will develop marker combinations to improve disease diagnosis, develop treatment selection rules to cost-effectively reduce population disease burden, and help patients and clinicians make informed decisions about the use of medical tests in clinical practices.",Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers,8996183,R01GM106177,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Screening for cancer', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'burden of illness', 'candidate marker', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'flexibility', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient population', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2017,323753,758431960,-0.05972077000156602
"3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical assessment of optic nerve swelling is limited by the subjective ophthalmoscopic evaluation by experts in order to diagnose and differentiate the cause of the optic disc edema. The long-term goal of our research effort is to develop automated 3D image-analysis approaches for the identification of an optimal set of 3D parameters to quantify the severity of optic nerve edema over time and to help differentiate the underlying cause. The overall objective in this application is to develop strategies, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve swelling in patients diagnosed with papilledema and to ascertain morphological features that differentiate papilledema from other disorders causing optic nerve edema. The central hypothesis is that information about volumetric and shape parameters obtainable from 3D image analysis techniques will improve the ability to accurately assess the severity and cause of optic disc edema over the existing subjective ophthalmoscopic assessment of optic nerve swelling using the Fris�n scale or current 2D OCT parameters. The rationale for the proposed research is that having such 3D parameters will dramatically improve the way optic disc swelling is assessed. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1. Develop and evaluate the methodology for computing novel volumetric and shape parameters of a swollen optic nerve head from SD-OCT. This will be completed by refining and evaluating our novel 3D graph-based segmentation algorithms in SD-OCT volumes of patients with optic disc swelling. 2. Identify SD-OCT parameters that optimally correlate with clinical measurements of severity in patients with papilledema and develop a continuous severity scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to relate SD-OCT parameters to expert-defined Fris�n scale grades (a fundus-based measure of severity). It is anticipated that volumetric 3D parameters will more closely correlate with clinical measures than 2D parameters and will provide a continuous severity scale. 3. Identify SD-OCT parameters that differentiate papilledema from other causes of optic disc swelling (or apparent optic disc swelling, as in pseudopapilledema) and develop a corresponding predictive classifier. Our working hypothesis is that 3D shape parameters, especially those near Bruch's membrane opening, will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach is innovative because the 3D image-analysis methodology developed by the applicants enables novel determination of 3D volumetric and shape parameters and represents a significant improvement over the status quo of using qualitative image information and 2D OCT image information for assessing optic disc swelling. The proposed research is significant because it will help to establish a much-needed alternative and more objective method by which to assess the severity and cause of optic disc swelling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of novel spectral-domain optical coherence tomography parameters for assessing the severity and cause of optic nerve edema is expected to enable more efficient and effective diagnosis and management strategies of patients with such swelling. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to reduce the burdens of disability and is particularly relevant to the part of NEI's mission regarding understanding blinding eye diseases and preserving sight.",3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema,9264531,R01EY023279,"['Acute', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Ophthalmoscopes', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Papilledema', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Swelling', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'digital', 'disability burden', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'optical imaging', 'public health relevance']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2017,339750,193405667,0.005702179153097633
"Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rationale. Diabetes is a leading cause of renal disease, accounting for 40% of the estimated 20 million US adult cases of chronic kidney disease. There is, however, substantial heterogeneity across diabetic patients with regards to development of kidney disease. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic biomarkers that can provide early and reliable evidence of future kidney disease, so that high-risk patients can receive optimal medical care. Existing clinical, proteomic and genomic markers do not consistently nor accurately predict kidney function decline. Metabolomics, a systematic evaluation of the end-products of cellular function in fluids, has the potential to inform physiological and pathological effects of chronic diseases. Metabolomic analysis combined with advanced quantitative methods could play a key role in building clinically useful prognostic signatures of diabetic kidney disease. Yet, development of computational methods with adequate rigor has lagged behind the technical capacity to perform large scale quantitative metabolomics. In this proposal we aim to address this computational gap in diabetic kidney disease research. Aims. We will implement rigorous computational methods to identify robust prognostic metabolite + clinical + genetic signatures of diabetic kidney disease progression. Specifically, we aim to (i) test the accuracy of previous signatures, and apply state-of-the-art analytic techniques and novel statistical methods to identify new multivariate metabolite sets for predicting kidney disease progression; (ii) quantify patterns of co-regulation of metabolites in diabetic kidney disease, and develop new tools in network biology to discover novel enzymes, proteins, metabolites, and molecular pathways which are implicated in diabetic kidney disease progression; (iii) test if these models can accurately predict kidney disease progression in independent prospective cohorts. Methods. Using clinical, genetic and metabolomic data from large prospective cohorts of > 1200 diverse, well- characterized patients with Type 2 diabetes, we will apply statistical methods for variable selection (e.g., penalized regression), and machine learning methods (e.g., random forest), which are known to perform well in the high-dimensional setting, to identify robust and parsimonious signatures of kidney disease progression. We will quantify inter-metabolite co-regulation patterns and infer biological pathways implicated in diabetic kidney disease. Throughout the modeling process, a rigorous training-validation paradigm will be adopted in order to improve reproducibility of models and reduce chance findings. Impact. A major product of this work will be the development of a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline. Our findings will also provide insight into markers of renal dysfunction, and elucidate possible therapeutic targets for treating diabetic kidney disease, thus potentially informing the design of future clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney disease, a major and common complication of diabetes, can lead to repeated hospitalizations and premature death. There is an urgent need to develop clinical tools that can provide early evidence that a given diabetic patient is likely to progress to kidney disease in the future. In this proposal, we will identify new urinary biomarkers and use novel statistical modeling methods to create a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline, with the ultimate goal of improving disease management and reducing mortality rates for these patients.",Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease,9306637,R01DK110541,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pima Indian', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'biological heterogeneity', 'chemical association', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'forest', 'genetic signature', 'genomic biomarker', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'model development', 'mortality', 'nephrogenesis', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2017,340545,524978793,0.011233691514759796
"High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs ABSTRACT In this application we will perform high throughput, high content, screening for small molecules that improve kidney regeneration after acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI presents a dire unmet medical need because of its high prevalence with long-term adverse health effects and life-threatening sequelae. Mortality is high and the only effective treatments are renal replacement therapies. The onset of the precipitating event is unpredictable, and in many instances once patients are admitted to the hospital, injury has already occurred. Improving recovery from injury therefore presents an attractive opportunity for intervention, but to date, no therapies are available that are effective if administered post injury. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate and follows a well-defined cellular mechanism that encompasses dedifferentiation of surviving renal tubule cells, proliferation of resulting progenitors, and repopulation of the denuded tubule. This sequence of events, together with their respective molecular markers, is conserved between humans, mouse, and zebrafish. During regeneration, transcription factors normally expressed during organogenesis (e.g.,lhx1a, pax2, and pax8) are reactivated. We previously demonstrated that small molecule-mediated augmentation of endogenous Lhx1a expression can ameliorate recovery in zebrafish and mouse models of AKI. Together these data support the overall hypothesis that augmentation by small molecules of cellular programs that drive kidney repair after injury represents a novel pharmacologic approach for the treatment of AKI and associated sequelae. Using a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses Lhx1a-EGFP we have developed an artificial intelligence-based, high-content assay to quantify lhx1a expression in the living embryo. Using multivariate analysis, the assay met accepted HTS assay performance standards and was validated in three-day variability studies and a small pilot library screen. We will perform a primary HTS of 50,000 compounds from the MLPCN collection. Prioritized hits will be subjected to a fully implemented, rigorous secondary assay paradigm encompassing kidney organ development, metabolic stability, in vivo efficacy, and activity profiling in a pathophysiological relevant AKI model. At the end of these studies we will have identified functionally and mechanistically characterized in vivo chemical probes to investigate the biology of kidney injury and regeneration, some of which are expected to have features that make them suitable for development into preclinical leads. NARRATIVE Acute kidney injury (AKI) presents a dire unmet medical need with unacceptably high mortality rates and a lack of therapeutic modalities. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate that can be enhanced by small molecules. In this proposal we will perform high-content, high throughput screening for kidney regeneration in zebrafish to discover novel chemical probes to investigate mechanisms of augmented kidney regeneration after injury.",High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs,9262478,R01DK112652,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Breeding', 'Carboxylic Acids', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Fibrosis', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Liver', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Microsomes', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Bank', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Organogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Prodrugs', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Renal tubule structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tubular formation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Zebrafish', 'analog', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'kidney repair', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'organ growth', 'organ regeneration', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,348188,570146095,-0.013147130928079842
"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning. Success of the project will overcome the major technical hurdles in the use of MRI in radiation therapy and will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information.

"A Novel Informatics System for Craniosynostosis Surgery Project Summary CranioSynOstosis (CSO) is the premature fusion of one or more of cranial sutures that connect individual skull bones for kids. The estimated prevalence of CSO is one in 2500 live births and even higher. Our ultimate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS). CSO is an extremely serious birth defect that involves the premature fusion, of one or more sutures on a baby's skull. CSO, in terms of the fused suture, could be classified mainly into several types of synostosis, such as sagittal, coronal, metopic, and lambdoid. Infants with CSO may have problems with brain and skull growth, resulting in cognitive impairment. This defect may not only ruin the infant's life, but also deeply affect the infant's family. SAS, recognized as a safe, effective, and less invasive treatment method, introduced to treat the CSO. This treatment uses the force of a spring to reshape the skull in a slower manner that harnesses the growth of the skull to assist with shape change. Patient-specific spring selection is the principal barrier to the advancement of SAS for CSO because few surgeons have the experience to select personalized springs for each patient. The selection of the spring force is a crucial step in this surgical treatment, and it is dependent on the experience of the surgeon. Important factors essential in the selection of the spring force include the ages, bone thickness and the subtypes of CSO. One example is that sagittal CSO with an elongated occiput needs a stronger posterior spring, while one with no predominant characteristics typically needs a mid-range anterior and posterior spring. The current problem is that we do not have a complete objective way of classification of CSO and sagittal CSO and estimation of the spring force for the individual. Our hypothesis is that CSO and sagittal CSO can be accurately classified based on the features from sutures and head shape, and behaviors of calvarial bone tissue following virtual optimal spring force can be accurately simulated by integrating a finite element method (FEM) with statistical learning model. To test our hypothesis, we are proposing the following Specific Aim: (1) To define the eSuture Informatic system and build the database, with CT and DTI data; (2) To develop tools for image processing, segmentation, registration, quantification of sutures, and automatically categorize each patient to one catalogue of the CSO types or sagittal CSO subtype; (3) To model and estimate the optimal spring force for SAS; and (4) To validate and evaluate the eSuture system. Our system will produce a paradigm shift in CSO diagnosis and treatment. Narrative Our immediate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis (CSO) using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS).

"Development and Dissemination of MuscleMiner: An Imaging Informatics Tool for Mus DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Image evaluation of skeletal muscle biopsies is a procedure essential to research and clinical practice. Although widely used, several major limitations exist with respect to current muscle image morphometric measurement, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, retrieval, and mining procedures: 1) Although traditional morphometric parameters, such as cross-sectional area (CSA) and minimum Feret diameter, etc., serve as critical indicators for assessing muscle function, current measurements are still largely based on manual or semi-automated methods, leading to significant labor costs with large potential inter-observer variability. 2) The current archiving of muscle images is still mainy based on outdated tools such as Excel spreadsheets and computer file folders. Given a new muscle image, it is almost impossible to quickly cross-compare, visualize, query, search, and retrieve previous cases exhibiting similar image contents with comparable morphometric measures, for the purpose of either discovering novel biological co-correlations at benchside, or providing personalized diagnosis and prognosis at bedside. 3) Although a typical muscle image often contains millions of data points (pixels), in clinical practice, doctors often condense this rich information into one or two diagnostic labels and discard the rest. Novel image markers, which are not always apparent through visual inspections or not manually quantifiable, but potentially represent critical diagnostic and prognostic values for precision medicine, have not been rigorously examined. Similarly, in basic science research, only a very limited number of known measures (e.g., CSA) are considered. Some non-traditional measures, such as myofiber shapes that hold the potential to serve as new indicators of muscle functions, are not fully investigated. 4) Current muscle image analysis and searching functions are fairly low throughput. As a frontier research area, Cloud computing can handle big image data in a distributed manner by providing high-throughput computational power. However, its application to muscle images has never been explored. MuscleMiner will provide a complete suite of tools for automated image morphometric measurements, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, content-based image retrieval, bioinformatics image mining, and Cloud computing. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) Develop the automated morphometric measurement unit, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) unit, and the image archiving and visualization unit. 2) Develop the advanced bioinformatics image mining unit to assist in the rapid discovery and validation of new image markers. 3) Develop the Cloud computing unit to enable big image data processing and searching functions. Disseminate this freely available, Cloud-enabled imaging informatics system to muscle research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose to develop and disseminate an advanced Cloud-enabled imaging informatics tool - MuscleMiner. MuscleMiner will provide a complete suite of tools for automated image morphometric measurements, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, content-based image retrieval, and bioinformatics image mining. The goal of MuscleMiner is to offer a freely available and powerful tool to help all clinician and basic scienc muscle researchers in their daily work. Beyond fast, objective, reproducible, and automated morphometric measurements, the impact of MuscleMiner will be multiplied by laboratories using the CBIR and visualization units (Aim 1), bioinformatics image mining unit (Aim 2), and Cloud-computing unit (Aim 3) to deeply mine and fully utilize the rich information embedded in large collections of muscle images.",Development and Dissemination of MuscleMiner: An Imaging Informatics Tool for Mus,9316507,R01AR065479,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Cells', 'Client', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Exhibits', 'Fascicle', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Fibers', 'Muscle function', 'Myopathy', 'Pathologic', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Shapes', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Slide', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'System', 'Technology', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical practice', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'frontier', 'image archival system', 'image visualization', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'personalized diagnostics', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic value', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'wasting']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2017,379732,188894159,-0.006706519050154674
"Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The uveitides are a collection of ~30 distinct diseases characterized by intraocular infection. Each disease has its own features, course, treatment, and prognosis. Traditionally, the uveitides have been grouped by the primary anatomic site of inflammation as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. However, there are substantial limitations to this ""lumping"" of diseases. For example, among the posterior uveitides, some (e.g. toxoplasmic retinitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis) are infectious and require treatment with antimicrobial/antiviral agents, some are chronic, presumed immune-mediated diseases that require immunosuppression (e.g. birdshot chorioretinitis, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis), and a few are self-limited, spontaneously-remitting diseases with a good prognosis (e.g. acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome). As such precise diagnosis is critical for research, including epidemiology, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease specific clinical trials. Classification criteria are a type of ""diagnostic"" criteria used for reserch purposes. Although classification criteria seek to optimize sensitivity and specificity, when a trade-off is required, they emphasize specificity in order to ensure that a homogeneous group of patients is being studied. A precise phenotype is required particularly for genomic risk factor studies of complex disorders and translational pathogenesis research, as inclusion of other diseases with different risk factors and disease mechanisms would confound the results. Currently there are no widely-accepted and validated classification criteria for any of the uveitides. Preliminary data indicate ""fair to moderate"" agreement at best on the independent diagnosis of any one case by uveitis experts (κ's 0.27-0.40), but the ability of committees to reach agreement on the diagnosis of >98% of cases. The goal of the ""Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides"" project is for the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group to develop classification criteria for the 25 leading uveitides using a formal, rigorous approach. There are 4 phases to the project: 1) informatics, to develop a standardized terminology; 2) case collection, to develop a preliminary database of ~250 cases of each disease; 3) case selection, to select at least 150-200 cases of each disease that are generally accepted to be the disease (using formal consensus techniques) from the preliminary database into a final database; and 4) data analysis, using machine learning approaches, of the final database to develop a parsimonious set of criteria for each disease that minimizes misclassification. The informatics and case collection phases of the Project are complete. The case selection phase is well underway and uses online voting and consensus conference calls to achieve supermajority acceptance on all cases included in the final database. The goals of this application are to complete case selection and data analysis and develop classification criteria for the 25 of the major uveitides. These results are crucial to future clinical research i the field of uveitis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Collectively, the uveitides are the 5th leading cause of blindness in the U.S., and the cost of treating them is estimated to be similar to that of treating diabetic retinopathy. Because uveitis occurs in all age groups, including children and working-age adults, there is a greater potential for years of vision lost than with age- related diseases. Clinical research in the field of uveitis has been hampered by diagnostic imprecision and a lack of widely-accepted and validated classification criteria, the development of which is the goal of this application; these criteria are needed urgently to advance epidemiology, genomic research, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease-specific clinical trials.",Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides,9250167,R01EY026593,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior uveitis', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Choroiditis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intermediate Uveitis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nomenclature', 'Outcomes Research', 'Panuveitis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pigments', 'Posterior Uveitis', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Retinitis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'United States', 'Uveitis', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Voting', 'age group', 'age related', 'aging population', 'antimicrobial', 'birdshot chorioretinitis', 'cost', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web page', 'working group']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2017,400107,415711940,0.0014226070147043855
"Daily Immune Monitoring in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating condition characterized by profound, chronic fatigue that is not alleviated by rest, as well as pain, post-exertional malaise, and impairments in memory and concentration. ME/CFS affects over one million women in the United States, causing significant distress and loss of function in affected individuals and a significant financial burden on society Because the underlying pathophysiology of ME/CFS is not well-understood, there are no effective treatments developed specifically for the condition, and many patients are unsatisfied with existing treatment options. Previous research provides a strong case for inflammatory involvement in ME/CFS, though no immune factors have been consistently predictive of fatigue across studies. Conventional cross-sectional research approaches may not be sufficiently sensitive for identifying ME/CFS biomarkers in cases of low-level or atypical inflammation. We have observed that women with ME/CFS demonstrate considerable day-to-day variability in their fatigue severity, and this variability may reflect rapid shifts in underlying disease mechanisms. By viewing the daily fatigue variability as an important signal, and collecting blood samples daily, we have identified a small set of serum cytokines that are strongly correlated with changes in ME/CFS 1fatigue. In this proposed study, we plan to confirm our preliminary findings of immune-fatigue relationships in a larger sample. We will collect blood samples for 25 consecutive days in 70 women with ME/CFS, as well as 20 healthy controls and 20 active fatigue controls (individuals with hypothyroidism). Blood samples will be analyzed for 51 different immune factors associated with inflammation. In addition, participants will submit daily reports of fatigue severity on handheld computers. By analyzing fatigue scores and cytokine concentrations longitudinally, we can identify cytokines that ""track"" day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. This approach will allow us to develop a physiological profile that distinguishes high fatigue days from low fatigue days, providing important information about ME/CFS mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will develop a physiological model that uses serum cytokine levels to accurately predict day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. In Aim 2, we will define important ME/CFS subgroups based on cytokine-fatigue relationships. In Aim 3, we will develop a temporal pathway between immune factors and fatigue that identifies early drivers of fatigue. Additionally, we will develop a specimen bank of blood samples that can be made available to other interested researchers. Intensive longitudinal immune monitoring is a unique approach to understanding ME/CFS pathophysiology. Biomarkers revealed by this research will serve as tools in the development of ME/CFS diagnostic tests, and will provide excellent targets for developing improved therapies.

"Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images Abstract Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness among US adults between the ages of 20 and 74 years. Laser photocoagulation surgery has been established as an effective way of treating retinopathy if it is detected early. Yearly retinal screening examinations are a potent tool in the battle to reduce the incidence of blindness from diabetic retinopathy because they provide diabetic patients with timely diagnoses and consequently, the potential for timely treatment. Primary care safety net clinics provide monitoring and other services for diabetic patients but they are often not equipped to provide specialty care services such as retinal screenings. Access to specialists who can provide retinal screenings can be increased through the use of telemedicine, which has shown great promise as a means of screening for diabetic retinopathy in the US and internationally. A pilot study by Charles Drew University investigators had a total of 2,876 teleretinal screenings performed for diabetic retinopathy, with 2,732 unique diabetic patients from six South Los Angeles safety net clinics screened. The present study aims to build on this prior work by: (a) developing novel software that utilizes information from clinical records to detect latent diabetic retinopathy in diabetic patients who have not yet received an annual eye examination, and (b) devising methods to speed up the diabetic retinopathy detection process for diabetic patients who have had digital retinal images taken by partially automating the process using image processing and machine learning techniques. Specifically, we propose to: 1. Develop predictive models for diabetic retinopathy using risk factors collected from patient clinical records. 2. Develop predictive models for automated diabetic retinopathy assessment using a combination of patient  risk factor data and data from digital retinal images previously evaluated by experts. 3. Evaluate the predictive accuracy of: a) the models developed for specific aim 2, and, b) the assessments of  optometrist readers against standard of care dilated retinal examinations by board certified  ophthalmologists for 300 diabetic patients utilizing a new Los Angeles County reading center. 4. Create web-based software tools based on the predictive models developed in specific aim 1 that can be  used to initiate outreach to high-risk patients in under-resourced settings, boosting detection rates for those  patients who are most at risk for diabetic retinopathy. 5. Establish targeted outreach methods to promote screening for patients that the predictive models from  specific aim 1 identify as potentially having undetected diabetic retinopathy. Narrative Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness among US adults between the ages of 20 and 74 years. Although previous studies within the US and internationally have shown that teleretinal screening can increase access to eye examinations for detecting retinopathy, few studies have focused on the US urban safety net, which has ophthalmic screening rates that are well below the US average and a preponderance of diabetic patients who are from ethnic minority groups. Building on a previous teleretinal screening study that assessed 2,732 South Los Angeles patients for retinopathy, this study deploys machine learning and image processing techniques to detect latent retinopathy in unscreened diabetic patients and partially automate the diabetic retinopathy detection process for teleretinal screening.",Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images,9353867,R01LM012309,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alaska Native', 'American Indians', 'Asian Americans', 'Blindness', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'County', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Eye', 'Glucose', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Insurance', 'Hispanics', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'International', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Optometrist', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Services', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Telemedicine', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'disorder prevention', 'ethnic minority population', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'inner city', 'laser photocoagulation', 'medical specialties', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outreach', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'racial minority', 'randomized trial', 'safety net', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend']",NLM,CHARLES R.

"Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Application ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this Phase IIB application, we propose to commercialize and bring to market EyeArt, a fully automated, high throughput, retinal image analysis based diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening tool (which has been developed and already validated in bench tests on very large real-world data) by conducting formal clinical trials and integrating it into several clinical information systems. With its fully automated use, high throughput capability (can analyze several thousands of patient cases in just a few hours), scalable architecture, and ability to seamlessly integrate into clinical workflows, EyeArt will aid the expansion of DR screening and help bridge the exponentially growing disparity between the number of diabetic patients and the number of eye care providers. DR is a common microvascular complication of diabetes affecting 80% of all diabetic patients. Even though vision loss due to DR is preventable by early detection and treatment, it is the one of the leading global causes of preventable blindness primarily due to the lack of easy access to eye care providers. Automated DR screening is the only way to make DR screening more accessible to the large and growing population of diabetic patients, currently 29 million in the US and 387 million world-wide and expected to grow to 110 million and 592 million respectively by 2030.  To help reduce risk of DR vision loss in the diabetic population, EyeArt uses advanced image analysis algorithms to make DR screening more efficient, cost-effective, and more accessible. EyeArt has been validated and shown to have high screening sensitivity (safety) and efficacy on multiple large real-world datasets including one with over 54,000 patient cases (and 434,000 images) obtained from EyePACS, a DR telescreening system with over 360 sites in the US and elsewhere. Eyenuk has received ISO 13485 certification as a medical device manufacturer and EyeArt has received CE Marking and is commercially available in Europe. Going forward, we will clinically validate EyeArt in formal clinical trials and integrate it into clinical informatio systems to enable EyeArt's seamless incorporation into existing clinical workflows. This will pave the way for EyeArt's availability to the US DR screening market and reduce the burden on clinical resources by improving health care productivity. This will help increase the DR screening conformance in the diabetic population and thus help in reducing and ultimately eliminating vision loss due to DR through early detection and treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: EyeArt, a fully automated, high throughput, retinal image analysis based diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening system will help in screening patients in need of expert care thus making DR screening more efficient, cost- effective, and accessible. EyeArt's integration into EyePACS, a DR telescreening system, will facilitate an expansion of DR screening within the large and expanding EyePACs network of primary care centers in the US and elsewhere. We are also collaborating with Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LAC-DHS) which already uses the EyePACS to deploy our system following clinical validation, in their under-resourced safety net teleretinal screening setup which caters to large disparity populations of LA County. The increased access to DR screening will help reduce and ultimately eliminate vision loss due to DR through early detection and treatment.",Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Application,9319270,R44EY026864,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Background Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Blindness', 'Caliber', 'Caring', 'Certification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consult', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Angiopathies', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Europe', 'European', 'Exudate', 'Eye', 'Faculty', 'Felis catus', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Industry', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Italy', 'Lesion', 'Los Angeles', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medicine', 'Observational Study', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retinal', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specificity', 'Surrogate Markers', 'System', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical care', 'cloud based', 'computerized', 'cost effective', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'macular edema', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'safety net', 'screening', 'secondary analysis', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool']",NEI,"EYENUK, INC.",R44,2017,513223,1300000,0.008066537868734307
"Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build and test a dynamic vascular optical tomographic imaging (DVOTI) system that can be used to detect and monitor peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is estimated to affect approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. However, the disease is considerably under-diagnosed, since most patients are asymptomatic and no single reliable screening modality has been established. Most of the undiagnosed and untreated patients are diabetics. They commonly suffer from peripheral neuropathy and hence do not sense and report symptoms (such as pain) that are early signs of the disease. Consequently more than 60% (~65,000 per year) of all lower extremity amputations in the United States are performed in diabetic patients with PAD. With the number of diabetic patients expected to triple and reach almost 100 million by 2050, the problems related to undiagnosed PAD will only rise in the years to come  The most widely used diagnostic test for PAD, determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in conjunction with pulse-volume recordings (PVR), is known to be unreliable for diabetics. And even in non- diabetics, ABI with PVR and all other existing diagnostic tests (such as Duplex Ultrasound or Magnetic resonance angiography), only provides accurate information about proximal occlusions in major arteries of the leg. However, none of these tests assess the distal perfusion of the foot where most complications, such as ulcers and gangrene, typically occur. Monitoring the success of surgical interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, suffers from the same shortcomings, as physicians are limited to the same suite of tests that are inadequate to assess the perfusion of the foot.  Dynamic VOTI promises to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic and monitoring techniques and has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift concerning how vascular diseases are assessed. In preliminary studies we have shown that DVOTI can provide three-dimensional time-series images that provide valuable information about the perfusion of the vascular bed in feet of PAD patients. The near-infrared light used in the instrument has no adverse health effects and measurements can be repeated frequently to monitor post interventional progress. Therefore, we believe that DVOTI will prove to be a safe and accurate method to diagnose and monitor PAD in non-diabetic and diabetic patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build and test a novel optical imaging system that will allow for the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. The disease is considerably under-diagnosed, especially in diabetic patients, the elderly, and patients with kidney disease. The system will address an unmet need to directly assess the degree of blood perfusion in the feet, where most PAD-related complications occur, which lead to over 65,000 amputations each year.",Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease,9338285,R01HL115336,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Anatomy', 'Angioplasty', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Foot Ulcer', 'Gangrene', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preventive measure', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ulcer', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'accurate diagnosis', 'blood perfusion', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'experience', 'foot', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging system', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'light emission', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optical imaging', 'post intervention', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'theories', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'vascular bed']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,557344,558628098,-3.723330983286885e-05
"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We will use a novel statistical approach to develop and validate the models.",Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler,9265960,R01NS082304,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anterior', 'Anterior Horn Cells', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Natural History', 'Neuraxis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Riluzole', 'Spinal', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interest', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'rapid diagnosis', 'response', 'screening', 'spinal tract', 'treatment response', 'treatment trial']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,577180,641965656,-0.014272865804155831
"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will make it possible for a wide community of researchers who collect and analyze medical imaging data to take advantage of a new class of computer algorithms that very accurately label and measure anatomical structures and pathological formations in medical images. By offering more accurate image-derived measurements, the project promises to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, reduce the costs of biomedical re- search studies and pharmaceutical trials, and accelerate scientific discovery.",Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation,9350173,R01EB017255,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Myocardium', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aortic valve', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'cardiovascular visualization', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'multi-atlas segmentation', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted imaging', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,597688,593605914,-0.0039083035635572305
"High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before a heart attack, and predict risk in millions of patients annually. This is currently limited by the need fo visual interpretation, which is highly variable and depends on the physician's experience. The long-term objective of this program is to improve the interpretation of this widely used heart imaging technique-achieving higher accuracy for disease detection than it is possible by the best attainable visual analysis. This proposal builds on our prior work in conventional myocardial MPS, and focuses on fast, low-radiation MPS imaging (fast-MPS) obtained by new high-efficiency scanners. Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS. The algorithms will include better heart muscle detection by training with correlated anatomical data and a novel approach for mapping the probability of abnormal perfusion for each location of the heart muscle; 2) enhance the diagnosis of heart disease from fast-MPS by machine- learning algorithms that integrate clinical data, stress test parameters, and quantitative image features; 3) demonstrate the clinical utility of the new algorithms applied to automatic canceling of the rest portion of the MPS scan, when not needed. The new system will be more accurate than the clinical expert analysis in the detection of obstructive coronary disease. By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,9282634,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collimator', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Stress Tests', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical imaging', 'computer generated', 'cost', 'detector', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'solid state', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,600120,90419233,-0.0077661666671687765
"Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):1 Of all markers of human health, the most intuitive is body shape but based on quantitative evidence.  2 Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio  3 (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality  4 risk than body mass index (BMI). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can quantify regional adiposity in  5 more detail than the above measures but is underutilized for many reasons including potential harm from  6 ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments  7 in the ""quantified self movement"" to better describe phenotypes of body shape and its relation to metabolic  8 risks. The candidate developed in this proposal is 3D optical whole body scanning. If successful, sophisticated  9 obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with 10 disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment 11 technology. Whole body 3D imaging technology is already so accessible that it can be done with video games 12 such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect, and consumer cameras. 13 The long term goal of the Optical Body Shape and Health Assessment Study is 1) to provide phenotype 14 descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in 15 research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive 16 models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, 17 muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat), and then show how our 3DO body composition estimates are 18 associated to important metabolic risk factors. Our central hypothesis is that 3DO measures of body 19 composition with shape classification better predict metabolic risk factors than anthropometry or DXA body 20 composition alone. Our specific aims are: 1. Identify the unique associations of body shape to body 21 composition indices in a population that represents the variance of sex, age, BMI, and ethnicity found 22 in the US population; 2. Describe the precision and accuracy of 3DO scans to monitor change in body 23 composition and metabolic health interventions; and 3. Estimate the level of association of 3DO to 24 common health indicators including metabolic risk factors by gender, race, age, and BMI. In an 25 exploratory aim, we investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct 26 predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class 27 Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self- 28 assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US 29 population, and how these models relate to important metabolic status and body composition. The positive 30 impact will be the immediate applicability to clinicians and individuals for personalized risk assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of who is at high risk of metabolic diseases because of a poor metabolic profile. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults.

"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart transplant (Tx) surgery is a well-established life-saving procedure, but is associated with post- interventional risks such as acute cardiac rejection (ACR) which is one of the leading causes of death in the first year after transplant. Beyond the first year, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the single greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality. Monitoring the patient for post-transplant events is thus paramount. The standard monitoring strategy, however, relies on frequent (12-16 monitoring nodes during year 1 alone) invasive and costly procedures including endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) and catheter angiography. Since EMB and catheter angiography have limited sensitivity due to sampling errors (ACR) or the diffuse nature of the disease (CAV), a reliable non-invasive alternative for the early detection of ACR and CAV would be desirable to reduce the need for invasive procedures, improve sensitivity, and reduce cost. We have recently developed and applied cardiac MRI techniques for the non-invasive assessment of myocardial edema (T2-mapping), diffuse fibrosis (pre- and post-contrast T1-mapping), myocardial velocities (tissue phase mapping), and microvascular quantitative perfusion. We have shown that these techniques can identify distinct regional structural and functional alterations in the heart that correlate with te status of the allograft. Based on these findings, a detailed cost-effective analysis using Markov modeling and decision tree analysis has demonstrated that cardiac MR has tremendous potential to reduce monitoring costs by 40-50% during the first year after Tx alone. This proposal builds on these promising findings and our aim is to develop an new 15-minute structure-function cardiac MRI protocol for the improved detection regional abnormalities associated with ACR (edema, fibrosis, dysfunction) and CAV (perfusion, dysfunction). Integration of MRI with echocardiography and intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) will provide unique multi-modality assessment of the allograft. The application in a longitudinal clinical study coupled with state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis will allow redefining the most effective post-Tx mixed monitoring strategy. The aim is to to help clinicians identify the optimal mixed monitoring strategy, i.e. the optimal combination of multi-modality imaging (structure-function MRI, echo, IVUS) and invasive procedures (EMB, catheter angiography) which provide best outcome (quality adjusted life days) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop a multi-modality imaging protocol for the non-invasive characterization of tissue and function of the left and right heart in patients after heart transplantation. Our aim is to develop a new non- invasive 15 minute diagnostic test in order to provide a previously unattainable quantitative characterization of myocardial structure-function deficits in cardiac transplant patients. The application in a longitudinal clinial study coupled with cost-effectiveness analysis and decision tree modeling will allow to improve current monitoring strategies by combining cardiac MRI, echocardiography, intravascular ultrasound and invasive tests (biopsy, catheter angiography) to provide the best outcome (quality of life days, mortality) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient.",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,9229057,R01HL117888,"['Acute', 'Allografting', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost utility', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrosis', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Myocardial', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling Errors', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'base', 'comparative cost effectiveness', 'cost', 'extracellular', 'follow-up', 'heart allograft', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'post intervention', 'public health relevance', 'standard of care', 'two-arm study']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,680651,367414121,0.011722462868359476
"Shape up! Kids Project Summary/Abstract Of all markers of pediatric health, the most intuitive is body shape. Human and animal studies indicate that weight loss/gain correlates closely with increasing/decreasing insulin sensitivity, respectively. Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality risk than pediatric body mass index Z-score. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can quantify regional adiposity in more detail than these measures but is underutilized for many reasons including the sensitivity to children to ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments in optical technology to better describe phenotypes of pediatric body shape and its relation to metabolic risks (obesity, “failure to thrive”) and bone density and size. If successful, sophisticated obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment technology. The long term goal of the Shape Up! Kids Study is 1) to provide pediatric phenotype descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat) and bone mineral density (BMD) over a wide range of ages (5 to 18 years), weights and heights, stratified by sex, and ethnicity. Our central hypothesis is that optical estimates with shape classification of soft tissue composition and bone density better predict fracture and metabolic risk factors than anthropometry (WC, WHR, and BM) alone. The Investigators will highly leverage existing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Bone Mineral Density in Children Study. Our specific aims are: 1) Identify the unique associations of body shape to body composition and bone density indices in a pediatric population that represents the variance found in the US population, 2) Describe the precision and accuracy of optical scans to monitor change in body composition, bone density, 3) Estimate the level of association of optical scans to common health indicators including metabolic risk factors. Our exploratory aim is to investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self-assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US pediatric population, and to define how these models relate to important metabolic status indicators. The positive impact of these outcomes will be the immediate applicability to other researcher studies and clinicians using the automated tools and models developed here for 3D optical images. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of what children are at high risk of metabolic consequences of obesity. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults, and are becoming epidemic in children as well.

"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more. This will be accomplished by: optimizing the image processing that is used, further developing new and better image processing methods, and developing a method of ""personalized imaging"", in which, for each individual patient, the minimum amount of imaging agent needed to obtain a good image is computed.",Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging,9268035,R01HL122484,"['3D ultrasound', '4D Imaging', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Protection', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radioactive', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'computer program', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging agent', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'perfusion imaging', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2017,770494,8894636,0.005546937946612407
"Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disrupted circadian timing has emerged as a serious health and safety issue, yet there are no objective means of easily assessing circadian timing or alignment without performing a highly controlled, multiple-day in- patient study. Altered circadian timing can cause both sleep loss and sleepiness, cause performance errors such as motor vehicle accidents, and impair memory/learning. Thus, despite the obvious need to recognize an individual's circadian phase/alignment, we cannot assess circadian timing clinically or in retrospective studies. Not surprisingly, the first goal of the 2011 NIH Sleep Disorders Research Plan is to identify: ""...metabolic... biomarkers of sleep deficiency and biological timing...and circadian disorders that will facilitate personalized treatments, and clarify the risk associated with untreated sleep and circadian disorders and disturbances."" We are aware that major challenges face biomarker development, including multi-factorial causes of metabolite shifts normally controlled across multiple time-points. Because circadian time is associated with profound metabolic, immune and cardiovascular changes, however, we hypothesize that a biomarker signature for circadian phase derived from -omic markers can be obtained from a single blood sample. We therefore propose to utilize the analytical and bioinformatics platforms and experience in population-level metabolomics studies in the PIs lab to study banked plasma samples from the well-characterized individuals in six tightly controlled circadian rhythm studies run by the four co-investigators.The Aims are:  Aim 1: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and t cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics-  based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples drawn from three constant routine protocols Aim 2: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and to cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples  drawn from four forced desynchrony protocols  Aim 3: To systematically evaluate the validated profiles from Aims 1 and 2 and their mathematical  similarities and differences so as to improve accuracy and precision of the biomarkers  Aim 4: To test the markers identified above under poorly controlled real world applications Identification of biomarker panels will impact multiple aspects of science and health: (i) contribute to clinical recognition and treatment on circadian disorders; (ii) advance personalized medicine through individualized treatment timing to enhance efficacy/reduce side effects of medications (e.g., chemotherapy); (iii) creating epidemiologic tools to relate circadian with disease risk; and aiding development of other disease biomarkers, and; (iv) contribute to research on circadian biology and its implications for human health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to identify blood-based markers that can inform a clinician or researcher about an individual's internal biological clock. At the broad levels of society and public health research, the work has the potential direct benefit of identifying individuals with ""off-set"" clocks (enabling diagnosis and potential therapy), increasing accuracy and precision of studies of blood lipids, facilitating understanding of certain sleep disorders, increasing understanding of the role of biological clocks in chronic disease processes (e.g., cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease), and potentially improving the administration of certain pharmaceuticals, eg, chemotherapy agents.","Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting",9264015,R01HL132556,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Clocks', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Disease', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Drowsiness', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Memory impairment', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Strigiformes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker identification', 'biomarker panel', 'blood lipid', 'blood-based biomarker', 'chemotherapy', 'combinatorial', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'human population study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'men', 'metabolomics', 'personalized medicine', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'real world application', 'tool', 'vehicular accident']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2017,877276,327644200,-0.0029128369126422593
"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We will use a novel statistical approach to develop and validate the models.",Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler,9052846,R01NS082304,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anterior', 'Anterior Horn Cells', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Natural History', 'Neuraxis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Riluzole', 'Spinal', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interest', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'screening', 'spinal tract', 'treatment response', 'treatment trial']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,1,641965656,-0.014272865804155831
"HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research DESCRIPTION:   My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator who harnesses biomedical Big Data Science for the investigation of multilevel influences on health. To continue my progress towards this goal, I am proposing to build the infrastructure to establish a neighborhood data repository, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers and policy makers. I am a highly trained researcher in social epidemiology and quantitative analyses, particularly large health surveys. Before coming to Utah, I worked as a full-time statistical programmer/data analyst on a NIH-funded project to evaluate the health effects of a large neighborhood relocation policy experiment on low-income families in five cities. Our study results suggested that moving from high- to lower poverty neighborhood is related to reductions in obesity and diabetes and improved mental health. Other extant research has provided evidence on associations between the neighborhood environment and mortality and morbidity-even after adjusting for individual characteristics. Poor access to healthy food, fast food chains, the lack of recreational facilities, and higher crime rates all correlate with hiher obesity rates. Nonetheless, the dearth of neighborhood data, especially measures of neighborhood quality that are consistent across geographic areas, limits neighborhood effects research. Moreover, neighborhoods are not only defined by their resources, but also by the social interactions and activities of people who live there. The widespread usage of the internet and open recording of many transactions has led to the availability of massive amounts of data that permits capture of previously hidden micro-level interactions. We will build the data algorithms and infrastructure to harness relatively untapped, cost efficient, and pervasive social media data to develop neighborhood indicators such as food themes, healthiness of food mentions, frequency of exercise/recreation mentions, metabolic intensity of physical activities, and happiness levels. The creation of HashtagHealth requires the use and refinement of Big Data methods to perform data mining, processing and storing of heterogeneous, unstructured data. We will build a testable version of HashtagHealth for the state of Utah and then apply the data resource to the examination of neighborhood effects on young adult obesity. My rigorous training and previous research experiences in social determinants of health, causal inference, and data analyses uniquely prepare me to make significant contributions to the field of Big Data, particularly at the intersection of public health and social sciences.  My Specific Aims are: 1) to develop a neighborhood data resource, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers, 2) to develop Big Data techniques to produce novel neighborhood quality indicators (e.g., healthiness of food mentions, frequency and type of exercise/recreation and happiness levels), and 3) to utilize HashtagHealth and individual-level data from the Utah Population Database to investigate neighborhood influences on obesity among young adults. My mentorship team includes experts in biomedical research (Drs. Ken Smith, Jim VanDerslice), computer science (Dr. Feifei Li), and statistics (Dr. Ming Wen). My team has the breadth of expertise to help me obtain critical multidisciplinary skills and successfully implement my research aims. In addition to my research aims, my Specific Career Development Aims include the following: 1) to develop expertise in data mining and database systems, 2) to acquire training in natural language processing and machine learning, 3) to further gain knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), 4) to develop expertise in study design and analysis of neighborhood effects, and 5) and to develop grant writing and research management skills to lead future projects. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to successfully compete for R01 funding to create a national neighborhood data repository and to investigate national patterns of neighborhood effects on obesity. This proposal makes significant, relevant contributions to the field because 1) neighborhood environments are increasingly linked to important health outcomes, and 2) this project addresses the limits to research resulting from the lack of neighborhood data by providing new, cost-efficient data resources and methods for characterizing neighborhoods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic rise in obesity and related chronic diseases in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. My overarching career goal is to contribute to the improvement of population health by conducting research in social determinants of health and developing new methodologies to address multidimensional research questions. The development of the Hashtag Health data repository will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of social media data to capture social and cultural processes with potential impact on health.",HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research,9239538,K01ES025433,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Communications Media', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Food Chain', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Database', 'Poverty', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'built environment', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'fast food', 'food consumption', 'health data', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'news', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'research study', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'social media', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'walkability', 'young adult']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2016,36936,228951281,-0.004051781545304218

The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9147601,K01ES026835,"['Affect', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Drug-sensitive', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'improved', 'instructor', 'killings', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'personalized medicine', 'power analysis', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIEHS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2016,49355,551214295,-0.004766401168269072
"Development and Dissemination of MuscleMiner: An Imaging Informatics System for Muscle DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Image evaluation of skeletal muscle biopsies is a procedure essential to research and clinical practice. Although widely used, several major limitations exist with respect to current muscle image morphometric measurement, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, retrieval, and mining procedures: 1) Although traditional morphometric parameters, such as cross-sectional area (CSA) and minimum Feret diameter, etc., serve as critical indicators for assessing muscle function, current measurements are still largely based on manual or semi-automated methods, leading to significant labor costs with large potential inter-observer variability. 2) The current archiving of muscle images is still mainy based on outdated tools such as Excel spreadsheets and computer file folders. Given a new muscle image, it is almost impossible to quickly cross-compare, visualize, query, search, and retrieve previous cases exhibiting similar image contents with comparable morphometric measures, for the purpose of either discovering novel biological co-correlations at benchside, or providing personalized diagnosis and prognosis at bedside. 3) Although a typical muscle image often contains millions of data points (pixels), in clinical practice, doctors often condense this rich information into one or two diagnostic labels and discard the rest. Novel image markers, which are not always apparent through visual inspections or not manually quantifiable, but potentially represent critical diagnostic and prognostic values for precision medicine, have not been rigorously examined. Similarly, in basic science research, only a very limited number of known measures (e.g., CSA) are considered. Some non-traditional measures, such as myofiber shapes that hold the potential to serve as new indicators of muscle functions, are not fully investigated. 4) Current muscle image analysis and searching functions are fairly low throughput. As a frontier research area, Cloud computing can handle big image data in a distributed manner by providing high-throughput computational power. However, its application to muscle images has never been explored. MuscleMiner will provide a complete suite of tools for automated image morphometric measurements, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, content-based image retrieval, bioinformatics image mining, and Cloud computing. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) Develop the automated morphometric measurement unit, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) unit, and the image archiving and visualization unit. 2) Develop the advanced bioinformatics image mining unit to assist in the rapid discovery and validation of new image markers. 3) Develop the Cloud computing unit to enable big image data processing and searching functions. Disseminate this freely available, Cloud-enabled imaging informatics system to muscle research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose to develop and disseminate an advanced Cloud-enabled imaging informatics tool - MuscleMiner. MuscleMiner will provide a complete suite of tools for automated image morphometric measurements, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, content-based image retrieval, and bioinformatics image mining. The goal of MuscleMiner is to offer a freely available and powerful tool to help all clinician and basic scienc muscle researchers in their daily work. Beyond fast, objective, reproducible, and automated morphometric measurements, the impact of MuscleMiner will be multiplied by laboratories using the CBIR and visualization units (Aim 1), bioinformatics image mining unit (Aim 2), and Cloud-computing unit (Aim 3) to deeply mine and fully utilize the rich information embedded in large collections of muscle images.",Development and Dissemination of MuscleMiner: An Imaging Informatics System for Muscle,9282051,R01AR065479,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Cells', 'Client', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Fascicle', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Shapes', 'Slide', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'System', 'Technology', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical practice', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'frontier', 'image archival system', 'image visualization', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'muscular system', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized diagnostics', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic value', 'skeletal', 'tool', 'wasting']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2016,58482,188894159,-0.006958013673455607
"SCH: Proactive Health Monitoring Using Individualized Analysis of Tissue Elastic* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Existing studies suggest that tissue elasticity is possibly correlated with the aggressiveness of cancers. Based on results from deformable image registration, the proposed project investigates the possibility of tracking the organs movement subject to external forces and geometric constraints, thereby deducing patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters for proactive health monitoring. The objectives of this exploratory research project are (1) to develop a computational framework based on extensive studies of a large cohort of cancer patients, in order to accurately estimate patent-specific tissu elasticity using a coupled biomechanical simulation-optimization framework on a pair of medical images (possibly from ultrasound, mammography, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, or other imaging technologies); (2) to examine potential association between tissue elasticity in different regions with aggressiveness of know/diagnosed cancer in the corresponding regions; (3) to derive predictive models for cancer staging/grading based on recovered patient-specific tissue elasticity and other explanatory variables; (4) to design a health monitoring system based on individualized analysis of tissue elasticity for 'at-risk' groups  who are more likely to develop cancers. This proposal describes a truly ambitious effort and a bold vision that is built upon the investigators' prior scientific accomplishments and strong credentials to potentially transform existing practice to more proactive, preventive, evidence-based health monitoring for individuals at risk of developing cancers. This research is expected to make several major scientific advances. These include new algorithms for non-invasive, image-based techniques for automatic extraction of tissue elasticity parameters without force applications and/or force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new predictive models for cancer staging and grading based on patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters, and a health monitoring system for at-risk groups based on individual tissue elasticity along with other variables. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Other than health monitoring, the patient-specific tissue parameters can be incorporated into medical simulators to perform patient-specific surgical planning, compute desired force-feedback for tele-surgery, design and prototype medical devices, and conduct virtual surgical training. The statistical inference techniques developed can be applicable to genetic epidemiology, health economics, and bioinformatics.",SCH: Proactive Health Monitoring Using Individualized Analysis of Tissue Elastic*,9103112,R01EB020426,"['Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Tests', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancerous', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Elastic Tissue', 'Elasticity', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Health', 'Hepatitis', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Life Style', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Mammary Ultrasonography', 'Mammography', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physicians', 'Preventive', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Prostate', 'Radiation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Screening for cancer', 'Second Primary Cancers', 'Societies', 'Staging', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor stage', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Virus Diseases', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aging population', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'design', 'evidence base', 'genetic epidemiology', 'health economics', 'image registration', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'malignant stomach neoplasm', 'men', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prostate biopsy', 'prototype', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2016,60647,511185245,-0.02060023687787668
"QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tissue identification and quantification plays a significant role in the study of aging and age-related diseases. For example, the accumulation of fat in the human body and its regional distribution with aging is associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Changes in muscle composition are strongly linked to decline of muscle strength, decreased mobility caused by aging, or musculoskeletal disorders. Especially interesting is analysis of longitudinal changes of morphometric descriptors that is significant for studying the aging process and for the diagnosis and prevention of age-related diseases.  Medical imaging has emerged as a major tool for estimation of body composition mainly due to being non- invasive and producing multi-dimensional information. Nowadays MRI and CT acquisition is a central component of clinical trials. An abundance of imaging data is collected, but this wealth of information has not been utilized to full extent. Therefore research on image analysis techniques for tissue quantification that are reproducible and can be used on large-scale clinical trials is of particular importance.  The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse body composition data from modern MRI and CT imaging. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that qualitative body composition phenotypes on clinical imaging will differentiate individuals who are healthy versus those who are not. The goal of our work is to provide a foundation for image analysis of the abdomen and lower extremities and to study the relationship between body morphological changes and age-related pathologies.  We will build upon recent advances in medical image computing to segment muscle, regional adipose tissue, and bone in clinical CT and MRI scans. We will also develop image registration procedures to achieve intra- and inter-subject correspondence and make efficient use of information provided by multi-modal and multi-temporal imaging data collected in clinical trials (aim 1). After these methods have been developed, we will address the hypothesis that quantitative use of clinical imaging can increase the prognostic accuracy of age-related pathologies (aim2). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age-related diseases such as type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and sarcopenia have become a worldwide epidemic and affect the quality of life of millions. To give a global perspective, roughly 343.8 million people in the world have type-2 diabetes today, and 175 million don't know they have diabetes at all. Metabolic diseases are strongly linked to longitudinal changes in body composition, morphology and function. This project will contribute novel and non-invasive medical image analysis techniques for studying the human body composition and its changes with increasing age to achieve timely prognosis of these pathologies.",QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES,9044803,SC3GM113754,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delaware', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Role', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Techniques', 'Thigh structure', 'Tissues', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age related', 'biophysical model', 'bone', 'effective therapy', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'morphometry', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'reduced muscle strength', 'sarcopenia', 'statistics', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY,SC3,2016,63620,4139254,0.007253671986119038
"Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis Abstract The target users of the proposed Slicer+PLUS framework are researchers and developers who are focusing on low-cost point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications. POCUS applications are characterized by utilizing low-cost, portable U/S systems; in the hands of novice operators; with novel data acquisition, signal processing, and machine learning methods; with imprecise trackers; and in highly unconstrained point-of-care environments, e.g.: at the scene of accidents for patient triage, in the offices of general practitioners for scoliosis detection and monitoring, in patients' homes for an aging population, as well as throughout hospitals. In these contexts, many are considering POCUS devices to be the stethoscopes of the future.  The foundation of Slicer+PLUS is the integration and extension of 3D Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. We are the developers of these libraries. We, and the users of our libraries, are proposing Slicer+PLUS so that the Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC communities can come together and cohesively address the important challenges and opportunities posed by POCUS applications. Over 30 letters of support are included with this application.  3D Slicer is a world-class, freely available open-source platform for medical image segmentation, registration, and visualization. PLUS is a world-class, open-source library for communicating with ultrasound machines and trackers (for following objects in 3D using magnetic, optical, and other technologies). MUSiiC is a (previously closed source) library that focuses on advanced ultrasound acquisition and analysis methods, such as ultrasound reconstruction pipelines, elastography, and photoacoustic imaging. Together, these toolkits have averaged over 5,100 downloads per month for the past year.  A central tenant of our work is that POCUS applications should not be viewed as simply involving the use of inexpensive, portable U/S systems; POCUS must be viewed as a new modality for it to attain its full potential. POCUS must involve innovative, automated data analysis methods and workflows that can guide a user to properly place and manipulate an ultrasound probe and interpret the returned ultrasound data. In particular, the output of those workflows and analyses should be quantitative measures, not b-mode images, since the expertise to interpret such images will not be readily available at points-of-care. To that end, the proposed work goes well beyond simple integration of Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. Multiple innovations are proposed such as Ultrasound Spectroscopy for tissue labeling, Dynamic Textures for anatomic localization of ultrasound probes, and self-tracking ultrasound probes.  To assess our progress towards our goals, our team includes our target users: researchers, medical device manufacturers, and clinical innovators dedicated to low-cost POCUS applications. They will be validating our efforts by integrating them into their research and translational POCUS product development projects. Project Narrative  Low-cost ultrasound probes have the potential to become the stethoscopes of the future and revolutionize in-field and in-hospital patient care. Our goal is to integrate, enhance, and disseminate three cutting edge ultrasound acquisition, analysis, and display toolkits to create a new framework called Slicer+PLUS that will serve as a catalyst for research and product development into low-cost point-of-care ultrasound applications. In particular, our framework will include and facilitate innovative methods for guiding a novice user in ultrasound probe placement and for automatically interpreting ultrasound data to provide a diagnosis, without the user having to interpret a traditional B-mode ultrasound image at any point in the process. The Slicer+PLUS framework will be validated using tasks associated with (a) emergency service personnel performing Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exams at the scene of an accident to detect or rule-out intra-abdominal bleeding; (b) the clinical monitoring of scoliosis progression in children in general practitioners' offices; and (c) the translation of research into regulatory-approved products based on Slicer+PLUS.","Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis",9176982,R01EB021396,"['Abdomen', 'Accidents', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blood', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Shapes', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stethoscopes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Trauma', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'aging population', 'base', 'catalyst', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'elastography', 'emergency service responder', 'hospital patient care', 'image guided therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'open source', 'photoacoustic imaging', 'point of care', 'product development', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'scoliosis', 'signal processing', 'software development', 'transmission process']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R01,2016,100000,5161939,0.008341817331784556
"Prediction of IPF Progression Using Imaging Patterns ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of unknown etiology occurring in older adults. IPF is ultimately fatal with a median survival of 2 to 5 years, and exhibits a highly heterogeneous natural history. Broad categories of disease progression have been defined, but are not predictable at the time of diagnosis. These designations of natural history assume great importance at a time when insights from preclinical studies are beginning to translate into therapies targeted at specific key pathways of fibrosis. Stratification of disease phenotypes is important in order to decipher the effects of newly approved therapies among individuals with biologically dissimilar natural histories and to better tailor therapy to individual patients.  Various prognostic tools have been developed for IPF that correlate with overall survival; most use clinical and functional variables independent of imaging findings. Prognostic determinants based on imaging features rely largely on subjective visual assessment of disease. In contrast, no good early predictive models exist that anticipate the natural history of disease in advance of significant functional decline. Given the indispensable role of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in the diagnosis and surveillance of IPF, we propose to mine the rich information in HRCT data sets to develop robust, quantitative features that can anticipate disease progression in advance of debilitating respiratory compromise. We propose to use the anonymized clinical data and source images on 234 patients with IPF from multicenter trials, and whose data are archived at the UCLA Computer Vision and Imaging Biomarkers Laboratory. Using an image processing pipeline developed in our laboratory for quantitative image analysis, we will train a classifier on scans annotated manually by an expert radiologist, analyzing in separate aims static image features present on baseline scans and transitional (difference) morphologic features on sequential scans that herald progressive disease. Features of anatomic distribution will be explored and reproducible imaging features will be expressed with a quantitative lung fibrosis (QLF) score. Aggregate prognostic models using Cox proportional regression models will be derived using only clinical covariates and combined clinical and imaging covariates, correlating these models with progression free survival. Finally, we will externally validate our models in an independent institutional registry of clinical and image data on patients with IPF seen in the UCLA Interstitia Lung Disease Program.  Our objectives are centered on the goals of using preexisting datasets to develop clinically meaningful models that anticipate disease course in patients with IPF. We anticipate that these models can be used clinically at the individual patient level to enable more informed and timely management decisions for the choice in treatment as well as future research to define more homogeneous cohorts for testing new safe and effective therapies and to better elucidate the effects of therapies in patients with biologically heterogeneous disease progression. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of older adults that now has a few treatment options: The natural history of IPF and its rates of progression are highly variable, which hampers timely decisions about referral for lung transplantation or treatments using newer drug therapies. This research takes advantage of clinical and imaging datasets previously collected for research or clinical purposes, and will define image features using computer analysis of computed tomography (CT) images to predict disease course in advance of respiratory deterioration. The success of this research will enable us to distinguish between patients with slowly versus rapidly progressive disease, leading to more timely management decisions, and may help us to understand which patients might benefit from novel promising therapies or treatments and which may not.",Prediction of IPF Progression Using Imaging Patterns,9122467,R21HL123477,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Biopsy', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Derivation procedure', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hamman-Rich syndrome', 'Health', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Natural History', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Progressive Disease', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Stable Disease', 'Stratification', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'data archive', 'digital imaging', 'disease classification', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'effective therapy', 'functional decline', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interstitial', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'preclinical study', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'pulmonary function', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'respiratory', 'success', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2016,107290,673201228,-0.006825465884250124
"Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 award will support my development as an independent investigator with a translational research program that specializes in the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Candidate: My research experience as a cognitive neuroscientist ideally positions me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise on the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative disease. I have strong cognitive training with an M.Sc in Psycholinguistics and Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where I was supported by an NRSA Individual Predoctoral Award. During my postdoctoral IGERT fellowship at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I was awarded an NRSA Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship Award to investigate the role of decision-making in language. In this research I have gained experience investigating neurodegenerative disease patients comparatively in order to obtain converging evidence to complement fMRI studies of healthy adults. I have become increasingly interested in translating my research to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. I was recently award the Society for the Neurobiology of Language Postdoctoral Merit Award in recognition of my novel research investigating how social limitations in patients contribute to difficulty in discourse. I have committed to four years of clinical research the NIH Loan Repayment Program, and I intend to commit to clinical research for the duration of my career. I have learned that cognitive and neuroimaging studies provide only one perspective on neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal, I plan to gain the necessary expertise in biological aspects of FTLD and related conditions to complement my past experiences, and thus achieve my goal of becoming a multifaceted independent investigator with expertise in the cognitive and biological basis for neurodegenerative diseases. With the support of this K01, I will develop expertise to conduct investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, and neuropathological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. I will ultimately integrate the biological expertise gained in this proposal with language studies from my cognitive neuroscience research in an effort to identify non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to screen patients for clinical trials and to measure the efficacy of disease-modifying agents. Environment: This award will be conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Neurology, the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR), and the Penn Bioinformatics Center where I have strong institutional support. The proposed institution is an exceptional environment that has expert centers for neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, a leading genetic research core, expert neuropathology, outstanding biostatisical support, and relevant clinical research laboratories. The University of Pennsylvania is unique in comparison to other institutions in the country because all of the above methods are available in one center. My mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentor, Dr. John Trojanowksi, have international reputations for neurodegenerative disease research. My career development will also be supported by my co-mentor, Dr. Lyle Ungar, who has extensive expertise in statistical learning algorithms and in the analysis of proteomic and genomics datasets. Together, this mentorship team will facilitate my development as an independent investigator by providing access to existing and future collaborators, laboratory resources, and exceptional training environments. The CNDR is a world- leading center for neurodegenerative disease research with human and animal models of disease and exceptional translational science. Biofluid biomarker experience is extensive, and several national biofluid cores are centered at Penn (e.g. ADNI). There is a wealth of internationally-recognized neuroimaging expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Imaging and Computer Science Laboratory, and I will benefit by integrating neuroimaging resources from these facilities with other modalities of biomarker research. Training: I will develop my expertise in the biological basis of neurodegenerative disease with the support of my mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentors, Dr. John Trojanowski and Dr. Lyle Ungar. Specifically, with Dr. Trojanowksi I will engage in training related to biofluid and genetic biomarkers of FTLD. I will develop advanced neuroimaging skills and cutting-edge biostatistical methods with Dr. Ungar. Each of these training modalities will be supported by complementary formal coursework, participation in seminars, attendance of conferences, and regularly scheduled meetings with mentorship team. Research: FTLD is a neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 15 out of 100,000 individuals. In recent years detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have demonstrated distinct sources of histopathological abnormalities in FTLD, including the presence of tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). However, there are currently no in vivo methods for discriminating between FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. There is an urgent need to improve the in vivo diagnosis of FTLD to appropriately enter patients into emerging clinical trials, and to develop sensitive and specific endpoints in trials that can quantify response to these treatments. The overall research aim of this proposal is to develop multimodal methods to improve in vivo diagnosis of FTLD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) affects approximately 15 out of 100,000 adults. Detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have identified two distinct sources of histopathological changes that contribute to FTLD. However, there are currently no in vivo methods for diagnosing pathological subtypes of FTLD. There is an urgent need to identify in vivo diagnosis methods to facilitate the identification of appropriate patients to enter into emerging disease-modifying drug treatment trials. The overall aim of this project is to identify multimodal biomarkers of FTLD.",Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration,9068732,K01AG043503,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Comparative Study', 'Complement', 'Country', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Research', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pathology', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Proxy', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Psychology', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive training', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome wide association study', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'pre-doctoral', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'social', 'symposium', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2016,128358,593605914,-0.00040268900601256416
"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life. This research will also provide quantitative outcome measures that may be used in future clinical trials.",Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS,9164916,K01HD088762,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Equilibrium', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'FMR1', 'FMR1 Premutation', 'FXTAS', 'Family', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'data management', 'design', 'disability', 'disabling symptom', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'gait examination', 'improved', 'instrument', 'male', 'men', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'sensor', 'sex']",NICHD,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2016,131004,55098220,-0.007462296008268733
"Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career transition award will provide the applicant with protected research time to develop an independent research career in biomedical informatics. Dr. Starkey received his M.D. in 2003 from UT Southwestern, completed the NLM Biomedical Informatics Training Program post-doctoral fellowship in 2011 and earned a Ph.D. focusing on clinical informatics from the Clinical Sciences Degree Program at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston in 2012. Dr. Starkey accepted a faculty position at the Institute for Translational Sciences at UTMB that is currently supporting his transition to independent investigator. Dr. Starkey will utilize the career transition award for novel applications of advanced machine learning methods to create predictive models of disease. Predictive models of disease allow for the stratification of risk and prevention of disease and have been successfully implemented in the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. Predictive models of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are an active area of research since CKD is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and end-stage renal disease. However, there is not a single predictive model of CKD created for application to Hispanics and the external validity of existing models is poor. The objective of this project is to create predictive models of chronic kidney disease in a Hispanic population and quantify biomarkers of chronic kidney disease using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomics in this minority population. MRM proteomics will utilize the UTMB Novel Methodologies core and its array of resources to create an inter-institutional collaboration. Heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods will be used to create the predictive model of chronic kidney disease in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC). Established in 2004, the CCHC is a random population sample in Brownsville, Texas created to evaluate the determinants of health in a US/Mexico border population that is primarily of Hispanic ethnicity. The CCHC has an extremely high prevalence of obesity and diabetes at 49.7% and 30.3%, respectively. Both obesity and diabetes are independent risk factors for the development of CKD and represent significant health disparities in the Hispanic population. Archived serum samples of CCHC participants and the CCHC database will be utilized to complete the following aims: 1) Create predictive models of CKD in a Hispanic population 2) Refine the predictive models by including clinical laboratory data and a selective reaction monitoring mass spectrometry panel of biomarkers. At the completion of this project, predictive models of CKD applicable to a Hispanic population will be created and MRM proteomics will demonstrate utility of biomarkers identified in other populations. The application of the results will be used to create clinical tools for CKD risk and guide future studies in this Hispanic population with health disparities. Importantly, it will provide a career transition for D. Starkey to demonstrate the knowledge gained during his training that results in impactful research and publications. PROJECT NARRATIVE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because it allows stratification of chronic kidney disease risk and quantifies biomarkers of chronic kidney disease in the Hispanic minority whom has significant health disparities with regard to kidney disease. The translation of selective reaction monitoring of biomarkers and development of heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods for application to the prediction of chronic kidney disease in a minority population supports the NLM mission.",Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population,9121614,K22LM011869,"['Age', 'Albumins', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Career Mobility', 'Career Transition Award', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'County', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Degree program', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Household', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specimen', 'Stratification', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Work', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker panel', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'learning strategy', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'multiple reaction monitoring', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool', 'urinary']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K22,2016,135270,98796731,-0.0009514724677320882
"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes. Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection,9108235,K23AI097225,"['Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Area', 'Aspergillosis', 'Aspergillus', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breath Tests', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Dolin', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Exhalation', 'Fingerprint', 'Fusarium', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Mucorales', 'Mucormycosis', 'Mycoses', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scedosporium', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Glutamate', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Spectrometry', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The science of Mycology', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vial device', 'Vocational Guidance', 'Woman', 'Work', 'air sampling', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cooking', 'data mining', 'diagnostic assay', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'microbial', 'mid-career faculty', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'training opportunity', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2016,137160,327644200,0.0007737479008024604
"HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research DESCRIPTION:   My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator who harnesses biomedical Big Data Science for the investigation of multilevel influences on health. To continue my progress towards this goal, I am proposing to build the infrastructure to establish a neighborhood data repository, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers and policy makers. I am a highly trained researcher in social epidemiology and quantitative analyses, particularly large health surveys. Before coming to Utah, I worked as a full-time statistical programmer/data analyst on a NIH-funded project to evaluate the health effects of a large neighborhood relocation policy experiment on low-income families in five cities. Our study results suggested that moving from high- to lower poverty neighborhood is related to reductions in obesity and diabetes and improved mental health. Other extant research has provided evidence on associations between the neighborhood environment and mortality and morbidity-even after adjusting for individual characteristics. Poor access to healthy food, fast food chains, the lack of recreational facilities, and higher crime rates all correlate with hiher obesity rates. Nonetheless, the dearth of neighborhood data, especially measures of neighborhood quality that are consistent across geographic areas, limits neighborhood effects research. Moreover, neighborhoods are not only defined by their resources, but also by the social interactions and activities of people who live there. The widespread usage of the internet and open recording of many transactions has led to the availability of massive amounts of data that permits capture of previously hidden micro-level interactions. We will build the data algorithms and infrastructure to harness relatively untapped, cost efficient, and pervasive social media data to develop neighborhood indicators such as food themes, healthiness of food mentions, frequency of exercise/recreation mentions, metabolic intensity of physical activities, and happiness levels. The creation of HashtagHealth requires the use and refinement of Big Data methods to perform data mining, processing and storing of heterogeneous, unstructured data. We will build a testable version of HashtagHealth for the state of Utah and then apply the data resource to the examination of neighborhood effects on young adult obesity. My rigorous training and previous research experiences in social determinants of health, causal inference, and data analyses uniquely prepare me to make significant contributions to the field of Big Data, particularly at the intersection of public health and social sciences.  My Specific Aims are: 1) to develop a neighborhood data resource, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers, 2) to develop Big Data techniques to produce novel neighborhood quality indicators (e.g., healthiness of food mentions, frequency and type of exercise/recreation and happiness levels), and 3) to utilize HashtagHealth and individual-level data from the Utah Population Database to investigate neighborhood influences on obesity among young adults. My mentorship team includes experts in biomedical research (Drs. Ken Smith, Jim VanDerslice), computer science (Dr. Feifei Li), and statistics (Dr. Ming Wen). My team has the breadth of expertise to help me obtain critical multidisciplinary skills and successfully implement my research aims. In addition to my research aims, my Specific Career Development Aims include the following: 1) to develop expertise in data mining and database systems, 2) to acquire training in natural language processing and machine learning, 3) to further gain knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), 4) to develop expertise in study design and analysis of neighborhood effects, and 5) and to develop grant writing and research management skills to lead future projects. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to successfully compete for R01 funding to create a national neighborhood data repository and to investigate national patterns of neighborhood effects on obesity. This proposal makes significant, relevant contributions to the field because 1) neighborhood environments are increasingly linked to important health outcomes, and 2) this project addresses the limits to research resulting from the lack of neighborhood data by providing new, cost-efficient data resources and methods for characterizing neighborhoods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic rise in obesity and related chronic diseases in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. My overarching career goal is to contribute to the improvement of population health by conducting research in social determinants of health and developing new methodologies to address multidimensional research questions. The development of the Hashtag Health data repository will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of social media data to capture social and cultural processes with potential impact on health.",HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research,9096792,K01ES025433,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Communications Media', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Food Chain', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Database', 'Poverty', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'built environment', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'fast food', 'food consumption', 'health data', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'news', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'research study', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'social media', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'walkability', 'young adult']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2016,155914,228951281,-0.004051781545304218
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,9084432,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Eotaxin', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2016,156324,507546965,-0.021467823945147596
"Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During medical imaging, patient motion is virtually unavoidable presenting a significant source of image degradation and artifacts, which in turn, can impact the quality of care received by many patients. One method used to address patient motion is to employ visual tracking systems (VTS), which involves placing a small number of reflective markers on the patient that can be located and tracked in 3D space using stereo cameras. The tracked markers can then be used as a surrogate to a structure of interest, such as the heart. The tracked surrogate provides a quantifiable measure that can be directly correlated with the motion of the target structure, which can then be used for prospective or retrospective motion correction. However, the markers add complexity to patient workflow, provide only a sparse sampling of the patient's surface, and the optimal number and placement of markers is unknown. This project addresses the shortcomings of marker-based VTS systems by proposing to develop and test a novel low-cost marker-less VTS system for tracking patient motion within a hybrid imaging system. The primary barrier for successfully tracking the patient's body surface using marker-less VTS is that clothing prevents an unobstructed view of the patient's body. The candidate, Dr. Lindsay, is proposing to incorporate a translational method using computational approaches to compensate for garments within the proposed marker-less VTS system. Dr. Lindsay has received training in computer science and computer vision and previously has focused on the computational aspects of capturing, modeling, and rendering of physical phenomena such as light and is proposing to extend this knowledge to the medical imaging field. Dr. Lindsay's goals for this proposal are to acquire the necessary training and skills that will allow him to translate his expertise and existing computational skills to an area f research with medical relevance: namely, detecting and tracking patient motion for the purpose of improving motion correction for hybrid- imaging. Dr. Lindsay's long-term career goal is to become an accomplished independent investigator focusing on solving significant problems in medical imaging by translating advances in Computer Science. The proposed work will take place the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (UMass) in Worcester, MA under the primary mentorship of Dr. Michael King, an internationally known expert in the area of medical imaging and medical physics in Nuclear Medicine. Drs. Gennert, Sullivan, Licho have expertise in computer vision, mechanical engineering and medical imaging, and radiology and Nuclear Medicine, respectively will also serve as co-mentors.  The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) develop a novel marker-less VTS, which we call PT- Cam, using low-cost using state-of-the-art camera technology, 2) model surface motion as a surrogate for internal motion of the heart, and 3) conduct tests of the PT-Cam system, in order to determine the acceptability and feasibility of clinical usage, on patients undergoing clinical MPI PET/CT imaging. Thus, the main objective of this program of research is to develop a clinically viable method for motion tracking patients undergoing hybrid-imaging studies by using a novel marker-less surface-tracking method that can compensate for clothing and provide modeling of interior motion of structures from surface tracking. If successful, not only will this project provide an innovative, marker-less VTS system for low-cost surface tracking for motion compensation during hybrid imaging but it will also give the candidate the necessary training needed to become an independent investigator in the medical field and potentially a leader in the field of medical imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 7.2 million people per year die world-wide from coronary artery disease (CAD), and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become a critical tool for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment of CAD. During medical imaging such as MPI, patient motion is virtually unavoidable and presents a significant source of image degradation and it has been suggested that upwards of 40% of cardiac studies in PET are effected by some type of motion with similar findings for SPECT. The proposed project will directly address the shortcomings of previous methods for tracking patient motion by developing and testing a novel low-cost marker-less visual tracking system for patient motion within hybrid imaging.",Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging,9132242,K25EB019032,"['Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Body Surface', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clothing', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marketing', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Optics', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Security', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'heart motion', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'skills', 'skills training', 'success', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'visual tracking', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K25,2016,169609,294146927,0.007073570161482853
"The Role of the Microbiome in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K23 proposal will complete Robert Dickson, MD's training towards his long-term career goal of improving our understanding and treatment of lung disease by investigation of the microbiome. Dr. Dickson is a Pulmonary and Critical Care physician and scientist at the University of Michigan with established success in the burgeoning field of lung microbiome studies. This proposal builds on Dr. Dickson's previously acquired expertise in pulmonary pathophysiology and microbial ecology with new training in clinical research methods and computational biology. These established and newly-acquired skills will be integrated to improve our understanding of the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). This research will be conducted under the guidance of primary mentor Gary B. Huffnagle PhD, co- mentor Theodore J. Standiford MD and an advisory board of accomplished investigators with expertise in clinical research methods, computational biology and lung immunology as well as extensive mentoring success. This 5-year plan includes formal coursework, professional development, and progressively independent research, with defined milestones to ensure productivity and a successful transition to independence. The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expense, responsible for an estimated 74,500 U.S. deaths per year. Numerous studies have identified indirect evidence of translocation of bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the lung in patients at risk for ARDS, but to date no study has evaluated the role of microbiome in the pathogenesis of ARDS. This proposal will test the hypothesis that translocation of gut bacteria to the lung provokes the inflammation and injury of ARDS via two specific Scientific Aims. Aim 1 will determine if translocation of enteric bacteria to the lung microbiome precedes the clinical development of ARDS, and Aim 2 will determine the temporal relationship between respiratory dysbiosis, host inflammation and the clinical onset of ARDS. Inherent to completing these high-level aims, Dr. Dickson will execute a prospective cohort study of patients at high risk for ARDS, utilize modern culture-independent techniques of bacterial identification to describe the bacterial communities in the lungs and gastrointestinal tracts of high-risk patients, and apply novel techniques of advanced computational modeling to the complex nonlinear system of ARDS pathogenesis. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: 1) to determine if the lung microbiome contributes to disease progression among patients with established ARDS and 2) to determine if the lung microbiome can be therapeutically manipulated in critically ill patients to prevent or modulate respiratory disease. n addition to building a foundation for a programmatic line of research to understand the role of the microbiome in lung disease, this proposal will provide Dr. Dickson with research skills applicable to additional domains of human microbiome and ARDS research. This K23 award will equip Dr. Dickson to establish himself as an independent investigator and international leader in this promising field.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expense, responsible for an estimated 74,500 U.S. deaths per year; the National Institutes of Health have identified the prevention and early treatment of ARDS as a research priority. We lack an understanding of the pathogenesis of ARDS, impeding our ability to predict and prevent its onset. Determination of the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of ARDS would both 1) improve our ability to predict the onset of ARDS, enabling targeted preventive interventions and 2) identify novel therapeutic targets at the microbiome/host interface in patients at risk for ARDS.        ",The Role of the Microbiome in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,9013900,K23HL130641,"['Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Alveolar', 'Bacteria', 'Catecholamines', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early treatment', 'Ecology', 'Ensure', 'Enteral', 'Enterobacter', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Epinephrine', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gammaproteobacteria', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immigration', 'Immunology', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Non-linear Models', 'Norepinephrine', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Pseudomonas', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical risk', 'cytokine', 'gastrointestinal', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'skills', 'success']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2016,171176,641965656,0.006429732484210478
"Improving cancer family history collection through social networking and artificial intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY  The  activities  proposed  in  this  NCI  K07  application  are  designed  to  advance  the  career  development  and  research  independence  of  Dr.  Brandon  M.  Welch.  Family  health  history  (FHx)  is  one  of  the most important  resources available to help clinicians identify disease risks. By knowing a patient's FHx, clinicians can quickly  identify  disease risks and initiate risk-reducing strategies such as increased screening, prophylactic surgery,  risk-reducing  therapeutics,  and  lifestyle  changes.  FHx  is  also  the  foundation  of  genomic  medicine.  Unfortunately,  the  collection  and  use  of  FHx  by  patients  and  clinicians  is  suboptimal.  To  improve  the  collection and use of FHx among the general population, a better FHx tool that is easier and more convenient  to  use  than  current  FHx  tools  is  needed.  A  new  FHx  web  tool,  called  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com,​  incorporates  artificial intelligence and social networking to improve user engagement with FHx collection.Utilizing artificial  intelligence  based  chat  entity  can  improve  the  collection  of  FHx  information  by  making  it  easier  and  more  engaging to record FHx information, likewise social networking allows users to tap into the collective wisdom  and  knowledge  of  the  family  to  correct  inaccuracies  and  overcome  gaps  in  FHx  knowledge.  This research  study  will  first  identify  enhancements  to  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com  ​that  will  further  promote  user  engagement,  with  particular  focus  on  rural and underserved patients (Aim 1). We will then evaluate whether this new FHx  tool can improve collection of cancer FHx in comparison with current FHx tools (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess  the impact of ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com ​on the clinical settings (Aim 3). To implement the research plan, it will be  critical  to  apply,  skills  obtained  through  K  award  learning  objectives,  namely  clinical  oncology  (learning  objective  1),  iterative  patient-centered  design  (learning  objective  2),  and  health  technology  assessment  (learning  objective  3).  To  fulfill  these  learning  objectives,  an  interdisciplinary  group  of  mentors  will  direct  a  comprehensive training plan. The training plan includes coursework, seminars, workshops, journal clubs, and  conferences,  covering clinical oncology, patient engagement, health disparities, user-centered development,  human-computer  interaction,  clinical  research  methodologies,  health  technology  assessment,  and  ethical  conduct  of  research.  The  strong  support  of  an  excellent  team  of  mentors,  and  the  vast  resources  of  the  Medical  University  of  South  Carolina,  create  an  optimal  training  environment.  Collectively,  the  integrated  learning  objectives  and  research  plan  are  critical  to  establishing  a  successful,  innovative,  and  meaningful  academic career focused on developing patient-centric informatics tools for oncology.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Family health history (FHx) is one of the most important risk factors for cancer and the foundation of genomic medicine, but is under-utilized by patients and clinicians.

"Deep learning for representation of codes used for SEER-Medicare claims research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose developing an algorithm and user-friendly software to better identify treatments using Medicare claims data. We will validate our approach using procedures listed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database as a gold standard. In this way, we hope to better match procedures identified using Medicare claims data with SEER listed procedures.  The focus of this research is observational (i.e. non-randomized) data. Well-run randomized clinical trials can provide the best level of evidence of treatment effects. However, randomized trials in the United States have suffered from poor accrual for many interventions. Despite the fact that well-designed randomized clinical trials should be the gold standard, well-designed observational studies might be the only method of obtaining inferences concerning comparative effectiveness for some cancer interventions.  In cancer research, one of the most commonly used databases for observational research is the linked SEER-Medicare database. SEER-Medicare data has provided useful measurements of the effectiveness of a number of cancer therapies. Algorithms for identifying relevant treatment and diagnosis codes using Medicare data are often based on clinical reasoning and scientific evidence. One group of researchers, for example, developed an algorithm for identifying laparoscopic surgery among kidney cancer cases before claims codes for laparoscopic surgery were well developed. While such algorithms are useful for others pursuing similar investigations, there may still be substantial mismatch between treatment identified by the SEER cancer registry and treatment identified through Medicare claims. In this work, we propose developing a rigorous machine learning algorithm that can help researchers in better identifying treatments in Medicare claims data. Specifically, we will design a neural language modeling algorithm and implement a software system that finds vector representations of diagnosis and procedure codes.  We plan on using the neural language modeling algorithm to learn vector representations from SEER- Medicare claims data where related procedure and diagnosis codes are ""neighbors"" (i.e. closely related). We will investigate whether the codes we identify within neighborhoods correspond to the procedure codes used for published SEER-Medicare studies. We will then design a software assistant interface that will allow an investigator to explore which codes are related to a given seed of diagnosis or procedure codes. Finally, we will investigate the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm by comparing procedures identified using Medicare claims with procedures listed in the SEER database. We will replicate analyses from a published SEER-Medicare paper to investigate if estimated treatment effects differ when using our novel algorithm compared to using the algorithm in the published paper.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In cancer research, one of the most commonly used databases for observational research is the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. To improve the identification of procedures when using Medicare claims data, we will design a software assistant interface that will allow an investigator to explore which codes are related to a given seed of diagnosis or procedure codes. This should improve the identification of procedures when using Medicare claims data, and make conclusions drawn from analyses using the database more reliable and consistent.            ",Deep learning for representation of codes used for SEER-Medicare claims research,9023921,R21CA202130,"['Algorithms', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Ethical Issues', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gold', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Laparoscopic Surgical Procedures', 'Learning', 'Level of Evidence', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Seeds', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Study', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Update', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplasm registry', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'relating to nervous system', 'software systems', 'treatment effect', 'usability', 'user friendly software', 'vector', 'volunteer']",NCI,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R21,2016,178072,29585825,-0.028170421591914276
"Automated Retinal Analysis for Detection of Age Related Macular Degeneration ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study focuses on age-related macular degeneration (AMD) because, left untreated, it is the leading cause of blindness in the adult US population over 50. The goals of this program are twofold. First, the focus is to develop new screening tools to detect individuals with the intermediate stage of AMD, that are otherwise asymptomatic for vision loss, at a stage where they can be referred to a clinician for treatment and follow up, and when vision more likely can be preserved. The second goal is to develop Automated Retinal Image Analysis (ARIA) tools that help characterize Geographic Atrophy (GA), for which novel treatments are being investigated. We are developing data-driven algorithms for AMD screening which leverage recent advances in machine learning and machine intelligence and do not rely on detecting and counting or sizing drusen (a procedure which can be error prone). Instead, our method analyzes a fundus image as a whole using an image classification paradigm, and may also exploit ancillary patient information. Our goal is to use the AREDS dbGaP that includes thousands of images from hundreds of patients and offers a unique opportunity to develop and test these algorithms on a scale that has not previously been possible. Our team consists of the Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute, which will serve as the clinical analysis test site, and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, which will conduct the automated screening software tool analysis, development and testing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goals of this project are twofold. First, in order to work towards improving outcome, our goal is to develop novel software screening tools that allow for the automated detection of individuals with the intermediate stage AMD so that they may be referred to clinicians for follow up and treatment at an earlier stage than would otherwise occur. Second, we will develop new tools to characterize the evolution of GA, for which new treatments are being developed and tested. Our project is a secondary study on the AREDS dbGaP, which will be leveraged for the development and validation of these new algorithms on a scale never before attempted.",Automated Retinal Analysis for Detection of Age Related Macular Degeneration,8998947,R21EY024310,"['Adult', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biotechnology', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Cataract', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Discipline', 'Drusen', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Funding', 'Fundus', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Life', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myopia', 'National Eye Institute', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Pigmentation physiologic function', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'Structure of retinal pigment epithelium', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'age related', 'bioimaging', 'computer program', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'geographic atrophy', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'neovascular', 'novel', 'programs', 'response', 'screening', 'tool']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,180061,807432003,-0.007827539256717265
"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015). He has published in several gastroenterology journals, presented research internationally, and has built the independent collaborations featured in this proposal. Central to this career development award, the candidate will leverage the expertise of several mentors and collaborators to develop deep foundational skillsets in analytic imaging, translational proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods. The University of Michigan houses a nationally recognized Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, internationally recognized proteomics expertise, and a dedicated Analytic Morphomics Group focused on computational image analysis of organs. The mentored research training will be supplemented with focused graduate-level coursework in bioinformatics, medical image analysis, machine learning methodologies, and decision support systems provided through the University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the School of Public Health. The Division of Gastroenterology and Department of Medicine have a history of strong support for Dr. Stidham and will provide the time, resources, and mentorship necessary to achieve his professional and research goals. The training provided through this career development award will be pivotal for the candidate's development as an independent translational investigator focused on individualizing therapeutic management.

PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work evaluates the capabilities of quantitative image analysis and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict the probability of medical response in Crohn's disease.

"Low Cost Mobile Platform for Pulmonary Disease Screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary disease (including primarily asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), pneumonia, lung cancer, and tuberculosis) is an increasingly large portion of the global health burden. Developing countries with large low-income populations are disproportionately affected, due to increased risk factors (e.g. biomass cooking stoves) as well as poor access to health care and lack of affordable screening tools for early detection. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) alone is currently the third leading cause of death in the world and second leading cause of death in India after ischemic heart disease. In the younger population, pneumonia is a particular concern, being the leading cause of death for children under 5 years of age. Tuberculosis (TB) has also reached alarming proportions in India (24% of all cases worldwide). Despite this great prevalence of pulmonary disease in India, access to modern diagnostics instruments is not possible; furthermore, approximately 60% of general practice (GP) clinic doctors in India are primarily trained in Ayurvedic medicine with little or no training for diagnosing respiratory disease. As a result, many of the patients with lung disease are underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed (often confused with cardiovascular disease). As a result, there is a great need to provide health workers in India with simple tools that can be used to diagnose or screen for respiratory disease in the primary care setting. Addressing this need, our team has been developing a mobile diagnostic platform consisting of a digital stethoscope, peak flow meter, and mobile phone that can be used to screen for symptoms of lung disease and provide a guide for diagnosis. The present study extends this work and has the following aims: (1) To validate and test a low-cost mobile diagnostic platform for the purpose of identifying symptoms of lung disease and providing diagnostic guidance. (2) To assess the acceptance and usability of the mobile diagnostic platform by the local general practitioner (GP) doctors in rural India. We propose to deploy and test a low-cost mobile diagnostic platform, making use of machine learning algorithms that will detect specific symptoms of lung disease and help guide diagnosis. In the first year of the project, we shall create and train the mobile software algorithm using data collected in the field from patients (N=250) that have been previously diagnosed with specific lung diseases. Then year 2, we shall evaluate and test our mobile platform with Indian patients (N=250) recruited from four GP clinic sites in the Pune, India region. The automated mobile phone diagnosis result shall then be compared with the diagnosis from trained pulmonologists, using a traditional stethoscope as well as standard lung function testing instruments. A preliminary diagnosis and qualitative feedback shall also be collected from non-trained GP doctors using the mobile tools in order to ascertain usability and diagnostic value.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pulmonary disease is a very large public health concern in India, as well as in most developing countries. Relatively few general practitioner (GP) doctors are trained to properly diagnose pulmonary disease, and affordable tools for diagnostic support simply do not exist. This proposal seeks to validate and test the use of low-cost mobile phone-based diagnostic tools for pulmonary disease.            ",Low Cost Mobile Platform for Pulmonary Disease Screening,9018346,R21TW010245,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Ayurvedic Medicine', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Biomass', 'Bronchitis', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Cookstove', 'Data', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Feedback', 'General Practices', 'General Practitioners', 'Health', 'Household Air Pollution', 'India', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Stethoscopes', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'cost', 'digital', 'global health', 'health care availability', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'meter', 'mobile computing', 'primary care setting', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'tool', 'usability']",FIC,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2016,181365,113554200,-0.019529852335987426
"Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD Project Summary Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. To date, researchers have attempted to use standard machine learning methodology to identify more meaningful subtypes of COPD, but these methods often make general assumptions about the data, limiting their ability to penetrate more complex patterns in some data sets. Thus, a meaningful reclassification of COPD subtypes that could lead to more targeted therapies and interventions has been elusive. The applicant introduces a new way of looking at the COPD subtyping problem by recasting it in terms of discovering associations of individuals to disease trajectories – i.e., grouping individuals based on their similarity in response to environmental and/or disease causing variables. The machine learning methods proposed build on the most recent advances in Bayesian nonparametrics, a collection of theoretical ideas and techniques that permit very flexible data representations. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that these machine learning methods and extensions thereof – together with data sources not previously leveraged for COPD subtyping – will produce more biologically meaningful sub-groupings of patients, leading to a better understanding of the genetic and biological underpinnings of the disease and ultimately improved patient management. Aim 1 of this application involves evaluating the utility of CT-assessed lung mass – a potentially more discriminative measure of emphysema than conventionally used measures – for defining COPD subtypes using both K-means clustering and our disease trajectory algorithm. The goal of Aim 2 is to evaluate the utility of comorbidity data for defining COPD subtypes using our trajectory clustering algorithm. Novel computed tomography based measures of muscle wasting (cachexia) and pulmonary vascular pruning will be explored to determine their efficacy in subtype determination. Additionally, we will extend and test the trajectory algorithm in order to model discrete outputs (such as physician-diagnosed comorbidities), count data (e.g. exacerbations), and time-to-event data (death). In Aim 3, the applicant will extend our trajectory clustering algorithms to directly incorporate genetic and omics data for subtype discovery. Together, the research proposed in the aims of this award will take full advantage of the comprehensive data set available through the COPDGene study. Execution of the aims in this proposal will be possible through active collaboration with Dr. Ron Kikinis, M.D., a renowned leader in the field of medical image analysis, and Dr. Ed Silverman, an internationally recognized expert in the genetic epidemiology of COPD. Project Narrative Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. In carrying out the research outlined in the following proposal, we plan to develop and apply machine learning methods to better identify subpopulations of individuals who have similar forms of COPD, potentially enabling better, targeted therapies.",Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD,9180344,K25HL130637,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cachexia', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Functional Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Mass', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Scheme', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career development', 'cigarette smoking', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'flexibility', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'particle', 'peripheral blood', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K25,2016,188040,327644200,7.549983806625672e-05
"Machine learning with generative mixture models for fetal monitoring DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For many years, there has been a concerted effort to automate the analysis of fetal heart rate (FHR) rhythms. However, despite significant advances in biomedical signal analysis, there has not been any significant improvement in automated decision support systems. FHR monitoring is now ubiquitous throughout delivery rooms, especially using the non-invasive Doppler monitor, but also using the fetal scalp electrode. Physician classification of fetal heart rate patterns is known to be a non-trivial problem because of significant inter and intra-observer variability of diagnosis. This has led to a marked increase in the number of caesarean deliveries, thereby increasing risk to the fetus and mother in many cases. This has further motivated the machine learning community to automate the classification procedure in the interest of accuracy and consistency as well as robustness with respect to noise. Usual approaches to this involve some type of supervised classification procedure, where the algorithm output on training data is compared with a ""gold-standard"" physician classification, followed by testing and validation on new datasets. However, since physician classification can be unreliable in the presence of the aforementioned diagnostic variability, as well as significant tracing noise, we propose the use of unsupervised algorithms to cluster FHR data records into clinically useful categories. We use nonparametric Bayes theory and Markov-time-dependence models for the evolution of feature sequences to propose methods that will achieve improved accuracy. The methods involve extraction of feature sequences from FHR time series data, which are modeled as samples from finite or infinite Dirichlet mixture models. We then use Gibbs sampling to obtain the cluster probabilities for each dataset. Clustering outcomes are compared against direct physician diagnosis and our current results are seen to be in broad agreement with them, while still giving new information on the character of different sub-groups of FHR records. With the proposed research, further gains in classification performance will be made. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Fetal heart rate monitoring is now commonly used during childbirth and, at present, physicians read and interpret these data to classify fetal heart rate patterns and make sure that the baby is not in distress during the course of labor. However, there is great variability in how individual doctors interpret the tracings and this has led increases in the number of caesarean deliveries, thereby potentially increasing risk to both mothers and babies. Thus there has been a concerted effort from the machine learning community to develop an accurate automatic reading and classification procedure so that correct interpretation of fetal heart rates during labor is more diagnostic and consistent.",Machine learning with generative mixture models for fetal monitoring,9018050,R21HD080025,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Apgar Score', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Categories', 'Cesarean section', 'Childbirth', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Delivery Rooms', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Distress', 'Electrodes', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Fetal Heart', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Monitoring', 'Fetus', 'Freedom', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Litigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mothers', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Umbilical cord structure', 'Uncertainty', 'Uterine Contraction', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'fetal', 'heart rate monitor', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning community', 'pressure', 'stem', 'theories', 'vector']",NICHD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R21,2016,193120,77607041,-0.005727130136628298
"Calculation of Percent Body Fat by Analyzing Virtual Body Models ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Excess body fat is a key underlying factor in the development of numerous chronic diseases, including type II diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. The AMA recently declared that obesity, itself, is a disease. Most epidemiologic studies utilize Body Mass Index (BMI) to classify people as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese because it is a convenient and simple method that has been shown to correlate with disease risk. Since the majority of the health risks associated with obesity are more directly linked to an overabundance of body fat than weight, measuring body fat is essential for more precise guidelines. However, accurate methods of assessing body fat are expensive, inconvenient, and require immobile equipment. Consequently, the AMA has called for more cost effective and convenient methods to assess body composition to assist doctors in their assessment and treatment. Virtual modeling of humans in particular has provided ways to scan and analyze the body and its motion. Supervised Machine Learning (SML), a sub-field of artificial intelligence, has made great progress in taking measured data to infer new relationships. It is our belief that virtual modeling and SML can provide the techniques necessary to conveniently and accurately calculate the percentage of body fat (%BF) and to provide new tools in treating obesity based on body shapes. The project will develop a system that uses commercially available depth cameras such as the Microsoft Kinect(r) to capture the surface of the human body. This will be accomplished by developing a new algorithm to perform deformable registration of several RGB-Depth views of the body. A new algorithm that uses SML will be developed to calculate percentage body fat using the surface data. The system will be trained and validated by collecting data from a number of subjects. The surface captured will be used to explore the role of visual body representation in motivation and adherence. The developed systems can be implemented in clinical or personal settings and be utilized as a public health research tool and deployed widely given the low-cost of the hardware required. In addition to the immediate impact that the system will have on managing obesity, the project will have a broad impact on a number of areas. A large database of such shapes captured over time may lead to ways to predict how an individual's body shape will change given a particular intervention. Certain medical conditions that result in body shape change, such as those involving lymphatic circulations, may be diagnosed and tracked more easily. Growth patterns of children may be tracked by change of body shapes. Further research can be conducted to determine the effect of body shape on %BF using data mining techniques. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will develop a new method to capture the 3D surface and shape of a human body and a new method to use these data to calculate percent body fat. By making these tools widely available and economical, the proposed approach has the potential for major contributions in the assessment and treatment of obesity.",Calculation of Percent Body Fat by Analyzing Virtual Body Models,9099872,R21HL124443,"['Adherence', 'Age', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Belief', 'Body Composition', 'Body Size', 'Body Surface', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Equipment', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Imagery', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Muscle', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Plethysmography', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Self Perception', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underweight', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Water', 'Weight', 'Weights and Measures', 'base', 'body density', 'body volume', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'density', 'disorder risk', 'lymphatic circulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'preference', 'public health research', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'study population', 'tool', 'virtual', 'weight loss intervention']",NHLBI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,194340,86807134,0.004848735543330091
"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carolyn Hendrickson, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Hendrickson is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented research of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a focus on the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This K23 award will provide Dr. Hendrickson with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert clinical and translational researcher in ARDS after traumatic injury; (2) to study the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after TBI involving platelet biology, endothelial activation, and lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation; (3) to implement advanced analyses of complex observational data, including machine learning; (4) to develop an independent translational research career. Dr. Hendrickson's plan to achieve these goals is supported by a multidisciplinary mentoring team of experts. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Matthay, has extensive experience in translational ARDS research and in the career development of early stage investigators. Dr. Hendrickson will work with four co-mentors: Dr. Mitchell Cohen, a translational researcher studying coagulation after trauma, Dr. Alan Hubbard, a biostatistician specializing in causal inference, Dr. Geoffrey Manley, a neurosurgeon and leading investigator in TBI research, and Dr. Mark Looney, an expert platelet biology and lung injury. The development of ARDS after TBI is common and is associated with worse neurological outcomes. The biologic mechanisms driving ARDS after TBI are poorly understood. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the risk of ARDS after TBI is mediated through activated vascular endothelium and platelets as well as non-protective mechanical ventilation strategies that use large tidal volumes. Dr. Hendrickson will investigate these causal pathways utilizing previously collected data and plasma from an ongoing observational cohort study. In this same cohort she will prospectively collect biospecimens, detailed mechanical ventilation data, and lung ultrasound images. This proposal represents an innovative approach to studying ARDS after TBI using carefully adjudicated exposures and outcomes. Dr. Hendrickson will test whether plasma biomarkers of endothelial activation, vascular permeability, and inflammation (Aim 1) and platelet function, activation, and aggregation (Aim 2) are associated with ARDS after TBI. She will collect lung ultrasound images and frequent mechanical ventilation data including tidal volumes and plateau pressures. She will test whether early exposure to non-protective mechanical ventilation is associated with ARDS after TBI (Aim 3). Addressing this gap in knowledge may lead to interventions that prevent ARDS and improve outcomes in this patient population. The research and training outlined in this proposal will form the basis for an R01-level proposal designed to study interventions to prevent and treat ARDS after traumatic injury. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because each year in the United States 1.7 million people sustain a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and over 20% of patients with severe isolated TBI develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a form of serious lung disease associated with poor neurological outcomes after TBI. Identification of biologic factors and mechanical ventilation parameters that contribute to ARDS pathogenesis after TBI is the first step in a continuum of research that will pave the way to prevention, personalized risk assessment, improved early management, and targeted treatments for ARDS in patients with TBI. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms of disease in this vulnerable population will expand the understanding of lung injury pathogenesis after a variety of traumatic injuries and perhaps in other high-risk populations.","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation",9164389,K23HL133495,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Angiopoietin-2', 'Animals', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Flow Cytometry', 'Blood Platelets', 'Body Weight', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Endothelium', 'Enrollment', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-8', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mediating', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Platelet Activation', 'Play', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Staging', 'Supportive care', 'TBI Patients', 'TIMP3 gene', 'Testing', 'Thrombelastography', 'Thromboxane B2', 'Tidal Volume', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic injury', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'Vascular Permeabilities', 'Ventilator-induced lung injury', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'lung injury', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient population', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'stem', 'training opportunity']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2016,198612,685608202,0.017364126567690874
"Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The quest for fast image acquisition speed has always been a perennial topic in the MRI community. To reduce the acquisition time for maximal spatial and temporal resolution, modern MRI protocols usually perform reduced acquisitions below the Nyquist rate. The reduced data is then used to reconstruct the image through advanced reconstruction techniques that leverage some prior information about the MRI system (e.g., parallel imaging) and/or MR signal (e.g., compressed sensing). Since such prior information is patient and system specific, recent techniques obtain the prior information using training data obtained through an empirical calibration procedure. All existing methods assume the prior models are linear. Since the intrinsic nonlinear relationship in the training data cannot be characterized in such simple models, the reconstruction is degraded by the inaccuracy of the prior information. Nonlinear learning from the training data have proven to be more powerful in machine learning because it is more general and includes the linear model as a special case. However, it is usually more challenging to learn the nonlinear models and even more challenging to incorporate the model in reconstruction due to the increased degree of freedom. We recently have introduced a novel concept of ""kernel"" in MR reconstruction to address the above challenges timely. Our preliminary results on parallel imaging and sparsity-constrained reconstruction demonstrate that the kernel-based algorithms improve the reconstruction quality over the original algorithms with linear prior models. Built upon our strong preliminary results, the objective of this application is to develop an innovative kernel-based framework for MR image reconstruction from undersampled data. This framework does not require explicit knowledge of nonlinear mapping (as in preliminary work) such that a broader family of nonlinear functions can be explored for different clinical applications. The proposed work is expected to advance the field of MR image reconstruction vertically. Specifically, the successful completion of the proposed project will result in a general framework leading to many new algorithms (including two developed in this project) for reconstruction from reduced acquisition. Therefore, virtually all of current clinical MRI could benefit from the improved resolution, image quality, and/or reduced acquisition times that the new framework will facilitate or the novel applications i may enable. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is to develop a general framework and two specific new techniques to improve the spatial resolution and/or reduce the scan time in magnetic resonance imaging and evaluate the performance of the techniques for 3D parallel imaging and quantitative imaging in brain. The development of such novel fast imaging techniques may greatly enhance diagnosis of neurological disease. Therefore the project will potentially benefit numerous subjects and the healthcare system.",Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling,9119020,R21EB020861,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Family', 'Freedom', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-linear Models', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Polynomial Models', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R21,2016,222652,73424103,-0.001401211456298916
"Aptamer-Based Arrays for Detection of Pathogenic IgA1 O-Glycoforms in IgA Nephropathy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The glycosylation patterns on IgA1 antibodies are highly complex and heterogeneous. When there are dysregulations in activities of glycosylation enzymes, the hinge domain of IgA1's, i.e., the peptide domain connecting constant and variable regions, can undergo shifts in glycosylation patterns and become galactose- deficient (Gd). The galactose deficiency, together with other triggers, can lead to an auto-immune response in which patients' own antibodies form complexes with Gd-IgA1's; these complexes precipitate and cause damage in glomeruli, eventually leading to IgA1 nephropathy (IgAN).  It is of a great interest to monitor regularly Gd-IgA1's of patients who are predisposed to develop nephropathy. Further, increased understanding of correlations between dynamic variations in glycosylation patterns and the natural development of the disease in individual patients is expected to lead to improved interventions, including individually optimized therapies that could block the formation of offending complexes. None of the current approaches to assess microheterogeneity in glycosylation patterns is completely satisfactory; while elegant, these are also arduous and indirect, limited to highly specialized laboratories and difficult to reproduce in actual patients' samples, in large part due to lack of precise, well-characterized, molecular-level analytical tools  We propose to address this issue by systematic isolation of oligonucleotide-based molecular receptors or aptamers that will interact with clusters of different O-glycosides displayed in the hinge subregions. Aptameric receptors will be isolated from large oligonucleotide pools through the process of an in vitro selection and amplification coupled to the affinity separation via interactions with IgA1 hinge regions isolated from both Gd- IgAN patients and healthy controls. Individual aptamers will interact with substructures within the hinge domain, that is, with shorter peptides displaying one or more oligosaccharides. A large number of identified aptamers will be screened for their ability to interact with fractions of polyclonal IgA1's, and a variety of those aptamers that show a quantitatively different response to IgA1s from patients and matched controls will be selected for a more detailed characterization and incorporation in ""classification sensor arrays"" (CSAs).  As the result of our work, we will have immediately a set of aptamers that would together form a classification sensor array, an artificial ""nose"" capable of distinguishing samples belonging to patients with Gd- IgAN from healthy controls, as well as quantifying the extent of shifts in glycosylation patterns. Further molecular-level characterizatio of epitopes (subdomains) that these aptamers recognize is expected to enable studies towards identification of structures that are responsible for auto-immune responses in individual patients, and correlation with secondary triggers of diseases, which are the key step in the rational design of targeted inhibitors of the complex formation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Complex saccharide structures ('glycans') play crucial roles in a wide range of biological functions and diseases such as autoimmunity, cancer, and nephropathy. We will help elucidate the role of complex glycans in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy, one of the most common causes of kidney failure worldwide, by systematically and exhaustively generating oligonucleotide-based receptors (aptamers) for glycan clusters on IgA1 antibodies. This will allow new diagnostic protocols based on pattern recognition with classification arrays and, in the long-term, personalized therapies to prevent antigen-autoantibody interaction and nephropathy.            ",Aptamer-Based Arrays for Detection of Pathogenic IgA1 O-Glycoforms in IgA Nephropathy,9128230,R21DK109690,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Alkaloids', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmunity', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Enzymes', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Galactose', 'Glycosides', 'IgA1', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin Constant Region', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunology', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lectin', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nephrology', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nose', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Sphingosine', 'Steroids', 'Structure', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'aptamer', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder control', 'glycosylation', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'inorganic phosphate', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'screening', 'sensor', 'sugar', 'tool']",NIDDK,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2016,251130,558628098,-0.0078016293172617655
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into the causes, pathogenesis, and natural history of DILI. The ongoing Retrospective study has collected 109 DNA samples from subjects with liver injury attributed to one of 8 drugs. In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and outcomes of drug induced liver injury via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients into the ongoing DILIN Prospective and Retrospective studies. The collection of early blood and urine samples from well-characterized DILI patients will allow for innovative studies of patient, drug and environmental risk factors. Further development of a computerized diagnostic instrument and expansion of the LiverTox website is also planned which will provide doctors, researchers, and the general public an authoritative and up-to-date resource that can help accelerate DILI research in the US and abroad.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013,9132205,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anabolic steroids', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Ancillary Study', 'Assessment tool', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Budesonide', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Expert Opinion', 'Floxacillin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Health', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Herbal supplement', 'Histopathology', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Injury to Liver', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular', 'Monograph', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Valproic Acid', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'chemical property', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'elastography', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'repository', 'screening', 'transcriptomics', 'web site', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2016,268344,641965656,-0.017398465194651654
"Development and Dissemination of MuscleMiner: An Imaging Informatics Tool for Mus DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Image evaluation of skeletal muscle biopsies is a procedure essential to research and clinical practice. Although widely used, several major limitations exist with respect to current muscle image morphometric measurement, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, retrieval, and mining procedures: 1) Although traditional morphometric parameters, such as cross-sectional area (CSA) and minimum Feret diameter, etc., serve as critical indicators for assessing muscle function, current measurements are still largely based on manual or semi-automated methods, leading to significant labor costs with large potential inter-observer variability. 2) The current archiving of muscle images is still mainy based on outdated tools such as Excel spreadsheets and computer file folders. Given a new muscle image, it is almost impossible to quickly cross-compare, visualize, query, search, and retrieve previous cases exhibiting similar image contents with comparable morphometric measures, for the purpose of either discovering novel biological co-correlations at benchside, or providing personalized diagnosis and prognosis at bedside. 3) Although a typical muscle image often contains millions of data points (pixels), in clinical practice, doctors often condense this rich information into one or two diagnostic labels and discard the rest. Novel image markers, which are not always apparent through visual inspections or not manually quantifiable, but potentially represent critical diagnostic and prognostic values for precision medicine, have not been rigorously examined. Similarly, in basic science research, only a very limited number of known measures (e.g., CSA) are considered. Some non-traditional measures, such as myofiber shapes that hold the potential to serve as new indicators of muscle functions, are not fully investigated. 4) Current muscle image analysis and searching functions are fairly low throughput. As a frontier research area, Cloud computing can handle big image data in a distributed manner by providing high-throughput computational power. However, its application to muscle images has never been explored. MuscleMiner will provide a complete suite of tools for automated image morphometric measurements, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, content-based image retrieval, bioinformatics image mining, and Cloud computing. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) Develop the automated morphometric measurement unit, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) unit, and the image archiving and visualization unit. 2) Develop the advanced bioinformatics image mining unit to assist in the rapid discovery and validation of new image markers. 3) Develop the Cloud computing unit to enable big image data processing and searching functions. Disseminate this freely available, Cloud-enabled imaging informatics system to muscle research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose to develop and disseminate an advanced Cloud-enabled imaging informatics tool - MuscleMiner. MuscleMiner will provide a complete suite of tools for automated image morphometric measurements, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, content-based image retrieval, and bioinformatics image mining. The goal of MuscleMiner is to offer a freely available and powerful tool to help all clinician and basic scienc muscle researchers in their daily work. Beyond fast, objective, reproducible, and automated morphometric measurements, the impact of MuscleMiner will be multiplied by laboratories using the CBIR and visualization units (Aim 1), bioinformatics image mining unit (Aim 2), and Cloud-computing unit (Aim 3) to deeply mine and fully utilize the rich information embedded in large collections of muscle images.",Development and Dissemination of MuscleMiner: An Imaging Informatics Tool for Mus,9126405,R01AR065479,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Cells', 'Client', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Fascicle', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mus', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Shapes', 'Slide', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'System', 'Technology', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical practice', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'frontier', 'image archival system', 'image visualization', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized diagnostics', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic value', 'skeletal', 'tool', 'wasting']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2016,316467,188894159,-0.006706519050154674
"3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical assessment of optic nerve swelling is limited by the subjective ophthalmoscopic evaluation by experts in order to diagnose and differentiate the cause of the optic disc edema. The long-term goal of our research effort is to develop automated 3D image-analysis approaches for the identification of an optimal set of 3D parameters to quantify the severity of optic nerve edema over time and to help differentiate the underlying cause. The overall objective in this application is to develop strategies, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve swelling in patients diagnosed with papilledema and to ascertain morphological features that differentiate papilledema from other disorders causing optic nerve edema. The central hypothesis is that information about volumetric and shape parameters obtainable from 3D image analysis techniques will improve the ability to accurately assess the severity and cause of optic disc edema over the existing subjective ophthalmoscopic assessment of optic nerve swelling using the Fris¿n scale or current 2D OCT parameters. The rationale for the proposed research is that having such 3D parameters will dramatically improve the way optic disc swelling is assessed. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1. Develop and evaluate the methodology for computing novel volumetric and shape parameters of a swollen optic nerve head from SD-OCT. This will be completed by refining and evaluating our novel 3D graph-based segmentation algorithms in SD-OCT volumes of patients with optic disc swelling. 2. Identify SD-OCT parameters that optimally correlate with clinical measurements of severity in patients with papilledema and develop a continuous severity scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to relate SD-OCT parameters to expert-defined Fris¿n scale grades (a fundus-based measure of severity). It is anticipated that volumetric 3D parameters will more closely correlate with clinical measures than 2D parameters and will provide a continuous severity scale. 3. Identify SD-OCT parameters that differentiate papilledema from other causes of optic disc swelling (or apparent optic disc swelling, as in pseudopapilledema) and develop a corresponding predictive classifier. Our working hypothesis is that 3D shape parameters, especially those near Bruch's membrane opening, will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach is innovative because the 3D image-analysis methodology developed by the applicants enables novel determination of 3D volumetric and shape parameters and represents a significant improvement over the status quo of using qualitative image information and 2D OCT image information for assessing optic disc swelling. The proposed research is significant because it will help to establish a much-needed alternative and more objective method by which to assess the severity and cause of optic disc swelling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of novel spectral-domain optical coherence tomography parameters for assessing the severity and cause of optic nerve edema is expected to enable more efficient and effective diagnosis and management strategies of patients with such swelling. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to reduce the burdens of disability and is particularly relevant to the part of NEI's mission regarding understanding blinding eye diseases and preserving sight.",3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema,9050682,R01EY023279,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Papilledema', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Swelling', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'digital', 'disability burden', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2016,339750,193405667,0.005702179153097633
"Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Designing an efficient Huntington's disease (HD) early intervention clinical trial for individuals who have an expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene requires identifying and combining clinical, biological, cognitive, and brain imaging markers to accurately distinguish among subjects who will have a diagnosis during a given intervention period and those who will not, and to track early changes in the disease course. The goal of this project is to identify sensitive biomarkers for HD risk stratification, indexing disease progression, and developing clinical trial endpoints. The proposal directly adheres to ""2P's"" of the NIH New Strategic Vision of the ""4P's"" of Medicine: they will offer promising ways to predict when the disease will develop; and increase the capacity to personalize early intervention based on the informative patient-specific markers our models identify. Combining biomarkers to predict HD onset and progression is an essential step in a continuum of research for development of disease-modifying therapies. Composite markers and their risk profiles created from our model will offer quantitative way to monitor and compare potential interventions. Evidence collected from these comparisons will advance the development of efficacy studies in premanifest HD, where neuroprotective treatments would be most beneficial. We develop and apply a series of cutting-edge statistical learning methods based on support vector machine (SVM), variable selection, and dimension reduction to achieve these goals. These modern statistical methods designed for correlated big data have quickly emerged as among the most successful tools for hypothesis generation, classification and prediction in biomedical studies. However, they have not been introduced to HD biomarker research. In aim 1, using counting process, we propose SVM to handle time-to-event outcomes (e.g., time-to-HD-diagnosis) to combine markers into risk scores to discriminate subjects who will experience HD onset in the immediate future from those who will not,  based on their personalized features. Although SVM is well studied for binary outcomes, it is far less explored for time-to-event outcomes. We fill this gap in knowledge. In aim 2, we propose new learning methods for longitudinal outcomes to combine markers that modify the course of HD signs to monitor disease process and distinguish subjects with rapid progression from those with slower progression. In aim 3, we propose to use novel and robust performance measures to compare derived combined markers with existing disease indices and key markers. These aims will fundamentally advance our understanding of markers linked to HD onset and progression. The creation of statistical models for composite markers and risk profiles is especially useful in: (1) offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare potential interventions, and (2) improving power of efficacy studies targeted at premanifest individuals by narrowing the predictive interval which leads to future clinical trials that can be made shorter with fewer subjects. Finally, our improved predictions of HD onset and progression will provide more informative genetic counseling sessions for pre-symptomatic subjects at risk of HD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of Huntington's disease (HD) research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay onset or slow disease progression, and to provide different treatment regimens at each disease stage. To meet this goal, this proposal develops and applies a series of advanced statistical approaches to rank and combine clinical, behavioral, and brain imaging markers to predict HD diagnosis in premanifest subjects during a given time period and to measure disease progression. The creation of model for composite markers and risk profiles is useful in offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare interventions and powering clinical trials for premanifest HD individuals.",Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.,9119862,U01NS082062,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'CAG repeat', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Early intervention trials', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic screening method', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Huntington Disease', 'Huntington gene', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'affection', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'research and development', 'tool']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2016,356244,558628098,-0.022449068828103984
"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning. Success of the project will overcome the major technical hurdles in the use of MRI in radiation therapy and will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information.

"Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The uveitides are a collection of ~30 distinct diseases characterized by intraocular infection. Each disease has its own features, course, treatment, and prognosis. Traditionally, the uveitides have been grouped by the primary anatomic site of inflammation as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. However, there are substantial limitations to this ""lumping"" of diseases. For example, among the posterior uveitides, some (e.g. toxoplasmic retinitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis) are infectious and require treatment with antimicrobial/antiviral agents, some are chronic, presumed immune-mediated diseases that require immunosuppression (e.g. birdshot chorioretinitis, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis), and a few are self-limited, spontaneously-remitting diseases with a good prognosis (e.g. acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome). As such precise diagnosis is critical for research, including epidemiology, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease specific clinical trials. Classification criteria are a type of ""diagnostic"" criteria used for reserch purposes. Although classification criteria seek to optimize sensitivity and specificity, when a trade-off is required, they emphasize specificity in order to ensure that a homogeneous group of patients is being studied. A precise phenotype is required particularly for genomic risk factor studies of complex disorders and translational pathogenesis research, as inclusion of other diseases with different risk factors and disease mechanisms would confound the results. Currently there are no widely-accepted and validated classification criteria for any of the uveitides. Preliminary data indicate ""fair to moderate"" agreement at best on the independent diagnosis of any one case by uveitis experts (κ's 0.27-0.40), but the ability of committees to reach agreement on the diagnosis of >98% of cases. The goal of the ""Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides"" project is for the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group to develop classification criteria for the 25 leading uveitides using a formal, rigorous approach. There are 4 phases to the project: 1) informatics, to develop a standardized terminology; 2) case collection, to develop a preliminary database of ~250 cases of each disease; 3) case selection, to select at least 150-200 cases of each disease that are generally accepted to be the disease (using formal consensus techniques) from the preliminary database into a final database; and 4) data analysis, using machine learning approaches, of the final database to develop a parsimonious set of criteria for each disease that minimizes misclassification. The informatics and case collection phases of the Project are complete. The case selection phase is well underway and uses online voting and consensus conference calls to achieve supermajority acceptance on all cases included in the final database. The goals of this application are to complete case selection and data analysis and develop classification criteria for the 25 of the major uveitides. These results are crucial to future clinical research i the field of uveitis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Collectively, the uveitides are the 5th leading cause of blindness in the U.S., and the cost of treating them is estimated to be similar to that of treating diabetic retinopathy. Because uveitis occurs in all age groups, including children and working-age adults, there is a greater potential for years of vision lost than with age- related diseases. Clinical research in the field of uveitis has been hampered by diagnostic imprecision and a lack of widely-accepted and validated classification criteria, the development of which is the goal of this application; these criteria are needed urgently to advance epidemiology, genomic research, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease-specific clinical trials.            ",Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides,9081760,R01EY026593,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior uveitis', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Choroiditis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intermediate Uveitis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nomenclature', 'Outcomes Research', 'Panuveitis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pigments', 'Population', 'Posterior Uveitis', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Retinitis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Uveitis', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Voting', 'Work', 'age group', 'age related', 'antimicrobial', 'birdshot chorioretinitis', 'cost', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web page', 'working group']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2016,428590,415711940,0.0014226070147043855
"Daily Immune Monitoring in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating condition characterized by profound, chronic fatigue that is not alleviated by rest, as well as pain, post-exertional malaise, and impairments in memory and concentration. ME/CFS affects over one million women in the United States, causing significant distress and loss of function in affected individuals and a significant financial burden on society Because the underlying pathophysiology of ME/CFS is not well-understood, there are no effective treatments developed specifically for the condition, and many patients are unsatisfied with existing treatment options. Previous research provides a strong case for inflammatory involvement in ME/CFS, though no immune factors have been consistently predictive of fatigue across studies. Conventional cross-sectional research approaches may not be sufficiently sensitive for identifying ME/CFS biomarkers in cases of low-level or atypical inflammation. We have observed that women with ME/CFS demonstrate considerable day-to-day variability in their fatigue severity, and this variability may reflect rapid shifts in underlying disease mechanisms. By viewing the daily fatigue variability as an important signal, and collecting blood samples daily, we have identified a small set of serum cytokines that are strongly correlated with changes in ME/CFS 1fatigue. In this proposed study, we plan to confirm our preliminary findings of immune-fatigue relationships in a larger sample. We will collect blood samples for 25 consecutive days in 70 women with ME/CFS, as well as 20 healthy controls and 20 active fatigue controls (individuals with hypothyroidism). Blood samples will be analyzed for 51 different immune factors associated with inflammation. In addition, participants will submit daily reports of fatigue severity on handheld computers. By analyzing fatigue scores and cytokine concentrations longitudinally, we can identify cytokines that ""track"" day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. This approach will allow us to develop a physiological profile that distinguishes high fatigue days from low fatigue days, providing important information about ME/CFS mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will develop a physiological model that uses serum cytokine levels to accurately predict day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. In Aim 2, we will define important ME/CFS subgroups based on cytokine-fatigue relationships. In Aim 3, we will develop a temporal pathway between immune factors and fatigue that identifies early drivers of fatigue. Additionally, we will develop a specimen bank of blood samples that can be made available to other interested researchers. Intensive longitudinal immune monitoring is a unique approach to understanding ME/CFS pathophysiology. Biomarkers revealed by this research will serve as tools in the development of ME/CFS diagnostic tests, and will provide excellent targets for developing improved therapies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a debilitating and poorly understood condition that affects over one million women in the United States. Our goal with this project is to identify biological targets that will allow better treatments for chronic fatigue to e developed. Our unique approach for discovering biomarkers involves monitoring fatigue and immune factor concentrations on a daily basis.

"Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images Abstract Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness among US adults between the ages of 20 and 74 years. Laser photocoagulation surgery has been established as an effective way of treating retinopathy if it is detected early. Yearly retinal screening examinations are a potent tool in the battle to reduce the incidence of blindness from diabetic retinopathy because they provide diabetic patients with timely diagnoses and consequently, the potential for timely treatment. Primary care safety net clinics provide monitoring and other services for diabetic patients but they are often not equipped to provide specialty care services such as retinal screenings. Access to specialists who can provide retinal screenings can be increased through the use of telemedicine, which has shown great promise as a means of screening for diabetic retinopathy in the US and internationally. A pilot study by Charles Drew University investigators had a total of 2,876 teleretinal screenings performed for diabetic retinopathy, with 2,732 unique diabetic patients from six South Los Angeles safety net clinics screened. The present study aims to build on this prior work by: (a) developing novel software that utilizes information from clinical records to detect latent diabetic retinopathy in diabetic patients who have not yet received an annual eye examination, and (b) devising methods to speed up the diabetic retinopathy detection process for diabetic patients who have had digital retinal images taken by partially automating the process using image processing and machine learning techniques. Specifically, we propose to: 1. Develop predictive models for diabetic retinopathy using risk factors collected from patient clinical records. 2. Develop predictive models for automated diabetic retinopathy assessment using a combination of patient  risk factor data and data from digital retinal images previously evaluated by experts. 3. Evaluate the predictive accuracy of: a) the models developed for specific aim 2, and, b) the assessments of  optometrist readers against standard of care dilated retinal examinations by board certified  ophthalmologists for 300 diabetic patients utilizing a new Los Angeles County reading center. 4. Create web-based software tools based on the predictive models developed in specific aim 1 that can be  used to initiate outreach to high-risk patients in under-resourced settings, boosting detection rates for those  patients who are most at risk for diabetic retinopathy. 5. Establish targeted outreach methods to promote screening for patients that the predictive models from  specific aim 1 identify as potentially having undetected diabetic retinopathy. Narrative Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness among US adults between the ages of 20 and 74 years. Although previous studies within the US and internationally have shown that teleretinal screening can increase access to eye examinations for detecting retinopathy, few studies have focused on the US urban safety net, which has ophthalmic screening rates that are well below the US average and a preponderance of diabetic patients who are from ethnic minority groups. Building on a previous teleretinal screening study that assessed 2,732 South Los Angeles patients for retinopathy, this study deploys machine learning and image processing techniques to detect latent retinopathy in unscreened diabetic patients and partially automate the diabetic retinopathy detection process for teleretinal screening.",Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images,9236094,R01LM012309,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alaska Native', 'American Indians', 'Asian Americans', 'Blindness', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'County', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Eye', 'Glucose', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Insurance', 'Hispanics', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Optometrist', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Services', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Telemedicine', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'aged', 'base', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'disorder prevention', 'ethnic minority population', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'inner city', 'laser photocoagulation', 'medical specialties', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outreach', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'racial minority', 'randomized trial', 'safety net', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend']",NLM,CHARLES R.

"Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build and test a dynamic vascular optical tomographic imaging (DVOTI) system that can be used to detect and monitor peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is estimated to affect approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. However, the disease is considerably under-diagnosed, since most patients are asymptomatic and no single reliable screening modality has been established. Most of the undiagnosed and untreated patients are diabetics. They commonly suffer from peripheral neuropathy and hence do not sense and report symptoms (such as pain) that are early signs of the disease. Consequently more than 60% (~65,000 per year) of all lower extremity amputations in the United States are performed in diabetic patients with PAD. With the number of diabetic patients expected to triple and reach almost 100 million by 2050, the problems related to undiagnosed PAD will only rise in the years to come  The most widely used diagnostic test for PAD, determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in conjunction with pulse-volume recordings (PVR), is known to be unreliable for diabetics. And even in non- diabetics, ABI with PVR and all other existing diagnostic tests (such as Duplex Ultrasound or Magnetic resonance angiography), only provides accurate information about proximal occlusions in major arteries of the leg. However, none of these tests assess the distal perfusion of the foot where most complications, such as ulcers and gangrene, typically occur. Monitoring the success of surgical interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, suffers from the same shortcomings, as physicians are limited to the same suite of tests that are inadequate to assess the perfusion of the foot.  Dynamic VOTI promises to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic and monitoring techniques and has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift concerning how vascular diseases are assessed. In preliminary studies we have shown that DVOTI can provide three-dimensional time-series images that provide valuable information about the perfusion of the vascular bed in feet of PAD patients. The near-infrared light used in the instrument has no adverse health effects and measurements can be repeated frequently to monitor post interventional progress. Therefore, we believe that DVOTI will prove to be a safe and accurate method to diagnose and monitor PAD in non-diabetic and diabetic patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build and test a novel optical imaging system that will allow for the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. The disease is considerably under-diagnosed, especially in diabetic patients, the elderly, and patients with kidney disease. The system will address an unmet need to directly assess the degree of blood perfusion in the feet, where most PAD-related complications occur, which lead to over 65,000 amputations each year.",Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease,9116282,R01HL115336,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Angioplasty', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Gangrene', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preventive measure', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ulcer', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'blood perfusion', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'foot', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging system', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'light emission', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optical imaging', 'post intervention', 'prototype', 'screening', 'success', 'theories', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'vascular bed']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2016,553894,558628098,-3.723330983286885e-05
"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will make it possible for a wide community of researchers who collect and analyze medical imaging data to take advantage of a new class of computer algorithms that very accurately label and measure anatomical structures and pathological formations in medical images. By offering more accurate image-derived measurements, the project promises to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, reduce the costs of biomedical re- search studies and pharmaceutical trials, and accelerate scientific discovery.",Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation,9119513,R01EB017255,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'International', 'Intervention Studies', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Myocardium', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aortic valve', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'cardiovascular visualization', 'clinical application', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'multi-atlas segmentation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted imaging', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,597688,593605914,-0.0039083035635572305
"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart transplant (Tx) surgery is a well-established life-saving procedure, but is associated with post- interventional risks such as acute cardiac rejection (ACR) which is one of the leading causes of death in the first year after transplant. Beyond the first year, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the single greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality. Monitoring the patient for post-transplant events is thus paramount. The standard monitoring strategy, however, relies on frequent (12-16 monitoring nodes during year 1 alone) invasive and costly procedures including endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) and catheter angiography. Since EMB and catheter angiography have limited sensitivity due to sampling errors (ACR) or the diffuse nature of the disease (CAV), a reliable non-invasive alternative for the early detection of ACR and CAV would be desirable to reduce the need for invasive procedures, improve sensitivity, and reduce cost. We have recently developed and applied cardiac MRI techniques for the non-invasive assessment of myocardial edema (T2-mapping), diffuse fibrosis (pre- and post-contrast T1-mapping), myocardial velocities (tissue phase mapping), and microvascular quantitative perfusion. We have shown that these techniques can identify distinct regional structural and functional alterations in the heart that correlate with te status of the allograft. Based on these findings, a detailed cost-effective analysis using Markov modeling and decision tree analysis has demonstrated that cardiac MR has tremendous potential to reduce monitoring costs by 40-50% during the first year after Tx alone. This proposal builds on these promising findings and our aim is to develop an new 15-minute structure-function cardiac MRI protocol for the improved detection regional abnormalities associated with ACR (edema, fibrosis, dysfunction) and CAV (perfusion, dysfunction). Integration of MRI with echocardiography and intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) will provide unique multi-modality assessment of the allograft. The application in a longitudinal clinical study coupled with state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis will allow redefining the most effective post-Tx mixed monitoring strategy. The aim is to to help clinicians identify the optimal mixed monitoring strategy, i.e. the optimal combination of multi-modality imaging (structure-function MRI, echo, IVUS) and invasive procedures (EMB, catheter angiography) which provide best outcome (quality adjusted life days) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop a multi-modality imaging protocol for the non-invasive characterization of tissue and function of the left and right heart in patients after heart transplantation. Our aim is to develop a new non- invasive 15 minute diagnostic test in order to provide a previously unattainable quantitative characterization of myocardial structure-function deficits in cardiac transplant patients. The application in a longitudinal clinial study coupled with cost-effectiveness analysis and decision tree modeling will allow to improve current monitoring strategies by combining cardiac MRI, echocardiography, intravascular ultrasound and invasive tests (biopsy, catheter angiography) to provide the best outcome (quality of life days, mortality) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient.",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,9004651,R01HL117888,"['Acute', 'Allografting', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost utility', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling Errors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'base', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'extracellular', 'follow-up', 'heart allograft', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'standard of care', 'two-arm study']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2016,658634,367414121,0.011722462868359476
"High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before a heart attack, and predict risk in millions of patients annually. This is currently limited by the need fo visual interpretation, which is highly variable and depends on the physician's experience. The long-term objective of this program is to improve the interpretation of this widely used heart imaging technique-achieving higher accuracy for disease detection than it is possible by the best attainable visual analysis. This proposal builds on our prior work in conventional myocardial MPS, and focuses on fast, low-radiation MPS imaging (fast-MPS) obtained by new high-efficiency scanners. Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS. The algorithms will include better heart muscle detection by training with correlated anatomical data and a novel approach for mapping the probability of abnormal perfusion for each location of the heart muscle; 2) enhance the diagnosis of heart disease from fast-MPS by machine- learning algorithms that integrate clinical data, stress test parameters, and quantitative image features; 3) demonstrate the clinical utility of the new algorithms applied to automatic canceling of the rest portion of the MPS scan, when not needed. The new system will be more accurate than the clinical expert analysis in the detection of obstructive coronary disease. By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,9064178,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Stress', 'Stress Tests', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,695446,90419233,-0.0077661666671687765
"Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):1 Of all markers of human health, the most intuitive is body shape but based on quantitative evidence.  2 Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio  3 (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality  4 risk than body mass index (BMI). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can quantify regional adiposity in  5 more detail than the above measures but is underutilized for many reasons including potential harm from  6 ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments  7 in the ""quantified self movement"" to better describe phenotypes of body shape and its relation to metabolic  8 risks. The candidate developed in this proposal is 3D optical whole body scanning. If successful, sophisticated  9 obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with 10 disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment 11 technology. Whole body 3D imaging technology is already so accessible that it can be done with video games 12 such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect, and consumer cameras. 13 The long term goal of the Optical Body Shape and Health Assessment Study is 1) to provide phenotype 14 descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in 15 research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive 16 models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, 17 muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat), and then show how our 3DO body composition estimates are 18 associated to important metabolic risk factors. Our central hypothesis is that 3DO measures of body 19 composition with shape classification better predict metabolic risk factors than anthropometry or DXA body 20 composition alone. Our specific aims are: 1. Identify the unique associations of body shape to body 21 composition indices in a population that represents the variance of sex, age, BMI, and ethnicity found 22 in the US population; 2. Describe the precision and accuracy of 3DO scans to monitor change in body 23 composition and metabolic health interventions; and 3. Estimate the level of association of 3DO to 24 common health indicators including metabolic risk factors by gender, race, age, and BMI. In an 25 exploratory aim, we investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct 26 predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class 27 Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self- 28 assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US 29 population, and how these models relate to important metabolic status and body composition. The positive 30 impact will be the immediate applicability to clinicians and individuals for personalized risk assessment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of who is at high risk of metabolic diseases because of a poor metabolic profile. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults. This is relevant to the part of NIH's mission which focuses on the prevention of disease by supporting research in the diagnosis of human diseases.            ",Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment,9082891,R01DK109008,"['Adipose tissue', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Anorexia Nervosa', 'Anthropometry', 'Area', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Composition', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Body measure procedure', 'Classification', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Gender', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Insulin Resistance', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Life Style', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Obesity', 'Obesity associated disease', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Self Assessment', 'Shapes', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Video Games', 'Visceral', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'disorder prevention', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'indexing', 'insulin sensitivity', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'muscle form', 'optical imaging', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'sex', 'subcutaneous', 'tool', 'waist circumference', 'whole body imaging']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2016,706716,685608202,-0.005481957474455327
"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more. This will be accomplished by: optimizing the image processing that is used, further developing new and better image processing methods, and developing a method of ""personalized imaging"", in which, for each individual patient, the minimum amount of imaging agent needed to obtain a good image is computed.",Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging,9061011,R01HL122484,"['4D Imaging', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Protection', 'Radioactive', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical practice', 'computer program', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'predictive modeling', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2016,770494,8894636,0.005546937946612407
"Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disrupted circadian timing has emerged as a serious health and safety issue, yet there are no objective means of easily assessing circadian timing or alignment without performing a highly controlled, multiple-day in- patient study. Altered circadian timing can cause both sleep loss and sleepiness, cause performance errors such as motor vehicle accidents, and impair memory/learning. Thus, despite the obvious need to recognize an individual's circadian phase/alignment, we cannot assess circadian timing clinically or in retrospective studies. Not surprisingly, the first goal of the 2011 NIH Sleep Disorders Research Plan is to identify: ""...metabolic... biomarkers of sleep deficiency and biological timing...and circadian disorders that will facilitate personalized treatments, and clarify the risk associated with untreated sleep and circadian disorders and disturbances."" We are aware that major challenges face biomarker development, including multi-factorial causes of metabolite shifts normally controlled across multiple time-points. Because circadian time is associated with profound metabolic, immune and cardiovascular changes, however, we hypothesize that a biomarker signature for circadian phase derived from -omic markers can be obtained from a single blood sample. We therefore propose to utilize the analytical and bioinformatics platforms and experience in population-level metabolomics studies in the PIs lab to study banked plasma samples from the well-characterized individuals in six tightly controlled circadian rhythm studies run by the four co-investigators.The Aims are:  Aim 1: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and t cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics-  based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples drawn from three constant routine protocols Aim 2: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and to cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples  drawn from four forced desynchrony protocols  Aim 3: To systematically evaluate the validated profiles from Aims 1 and 2 and their mathematical  similarities and differences so as to improve accuracy and precision of the biomarkers  Aim 4: To test the markers identified above under poorly controlled real world applications Identification of biomarker panels will impact multiple aspects of science and health: (i) contribute to clinical recognition and treatment on circadian disorders; (ii) advance personalized medicine through individualized treatment timing to enhance efficacy/reduce side effects of medications (e.g., chemotherapy); (iii) creating epidemiologic tools to relate circadian with disease risk; and aiding development of other disease biomarkers, and; (iv) contribute to research on circadian biology and its implications for human health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to identify blood-based markers that can inform a clinician or researcher about an individual's internal biological clock. At the broad levels of society and public health research, the work has the potential direct benefit of identifying individuals with ""off-set"" clocks (enabling diagnosis and potential therapy), increasing accuracy and precision of studies of blood lipids, facilitating understanding of certain sleep disorders, increasing understanding of the role of biological clocks in chronic disease processes (e.g., cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease), and potentially improving the administration of certain pharmaceuticals, eg, chemotherapy agents.        ","Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting",9083622,R01HL132556,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Clocks', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Disease', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Memory', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Strigiformes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker panel', 'blood lipid', 'blood-based biomarker', 'chemotherapy', 'combinatorial', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'human population study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'meetings', 'men', 'metabolomics', 'older women', 'personalized medicine', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'real world application', 'tool', 'vehicular accident']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2016,848973,327644200,-0.0029128369126422593
"Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Application ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this Phase IIB application, we propose to commercialize and bring to market EyeArt, a fully automated, high throughput, retinal image analysis based diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening tool (which has been developed and already validated in bench tests on very large real-world data) by conducting formal clinical trials and integrating it into several clinical information systems. With its fully automated use, high throughput capability (can analyze several thousands of patient cases in just a few hours), scalable architecture, and ability to seamlessly integrate into clinical workflows, EyeArt will aid the expansion of DR screening and help bridge the exponentially growing disparity between the number of diabetic patients and the number of eye care providers. DR is a common microvascular complication of diabetes affecting 80% of all diabetic patients. Even though vision loss due to DR is preventable by early detection and treatment, it is the one of the leading global causes of preventable blindness primarily due to the lack of easy access to eye care providers. Automated DR screening is the only way to make DR screening more accessible to the large and growing population of diabetic patients, currently 29 million in the US and 387 million world-wide and expected to grow to 110 million and 592 million respectively by 2030.  To help reduce risk of DR vision loss in the diabetic population, EyeArt uses advanced image analysis algorithms to make DR screening more efficient, cost-effective, and more accessible. EyeArt has been validated and shown to have high screening sensitivity (safety) and efficacy on multiple large real-world datasets including one with over 54,000 patient cases (and 434,000 images) obtained from EyePACS, a DR telescreening system with over 360 sites in the US and elsewhere. Eyenuk has received ISO 13485 certification as a medical device manufacturer and EyeArt has received CE Marking and is commercially available in Europe. Going forward, we will clinically validate EyeArt in formal clinical trials and integrate it into clinical informatio systems to enable EyeArt's seamless incorporation into existing clinical workflows. This will pave the way for EyeArt's availability to the US DR screening market and reduce the burden on clinical resources by improving health care productivity. This will help increase the DR screening conformance in the diabetic population and thus help in reducing and ultimately eliminating vision loss due to DR through early detection and treatment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: EyeArt, a fully automated, high throughput, retinal image analysis based diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening system will help in screening patients in need of expert care thus making DR screening more efficient, cost- effective, and accessible. EyeArt's integration into EyePACS, a DR telescreening system, will facilitate an expansion of DR screening within the large and expanding EyePACs network of primary care centers in the US and elsewhere. We are also collaborating with Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LAC-DHS) which already uses the EyePACS to deploy our system following clinical validation, in their under-resourced safety net teleretinal screening setup which caters to large disparity populations of LA County. The increased access to DR screening will help reduce and ultimately eliminate vision loss due to DR through early detection and treatment.            ",Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Application,9142236,R44EY026864,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Background Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Blindness', 'Caliber', 'Caring', 'Certification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consult', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Angiopathies', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Europe', 'European', 'Exudate', 'Eye', 'Faculty', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Industry', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Italy', 'Lesion', 'Los Angeles', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Marketing', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medicine', 'Observational Study', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retinal', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specificity', 'Surrogate Markers', 'System', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical care', 'cloud based', 'computerized', 'cost effective', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'high throughput analysis', 'image processing', 'improved', 'macular edema', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'safety net', 'screening', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool']",NEI,"EYENUK, INC.",R44,2016,984026,1300000,0.008066537868734307
"Development of real-time, automated 3D ultrasound tools for the study of placental invasion and morphology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Among the most intractable pregnancy pathologies are those related to aberrant trophoblast invasion and the subsequent remodeling of maternal vasculature at the utero-placental interface (UPI). These include preeclampsia (PE), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and abnormally invasive placenta (AIP, aka placenta accreta). Despite this, tools to measure placental structure and function in the crucial late first to early second trimester period have yet to be developed that can be translated from the research environment to routine clinical use. We are now constructing 3D power Doppler ultrasound technologies that provide real-time, quantitative assessment of placental structural and vascular development. We have developed novel semi- automated methods for calculation of placental volume (PlaV) and new methods to measure gross placental morphology (GPM; dimensions, surface area etc.) and to assess the vasculature at the UPI (Fractional Moving Blood Volume, FMBV). We propose four Aims intended to move the field towards routine imaging of placental structure and function in real time and to generate clinically useful tests for monitoring significant placental pathologies. In Aim 1, using machine learning techniques and an extant database of ~2800 1st trimester placental scans, we will fully automate the novel tools developed for measurement of PlaV into a real-time analytical package. Aim 2 will focus on 3D ultrasound techniques to interrogate the vasculature at the UPI through refinement of our new method for determining FMBV, a quantitative measure of vascularity. This will lead to a tool that can assess the entire UPI, a major site of pathology in PE, IUGR and AIP. We also aim to develop 3D power Doppler ultrasound tools for the examination of the size and distribution of the spiral artery jets feeding the intervillous space, enabling us to explore normal and pathological development of the intervillous supply in real-time. Aims 3 and 4 are prospective validation studies designed to test the utility of the tools described above. Aim 3 extends our recently published study of over-invasion of the maternal vasculature to the 1 /2 trimester. The presence and severity of AIP is assessed using Acon, the largest area of standard 3D power Doppler signal at the UPI. Under-invasion will be addressed via analysis of prospectively collected 11-13 week 3D-PD scans in women who develop PE. We will compare PlaV, GPM, FMBV and spiral artery jets in normotensive and preeclamptic pregnancies. The prospective study in Aim 4 will address the environmental impact of smoking by comparing structural and vascular parameters between smokers and non-smokers at weekly intervals from 8-18 wks. These powerful longitudinal studies will map the development of morphologic and vascular features in smokers and non-smokers and provide new insights into the factors responsible for smoking-induced growth restriction. The strong investigative team, composed of bioengineers, maternal-fetal medicine specialists and placental biologists, is delivering these new tools in the research setting and is poised to generate new methods for clinical measurement of placental structure and vascular function in real-time.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If the placenta does not develop normally, complications like poor fetal growth and preeclampsia in the mother occur. We are developing new ultrasound techniques to measure the placenta early in pregnancy. This could permit early detection of problems that occur months later in the pregnancy. This would allow doctors to monitor the pregnancy and to prevent or treat problems quickly, before they have serious effects on the fetus.        ","Development of real-time, automated 3D ultrasound tools for the study of placental invasion and morphology",9076751,U01HD087209,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood Volume', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decidua', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Doppler Ultrasound', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Environmental Impact', 'Fetal Growth', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetus', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Mothers', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Accreta', 'Placentation', 'Plant Roots', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Scanning', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Specialist', 'Spiral Artery of the Endometrium', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Vascularization', 'Woman', 'feeding', 'fetal', 'fetal medicine', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'insight', 'model development', 'myometrium', 'non-smoker', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'tool', 'trophoblast', 'validation studies']",NICHD,HACKENSACK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2015,45454,20704924,0.0001585260365613261
"QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tissue identification and quantification plays a significant role in the study of aging and age-related diseases. For example, the accumulation of fat in the human body and its regional distribution with aging is associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Changes in muscle composition are strongly linked to decline of muscle strength, decreased mobility caused by aging, or musculoskeletal disorders. Especially interesting is analysis of longitudinal changes of morphometric descriptors that is significant for studying the aging process and for the diagnosis and prevention of age-related diseases.  Medical imaging has emerged as a major tool for estimation of body composition mainly due to being non- invasive and producing multi-dimensional information. Nowadays MRI and CT acquisition is a central component of clinical trials. An abundance of imaging data is collected, but this wealth of information has not been utilized to full extent. Therefore research on image analysis techniques for tissue quantification that are reproducible and can be used on large-scale clinical trials is of particular importance.  The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse body composition data from modern MRI and CT imaging. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that qualitative body composition phenotypes on clinical imaging will differentiate individuals who are healthy versus those who are not. The goal of our work is to provide a foundation for image analysis of the abdomen and lower extremities and to study the relationship between body morphological changes and age-related pathologies.  We will build upon recent advances in medical image computing to segment muscle, regional adipose tissue, and bone in clinical CT and MRI scans. We will also develop image registration procedures to achieve intra- and inter-subject correspondence and make efficient use of information provided by multi-modal and multi-temporal imaging data collected in clinical trials (aim 1). After these methods have been developed, we will address the hypothesis that quantitative use of clinical imaging can increase the prognostic accuracy of age-related pathologies (aim2).          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age-related diseases such as type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and sarcopenia have become a worldwide epidemic and affect the quality of life of millions. To give a global perspective, roughly 343.8 million people in the world have type-2 diabetes today, and 175 million don't know they have diabetes at all. Metabolic diseases are strongly linked to longitudinal changes in body composition, morphology and function. This project will contribute novel and non-invasive medical image analysis techniques for studying the human body composition and its changes with increasing age to achieve timely prognosis of these pathologies.                 ",QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES,8854343,SC3GM113754,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delaware', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Role', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Techniques', 'Thigh structure', 'Tissues', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age related', 'biophysical model', 'bone', 'effective therapy', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'morphometry', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'sarcopenia', 'statistics', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY,SC3,2015,63363,4139254,0.007253671986119038
"Prediction of IPF Progression Using Imaging Patterns ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of unknown etiology occurring in older adults. IPF is ultimately fatal with a median survival of 2 to 5 years, and exhibits a highly heterogeneous natural history. Broad categories of disease progression have been defined, but are not predictable at the time of diagnosis. These designations of natural history assume great importance at a time when insights from preclinical studies are beginning to translate into therapies targeted at specific key pathways of fibrosis. Stratification of disease phenotypes is important in order to decipher the effects of newly approved therapies among individuals with biologically dissimilar natural histories and to better tailor therapy to individual patients.  Various prognostic tools have been developed for IPF that correlate with overall survival; most use clinical and functional variables independent of imaging findings. Prognostic determinants based on imaging features rely largely on subjective visual assessment of disease. In contrast, no good early predictive models exist that anticipate the natural history of disease in advance of significant functional decline. Given the indispensable role of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in the diagnosis and surveillance of IPF, we propose to mine the rich information in HRCT data sets to develop robust, quantitative features that can anticipate disease progression in advance of debilitating respiratory compromise. We propose to use the anonymized clinical data and source images on 234 patients with IPF from multicenter trials, and whose data are archived at the UCLA Computer Vision and Imaging Biomarkers Laboratory. Using an image processing pipeline developed in our laboratory for quantitative image analysis, we will train a classifier on scans annotated manually by an expert radiologist, analyzing in separate aims static image features present on baseline scans and transitional (difference) morphologic features on sequential scans that herald progressive disease. Features of anatomic distribution will be explored and reproducible imaging features will be expressed with a quantitative lung fibrosis (QLF) score. Aggregate prognostic models using Cox proportional regression models will be derived using only clinical covariates and combined clinical and imaging covariates, correlating these models with progression free survival. Finally, we will externally validate our models in an independent institutional registry of clinical and image data on patients with IPF seen in the UCLA Interstitia Lung Disease Program.  Our objectives are centered on the goals of using preexisting datasets to develop clinically meaningful models that anticipate disease course in patients with IPF. We anticipate that these models can be used clinically at the individual patient level to enable more informed and timely management decisions for the choice in treatment as well as future research to define more homogeneous cohorts for testing new safe and effective therapies and to better elucidate the effects of therapies in patients with biologically heterogeneous disease progression.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of older adults that now has a few treatment options: The natural history of IPF and its rates of progression are highly variable, which hampers timely decisions about referral for lung transplantation or treatments using newer drug therapies. This research takes advantage of clinical and imaging datasets previously collected for research or clinical purposes, and will define image features using computer analysis of computed tomography (CT) images to predict disease course in advance of respiratory deterioration. The success of this research will enable us to distinguish between patients with slowly versus rapidly progressive disease, leading to more timely management decisions, and may help us to understand which patients might benefit from novel promising therapies or treatments and which may not.            ",Prediction of IPF Progression Using Imaging Patterns,8956609,R21HL123477,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Biopsy', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Derivation procedure', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hamman-Rich syndrome', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lung', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Natural History', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Progressive Disease', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Stable Disease', 'Stratification', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'digital imaging', 'disease classification', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'effective therapy', 'functional decline', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'insight', 'interstitial', 'novel', 'preclinical study', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pulmonary function', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'respiratory', 'success', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2015,107290,673201228,-0.006825465884250124
"Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 award will support my development as an independent investigator with a translational research program that specializes in the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Candidate: My research experience as a cognitive neuroscientist ideally positions me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise on the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative disease. I have strong cognitive training with an M.Sc in Psycholinguistics and Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where I was supported by an NRSA Individual Predoctoral Award. During my postdoctoral IGERT fellowship at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I was awarded an NRSA Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship Award to investigate the role of decision-making in language. In this research I have gained experience investigating neurodegenerative disease patients comparatively in order to obtain converging evidence to complement fMRI studies of healthy adults. I have become increasingly interested in translating my research to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. I was recently award the Society for the Neurobiology of Language Postdoctoral Merit Award in recognition of my novel research investigating how social limitations in patients contribute to difficulty in discourse. I have committed to four years of clinical research the NIH Loan Repayment Program, and I intend to commit to clinical research for the duration of my career. I have learned that cognitive and neuroimaging studies provide only one perspective on neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal, I plan to gain the necessary expertise in biological aspects of FTLD and related conditions to complement my past experiences, and thus achieve my goal of becoming a multifaceted independent investigator with expertise in the cognitive and biological basis for neurodegenerative diseases. With the support of this K01, I will develop expertise to conduct investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, and neuropathological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. I will ultimately integrate the biological expertise gained in this proposal with language studies from my cognitive neuroscience research in an effort to identify non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to screen patients for clinical trials and to measure the efficacy of disease-modifying agents. Environment: This award will be conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Neurology, the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR), and the Penn Bioinformatics Center where I have strong institutional support. The proposed institution is an exceptional environment that has expert centers for neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, a leading genetic research core, expert neuropathology, outstanding biostatisical support, and relevant clinical research laboratories. The University of Pennsylvania is unique in comparison to other institutions in the country because all of the above methods are available in one center. My mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentor, Dr. John Trojanowksi, have international reputations for neurodegenerative disease research. My career development will also be supported by my co-mentor, Dr. Lyle Ungar, who has extensive expertise in statistical learning algorithms and in the analysis of proteomic and genomics datasets. Together, this mentorship team will facilitate my development as an independent investigator by providing access to existing and future collaborators, laboratory resources, and exceptional training environments. The CNDR is a world- leading center for neurodegenerative disease research with human and animal models of disease and exceptional translational science. Biofluid biomarker experience is extensive, and several national biofluid cores are centered at Penn (e.g. ADNI). There is a wealth of internationally-recognized neuroimaging expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Imaging and Computer Science Laboratory, and I will benefit by integrating neuroimaging resources from these facilities with other modalities of biomarker research. Training: I will develop my expertise in the biological basis of neurodegenerative disease with the support of my mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentors, Dr. John Trojanowski and Dr. Lyle Ungar. Specifically, with Dr. Trojanowksi I will engage in training related to biofluid and genetic biomarkers of FTLD. I will develop advanced neuroimaging skills and cutting-edge biostatistical methods with Dr. Ungar. Each of these training modalities will be supported by complementary formal coursework, participation in seminars, attendance of conferences, and regularly scheduled meetings with mentorship team. Research: FTLD is a neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 15 out of 100,000 individuals. In recent years detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have demonstrated distinct sources of histopathological abnormalities in FTLD, including the presence of tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). However, there are currently no in vivo methods for discriminating between FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. There is an urgent need to improve the in vivo diagnosis of FTLD to appropriately enter patients into emerging clinical trials, and to develop sensitive and specific endpoints in trials that can quantify response to these treatments. The overall research aim of this proposal is to develop multimodal methods to improve in vivo diagnosis of FTLD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) affects approximately 15 out of 100,000 adults. Detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have identified two distinct sources of histopathological changes that contribute to FTLD. However, there are currently no in vivo methods for diagnosing pathological subtypes of FTLD. There is an urgent need to identify in vivo diagnosis methods to facilitate the identification of appropriate patients to enter into emerging disease-modifying drug treatment trials.

"Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career transition award will provide the applicant with protected research time to develop an independent research career in biomedical informatics. Dr. Starkey received his M.D. in 2003 from UT Southwestern, completed the NLM Biomedical Informatics Training Program post-doctoral fellowship in 2011 and earned a Ph.D. focusing on clinical informatics from the Clinical Sciences Degree Program at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston in 2012. Dr. Starkey accepted a faculty position at the Institute for Translational Sciences at UTMB that is currently supporting his transition to independent investigator. Dr. Starkey will utilize the career transition award for novel applications of advanced machine learning methods to create predictive models of disease. Predictive models of disease allow for the stratification of risk and prevention of disease and have been successfully implemented in the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. Predictive models of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are an active area of research since CKD is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and end-stage renal disease. However, there is not a single predictive model of CKD created for application to Hispanics and the external validity of existing models is poor. The objective of this project is to create predictive models of chronic kidney disease in a Hispanic population and quantify biomarkers of chronic kidney disease using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomics in this minority population. MRM proteomics will utilize the UTMB Novel Methodologies core and its array of resources to create an inter-institutional collaboration. Heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods will be used to create the predictive model of chronic kidney disease in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC). Established in 2004, the CCHC is a random population sample in Brownsville, Texas created to evaluate the determinants of health in a US/Mexico border population that is primarily of Hispanic ethnicity. The CCHC has an extremely high prevalence of obesity and diabetes at 49.7% and 30.3%, respectively. Both obesity and diabetes are independent risk factors for the development of CKD and represent significant health disparities in the Hispanic population. Archived serum samples of CCHC participants and the CCHC database will be utilized to complete the following aims: 1) Create predictive models of CKD in a Hispanic population 2) Refine the predictive models by including clinical laboratory data and a selective reaction monitoring mass spectrometry panel of biomarkers. At the completion of this project, predictive models of CKD applicable to a Hispanic population will be created and MRM proteomics will demonstrate utility of biomarkers identified in other populations. The application of the results will be used to create clinical tools for CKD risk and guide future studies in this Hispanic population with health disparities. Importantly, it will provide a career transition for D. Starkey to demonstrate the knowledge gained during his training that results in impactful research and publications. PROJECT NARRATIVE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because it allows stratification of chronic kidney disease risk and quantifies biomarkers of chronic kidney disease in the Hispanic minority whom has significant health disparities with regard to kidney disease. The translation of selective reaction monitoring of biomarkers and development of heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods for application to the prediction of chronic kidney disease in a minority population supports the NLM mission.",Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population,8929292,K22LM011869,"['Age', 'Albumins', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Career Transition Award', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'County', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Household', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specimen', 'Stratification', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Work', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'innovation', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'multiple reaction monitoring', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool', 'urinary']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K22,2015,132348,98796731,-0.0009514724677320882
"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes. Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection,8875578,K23AI097225,"['Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Area', 'Aspergillosis', 'Aspergillus', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breath Tests', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Dolin', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Exhalation', 'Fingerprint', 'Fusarium', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Mucorales', 'Mucormycosis', 'Mycoses', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scedosporium', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Glutamate', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Spectrometry', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The science of Mycology', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vial device', 'Woman', 'Work', 'air sampling', 'base', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cooking', 'data mining', 'diagnostic assay', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2015,137160,327644200,0.0007737479008024604
"Instrument to Co-register EEG and NIRS for Accurate Sleep Sorting DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     PROJECT SUMMARY Sleep disorders are highly prevalent and are associated with substantial adverse consequences including motor vehicle and other accidents, impaired cognition, impaired immune function, altered mood, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality. The gold standard test for assessing the physiology of sleep is the polysomnogram suffers from a number of well-recognized limitations. These limitations decrease the capacity of sleep researchers to make advances in understanding sleep and diminish the capacity of clinicians to detect and treat patients suffering from sleep disorders. (PSG). Currently employed PSG technology Our long-term goal is to address the shortcomings of current PSG methodology by developing a low cost, low for automated assessment of sleep physiology. We hypothesize that this would be possible by expanding the types of brain assessments carried out to include near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) where recent evidence suggests that the low frequency hemodynamic oscillation reflect sleep stage-related changes in brain function. NIRS also simultaneously provides cerebral oxygen saturation, heart rate and breathing rate estimates. In this application, we propose to design, build, and test power, low noise, ultra-miniaturized, wireless system a proof-of-principle prototype system combining diffuse optical spectroscopic, electrophysiological, and inertial . This system will have the form factor of an adhesive bandage which will disturb and limit subjects to a far lesser degree than traditional PSG systems. We will use supervised machine learning-based methods to explore NIRS features specific to sleep stages and clinically relevant events. Other innovations include recording inertial signals and incorporating adaptive signal processing in order to remove artifacts and improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR), and using commercial-off-the-shelf proximity sensor circuitry to support the NIRS front-end. measurement capabilities If successful, this project will lead to improved capacity to carry out sleep research and to detect and treat sleep disorders. The proposed methodology would test whether novel clinically relevant NIRS parameters can be explored enabling further understanding of sleep physiology. The miniaturization, low cost, and low power consumption of our new NIRS-based wireless system would pave the way for rapid adoption and deployment of these bandages for home-use in real-world settings. Given the high prevalence and substantial impairments associated with sleep disorders, this project has the potential to have a major positive impact on public health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Project Narrative A review carried out by the Institute of Medicine concluded that 50-70 million people in the United States suffer from a chronic disorder of sleep and wakefulness which diminishes their ability to function, adversely impacts their health, and decreases longevity. Current systems for objectively monitoring sleep physiology and diagnosing sleep disorders suffer from a number of widely-recognized shortcomings that limit the capacity of researchers to make advances in understanding sleep and sleep disorders and diminish the capacity of clinicians to detect and treat patients suffering from these conditions. Our long term goal is to develop a low cost, low power, low noise, ultra-miniaturized, wireless system for automated assessment of sleep physiology which addresses these shortcomings. The specific objective of this proposal is to investigate the capability of a miniaturized, wireless near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) system to achieve this. As such, the proposed project has the potential to improve the lives of the millions of people suffering from sleep disorders.",Instrument to Co-register EEG and NIRS for Accurate Sleep Sorting,8930756,R21NS085818,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Adhesives', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Apnea', 'Bandage', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Breathing', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Event', 'Fingers', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Head Movements', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'High Prevalence', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lithium', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Movement', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Noise', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Optics', 'Oxygen', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Plethysmography', 'Polymers', 'Polysomnography', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scalp structure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep Stages', 'Sleeplessness', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Wakefulness', 'Weight', 'Wireless Technology', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'immune function', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'meetings', 'miniaturize', 'mortality', 'novel', 'prototype', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'sleep onset']",NINDS,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R21,2015,148458,32532200,-0.01310236426515365
"HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research DESCRIPTION:   My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator who harnesses biomedical Big Data Science for the investigation of multilevel influences on health. To continue my progress towards this goal, I am proposing to build the infrastructure to establish a neighborhood data repository, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers and policy makers. I am a highly trained researcher in social epidemiology and quantitative analyses, particularly large health surveys. Before coming to Utah, I worked as a full-time statistical programmer/data analyst on a NIH-funded project to evaluate the health effects of a large neighborhood relocation policy experiment on low-income families in five cities. Our study results suggested that moving from high- to lower poverty neighborhood is related to reductions in obesity and diabetes and improved mental health. Other extant research has provided evidence on associations between the neighborhood environment and mortality and morbidity-even after adjusting for individual characteristics. Poor access to healthy food, fast food chains, the lack of recreational facilities, and higher crime rates all correlate with hiher obesity rates. Nonetheless, the dearth of neighborhood data, especially measures of neighborhood quality that are consistent across geographic areas, limits neighborhood effects research. Moreover, neighborhoods are not only defined by their resources, but also by the social interactions and activities of people who live there. The widespread usage of the internet and open recording of many transactions has led to the availability of massive amounts of data that permits capture of previously hidden micro-level interactions. We will build the data algorithms and infrastructure to harness relatively untapped, cost efficient, and pervasive social media data to develop neighborhood indicators such as food themes, healthiness of food mentions, frequency of exercise/recreation mentions, metabolic intensity of physical activities, and happiness levels. The creation of HashtagHealth requires the use and refinement of Big Data methods to perform data mining, processing and storing of heterogeneous, unstructured data. We will build a testable version of HashtagHealth for the state of Utah and then apply the data resource to the examination of neighborhood effects on young adult obesity. My rigorous training and previous research experiences in social determinants of health, causal inference, and data analyses uniquely prepare me to make significant contributions to the field of Big Data, particularly at the intersection of public health and social sciences.  My Specific Aims are: 1) to develop a neighborhood data resource, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers, 2) to develop Big Data techniques to produce novel neighborhood quality indicators (e.g., healthiness of food mentions, frequency and type of exercise/recreation and happiness levels), and 3) to utilize HashtagHealth and individual-level data from the Utah Population Database to investigate neighborhood influences on obesity among young adults. My mentorship team includes experts in biomedical research (Drs. Ken Smith, Jim VanDerslice), computer science (Dr. Feifei Li), and statistics (Dr. Ming Wen). My team has the breadth of expertise to help me obtain critical multidisciplinary skills and successfully implement my research aims. In addition to my research aims, my Specific Career Development Aims include the following: 1) to develop expertise in data mining and database systems, 2) to acquire training in natural language processing and machine learning, 3) to further gain knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), 4) to develop expertise in study design and analysis of neighborhood effects, and 5) and to develop grant writing and research management skills to lead future projects. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to successfully compete for R01 funding to create a national neighborhood data repository and to investigate national patterns of neighborhood effects on obesity. This proposal makes significant, relevant contributions to the field because 1) neighborhood environments are increasingly linked to important health outcomes, and 2) this project addresses the limits to research resulting from the lack of neighborhood data by providing new, cost-efficient data resources and methods for characterizing neighborhoods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic rise in obesity and related chronic diseases in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. My overarching career goal is to contribute to the improvement of population health by conducting research in social determinants of health and developing new methodologies to address multidimensional research questions. The development of the Hashtag Health data repository will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of social media data to capture social and cultural processes with potential impact on health.",HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research,8935814,K01ES025433,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Communications Media', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Food Chain', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Database', 'Poverty', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'built environment', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'fast food', 'food consumption', 'health data', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'news', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'research study', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'young adult']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2015,155674,228951281,-0.004051781545304218
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,8849802,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'human CCL26 protein', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2015,156324,507546965,-0.021467823945147596
"Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During medical imaging, patient motion is virtually unavoidable presenting a significant source of image degradation and artifacts, which in turn, can impact the quality of care received by many patients. One method used to address patient motion is to employ visual tracking systems (VTS), which involves placing a small number of reflective markers on the patient that can be located and tracked in 3D space using stereo cameras. The tracked markers can then be used as a surrogate to a structure of interest, such as the heart. The tracked surrogate provides a quantifiable measure that can be directly correlated with the motion of the target structure, which can then be used for prospective or retrospective motion correction. However, the markers add complexity to patient workflow, provide only a sparse sampling of the patient's surface, and the optimal number and placement of markers is unknown. This project addresses the shortcomings of marker-based VTS systems by proposing to develop and test a novel low-cost marker-less VTS system for tracking patient motion within a hybrid imaging system. The primary barrier for successfully tracking the patient's body surface using marker-less VTS is that clothing prevents an unobstructed view of the patient's body. The candidate, Dr. Lindsay, is proposing to incorporate a translational method using computational approaches to compensate for garments within the proposed marker-less VTS system. Dr. Lindsay has received training in computer science and computer vision and previously has focused on the computational aspects of capturing, modeling, and rendering of physical phenomena such as light and is proposing to extend this knowledge to the medical imaging field. Dr. Lindsay's goals for this proposal are to acquire the necessary training and skills that will allow him to translate his expertise and existing computational skills to an area f research with medical relevance: namely, detecting and tracking patient motion for the purpose of improving motion correction for hybrid- imaging. Dr. Lindsay's long-term career goal is to become an accomplished independent investigator focusing on solving significant problems in medical imaging by translating advances in Computer Science. The proposed work will take place the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (UMass) in Worcester, MA under the primary mentorship of Dr. Michael King, an internationally known expert in the area of medical imaging and medical physics in Nuclear Medicine. Drs. Gennert, Sullivan, Licho have expertise in computer vision, mechanical engineering and medical imaging, and radiology and Nuclear Medicine, respectively will also serve as co-mentors.  The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) develop a novel marker-less VTS, which we call PT- Cam, using low-cost using state-of-the-art camera technology, 2) model surface motion as a surrogate for internal motion of the heart, and 3) conduct tests of the PT-Cam system, in order to determine the acceptability and feasibility of clinical usage, on patients undergoing clinical MPI PET/CT imaging. Thus, the main objective of this program of research is to develop a clinically viable method for motion tracking patients undergoing hybrid-imaging studies by using a novel marker-less surface-tracking method that can compensate for clothing and provide modeling of interior motion of structures from surface tracking. If successful, not only will this project provide an innovative, marker-less VTS system for low-cost surface tracking for motion compensation during hybrid imaging but it will also give the candidate the necessary training needed to become an independent investigator in the medical field and potentially a leader in the field of medical imaging.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 7.2 million people per year die world-wide from coronary artery disease (CAD), and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become a critical tool for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment of CAD. During medical imaging such as MPI, patient motion is virtually unavoidable and presents a significant source of image degradation and it has been suggested that upwards of 40% of cardiac studies in PET are effected by some type of motion with similar findings for SPECT. The proposed project will directly address the shortcomings of previous methods for tracking patient motion by developing and testing a novel low-cost marker-less visual tracking system for patient motion within hybrid imaging.                ",Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging,8968015,K25EB019032,"['Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Body Surface', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clothing', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marketing', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Optics', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Security', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'heart motion', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'skills', 'skills training', 'success', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'visual tracking', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K25,2015,169609,294146927,0.007073570161482853
"Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The quest for fast image acquisition speed has always been a perennial topic in the MRI community. To reduce the acquisition time for maximal spatial and temporal resolution, modern MRI protocols usually perform reduced acquisitions below the Nyquist rate. The reduced data is then used to reconstruct the image through advanced reconstruction techniques that leverage some prior information about the MRI system (e.g., parallel imaging) and/or MR signal (e.g., compressed sensing). Since such prior information is patient and system specific, recent techniques obtain the prior information using training data obtained through an empirical calibration procedure. All existing methods assume the prior models are linear. Since the intrinsic nonlinear relationship in the training data cannot be characterized in such simple models, the reconstruction is degraded by the inaccuracy of the prior information. Nonlinear learning from the training data have proven to be more powerful in machine learning because it is more general and includes the linear model as a special case. However, it is usually more challenging to learn the nonlinear models and even more challenging to incorporate the model in reconstruction due to the increased degree of freedom. We recently have introduced a novel concept of ""kernel"" in MR reconstruction to address the above challenges timely. Our preliminary results on parallel imaging and sparsity-constrained reconstruction demonstrate that the kernel-based algorithms improve the reconstruction quality over the original algorithms with linear prior models. Built upon our strong preliminary results, the objective of this application is to develop an innovative kernel-based framework for MR image reconstruction from undersampled data. This framework does not require explicit knowledge of nonlinear mapping (as in preliminary work) such that a broader family of nonlinear functions can be explored for different clinical applications. The proposed work is expected to advance the field of MR image reconstruction vertically. Specifically, the successful completion of the proposed project will result in a general framework leading to many new algorithms (including two developed in this project) for reconstruction from reduced acquisition. Therefore, virtually all of current clinical MRI could benefit from the improved resolution, image quality, and/or reduced acquisition times that the new framework will facilitate or the novel applications i may enable.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is to develop a general framework and two specific new techniques to improve the spatial resolution and/or reduce the scan time in magnetic resonance imaging and evaluate the performance of the techniques for 3D parallel imaging and quantitative imaging in brain. The development of such novel fast imaging techniques may greatly enhance diagnosis of neurological disease. Therefore the project will potentially benefit numerous subjects and the healthcare system.            ",Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling,8953102,R21EB020861,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Family', 'Freedom', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-linear Models', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R21,2015,180330,73424103,-0.001401211456298916
"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015). He has published in several gastroenterology journals, presented research internationally, and has built the independent collaborations featured in this proposal. Central to this career development award, the candidate will leverage the expertise of several mentors and collaborators to develop deep foundational skillsets in analytic imaging, translational proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods. The University of Michigan houses a nationally recognized Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, internationally recognized proteomics expertise, and a dedicated Analytic Morphomics Group focused on computational image analysis of organs. The mentored research training will be supplemented with focused graduate-level coursework in bioinformatics, medical image analysis, machine learning methodologies, and decision support systems provided through the University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the School of Public Health. The Division of Gastroenterology and Department of Medicine have a history of strong support for Dr. Stidham and will provide the time, resources, and mentorship necessary to achieve his professional and research goals. The training provided through this career development award will be pivotal for the candidate's development as an independent translational investigator focused on individualizing therapeutic management. This research will provide the foundation for future collaborative studies to further develop these and other prognostic tools for the inflammatory bowel diseases.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work evaluates the capabilities of quantitative image analysis and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict the probability of medical response in Crohn's disease. Improved prediction of therapeutic response would tailor Crohn's disease management such that patients unlikely to benefit from medical therapy can proceed to timely surgical management and be spared the risks and costs of modern immunosuppressive treatments.        ",Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease,8968013,K23DK101687,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Colonoscopy', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Fibrosis', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospitalization', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intestinal Fibrosis', 'Intestines', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Serum', 'Steroids', 'Surgical Management', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital imaging', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'improved', 'large bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'lecturer', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2015,181860,641965656,0.020297226064954644
"Face De-Identification for Research and Clinical Use DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses NIH's call to promote data sharing and patient privacy. A major obstacle to sharing of recorded video has been the need to protect participants' identity. Similarly, concern about stigma is a reason that many people in need of mental health services (e.g., in the military) fail to do so. We propose a system to de-identify patients and research participants in video. Face de-identification transfers facial expression automatically from source face images, which are confidential, to target face images, which are not. The system safeguards face anonymity while preserving the facial expression of the original source video. The target video then can communicate the emotion, communicative intent, pain, and neurological or physiological status of the source person without displaying the source person's face. Face de-identification would enable video archive sharing among researchers and clinicians without compromising privacy or confidentiality. Moreover, a version of this system could potentially be used to preserve privacy and anonymity in internet-based interviews. Innovation. The project has four innovations. The approach (1) Removes identity information while retaining facial dynamics; thus preserving the information value of the face to communicate emotion, pain, and related states. (2) Accommodates subtle and spontaneous facial actions, rather than imitating only some predefined molar expressions (e.g., happy or sad). (3) Requires no training steps by target persons. (4) And requires no hand annotation of video. The system is entirely automatic. Approach. The software will take as input a video with the face of a subject (source) and automatically generate or output a video with the face de-identified. The project will use new machine learning and computer vision algorithms for transferring subtle facial expression from a source subject (original video) to a target subject, using only one frontal image of the target subject. A major novelty of the approach is to make the process completely automatic. The algorithm will be validated using commercially available software for face recognition and custom software for facial expression analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sharing of video recordings for research and clinical uses would significantly contribute to scientific discovery and patient diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation. We will develop and validate a fully automatic system that preserves facial expression in video while fully protecting face identity.",Face De-Identification for Research and Clinical Use,8908047,R21MH099487,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confidentiality', 'Custom', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Informed Consent', 'Intention', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Personal Computers', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Source', 'Step training', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Video Recording', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'data sharing', 'graphical user interface', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'patient privacy', 'sex', 'social stigma', 'targeted imaging', 'user-friendly', 'young adult']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,193512,30434536,-0.05551691890865756
"BIGDATA Small Project Structurization and Direct Search of Medical Image Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): IBM estimates that 30% of the entire data in the world is medical information. Medical images occupy a significant portion of medical records with approximately 100 million scans in US and growing every year. In addition, the data size from each scan steadfastly increases as the image resolution improves. These BigData are not structured and due to lack of standardized imaging protocols, they are highly heterogeneous with different spatial resolutions, contrasts, slice orientations, etc. In this project, we will deelop a technology to structure and search medical imaging information, which will make the past data available for education and evidence-based clinical decision-making. In this grant, we will focus on brain MRI, which comprises the largest portion of MRI data. The target community will be physicians who make decisions and the patients will be the ultimate beneficiaries. Currently, radiological image data are stored in clinical database called PACS. The image data in PACS are not structured. Consequently, once the diagnosis of a patient is completed, most of the data in PACS are currently discarded in the archive. Radiologists rely on their experience and education to reach medical decisions. This is a typical problem in medical practice that calls for objective evidence-based medicine. There are many ongoing attempts to structure the text fields of PACS, which include natural language processing of free-text radiological reports, clinical information, and diagnosis. In our approach, we propose to structure the image data, not text fields, to support direct search of images. Namely, physicians will submit an image of a new patient and search past images with similar anatomical phenotypes. Then, the clinical reports of the retrieved data will be compiled for a statistical report of the diagnosis and prognosis. We believe this image structuration is the key to ""unlock the vast amounts of information currently stored"" in PACS and use them for education and modern evidence-based medical decisions. The specific aims are; Objective 1: To develop and test the accuracy of high-throughput image structuration technologies Objective 2: To develop and test the image search engine Objective 3: Capacity Building Requirement: To develop prototype cloud system for data structuration / search services for research and educational purposes n/a",BIGDATA Small Project Structurization and Direct Search of Medical Image Data,8852613,R01EB017638,"['Archives', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Image', 'Information Systems', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'beneficiary', 'clinical decision-making', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'outcome forecast', 'prototype', 'radiologist']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,213115,807432003,-0.008889711838550411
"SCH: Proactive Health Monitoring Using Individualized Analysis of Tissue Elastic* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Existing studies suggest that tissue elasticity is possibly correlated with the aggressiveness of cancers. Based on results from deformable image registration, the proposed project investigates the possibility of tracking the organs movement subject to external forces and geometric constraints, thereby deducing patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters for proactive health monitoring. The objectives of this exploratory research project are (1) to develop a computational framework based on extensive studies of a large cohort of cancer patients, in order to accurately estimate patent-specific tissu elasticity using a coupled biomechanical simulation-optimization framework on a pair of medical images (possibly from ultrasound, mammography, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, or other imaging technologies); (2) to examine potential association between tissue elasticity in different regions with aggressiveness of know/diagnosed cancer in the corresponding regions; (3) to derive predictive models for cancer staging/grading based on recovered patient-specific tissue elasticity and other explanatory variables; (4) to design a health monitoring system based on individualized analysis of tissue elasticity for 'at-risk' groups  who are more likely to develop cancers. This proposal describes a truly ambitious effort and a bold vision that is built upon the investigators' prior scientific accomplishments and strong credentials to potentially transform existing practice to more proactive, preventive, evidence-based health monitoring for individuals at risk of developing cancers. This research is expected to make several major scientific advances. These include new algorithms for non-invasive, image-based techniques for automatic extraction of tissue elasticity parameters without force applications and/or force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new predictive models for cancer staging and grading based on patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters, and a health monitoring system for at-risk groups based on individual tissue elasticity along with other variables. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Other than health monitoring, the patient-specific tissue parameters can be incorporated into medical simulators to perform patient-specific surgical planning, compute desired force-feedback for tele-surgery, design and prototype medical devices, and conduct virtual surgical training.

"Automated Retinal Analysis for Detection of Age Related Macular Degeneration ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study focuses on age-related macular degeneration (AMD) because, left untreated, it is the leading cause of blindness in the adult US population over 50. The goals of this program are twofold. First, the focus is to develop new screening tools to detect individuals with the intermediate stage of AMD, that are otherwise asymptomatic for vision loss, at a stage where they can be referred to a clinician for treatment and follow up, and when vision more likely can be preserved. The second goal is to develop Automated Retinal Image Analysis (ARIA) tools that help characterize Geographic Atrophy (GA), for which novel treatments are being investigated. We are developing data-driven algorithms for AMD screening which leverage recent advances in machine learning and machine intelligence and do not rely on detecting and counting or sizing drusen (a procedure which can be error prone). Instead, our method analyzes a fundus image as a whole using an image classification paradigm, and may also exploit ancillary patient information. Our goal is to use the AREDS dbGaP that includes thousands of images from hundreds of patients and offers a unique opportunity to develop and test these algorithms on a scale that has not previously been possible. Our team consists of the Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute, which will serve as the clinical analysis test site, and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, which will conduct the automated screening software tool analysis, development and testing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goals of this project are twofold. First, in order to work towards improving outcome, our goal is to develop novel software screening tools that allow for the automated detection of individuals with the intermediate stage AMD so that they may be referred to clinicians for follow up and treatment at an earlier stage than would otherwise occur. Second, we will develop new tools to characterize the evolution of GA, for which new treatments are being developed and tested.

"Using NLP to Extract Clinically Important Recommendations from Radiology Reports  Abstract Communication of clinically important follow-up recommendations when abnormalities are identified on imaging studies is prone to error. The absence of an automated system to identify and track radiology follow-up recommendations is an important barrier to ensuring timely follow-up of patients, especially for non-acute but potentially life threatening and unexpected findings. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system to extract clinically important recommendation information from free-text radiology reports. Each radiology report will be preprocessed at the structural, syntactic, and semantic level to generate features that will be used to extract the boundaries of sentences that include recommendation information as well as the details of reason for recommendation, requested imaging test, and recommendation time frame. We will use a large corpus of free-text radiology reports represented by a mixture of modalities (e.g., radiography, computed tomography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) from three different institutions. Using this dataset we will perform the following specific aims: Aim 1. Create a multi- institutional radiology report corpus annotated for clinically important recommendation information; Aim 2. Develop a novel NLP system to extract clinically important recommendations in radiology reports. The proposed research is innovative because it will generate a new text processing approach that can be used to flag reports visually and electronically so that separate workflow processes can be initiated to reduce the chance that necessary investigations or interventions suggested in the report are missed by clinicians. The proposed set of tools will be disseminated to the biomedical informatics community as open source tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Communication of recommendations for necessary investigations and interventions when abnormalities are identified on imaging studies is prone to error. When recommendations are not systematically identified and promptly communicated to referrers, poor patient outcomes can result. We propose to build natural language processing tools to automatically extract clinically important recommendation information from radiology reports.                ",Using NLP to Extract Clinically Important Recommendations from Radiology Reports,8804856,R21EB016872,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidental Findings', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Lung nodule', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Ultrasonography', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Washington', 'Writing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer care', 'care delivery', 'design', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'health care delivery', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'open source', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2015,217500,533302350,-0.007044039138826759
"Advanced retinal image analysis for AMD screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this grant application we propose to develop a screening tool for Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) - the single largest cause for legal blindness among aged Americans. A robust screening test that can be performed by a primary care physician or an optometrist, who can then refer the patient to an ophthalmologist, will be a useful first step in casting a wider net and helping reduce the toll of severe vision loss with timely intervention and patient education.  Large, multi-center studies Age Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) and AREDS2 have shown that vitamin supplements along with minerals and antioxidants slow progression of the disease in patients with intermediate AMD, and those with late AMD in one eye. Identifying the at-risk population for advanced AMD who might benefit from the supplements in a timely manner is a growing problem with the aging baby boomers. The proposed tool, EyeSeeAMD, will analyze color retinal fundus images from a patient, automatically detect the various pathologies associated with AMD, quantify them and recommend if the patient needs to be referred to an expert for further evaluation. We have promising preliminary results in drusen detection, detailed plans for developing the envisioned device, and excellent clinical, research, and engineering teams to guarantee success of the project.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed tool, EyeSeeAMD, will help in triaging age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients who are at higher risk to progress to late AMD by providing an automated method for screening the growing aged-population in a non-invasive manner. Timely intervention will help slow the progression of AMD in such patients. Easy quantification of AMD pathological indicators will spur clinical research and drug discovery process by facilitating early and reliable measurement of efficacy of novel treatment methods.            ",Advanced retinal image analysis for AMD screening,8981869,R43EY025984,"['Address', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antioxidants', 'Applications Grants', 'Architecture', 'Area Under Curve', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'County', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drusen', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Face', 'Fundus', 'Gold', 'Health Services', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Legal Blindness', 'Lesion', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Optometrist', 'Pathology', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Physician Executives', 'Pigments', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Quality of life', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Vitamins', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'clinical care', 'design', 'detector', 'dietary supplements', 'disorder of macula of retina', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'geographic atrophy', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'improved', 'neovascularization', 'novel', 'operation', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NEI,"EYENUK, INC.",R43,2015,224999,1300000,-0.009233105808454756
"Calculation of Percent Body Fat by Analyzing Virtual Body Models ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Excess body fat is a key underlying factor in the development of numerous chronic diseases, including type II diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. The AMA recently declared that obesity, itself, is a disease. Most epidemiologic studies utilize Body Mass Index (BMI) to classify people as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese because it is a convenient and simple method that has been shown to correlate with disease risk. Since the majority of the health risks associated with obesity are more directly linked to an overabundance of body fat than weight, measuring body fat is essential for more precise guidelines. However, accurate methods of assessing body fat are expensive, inconvenient, and require immobile equipment. Consequently, the AMA has called for more cost effective and convenient methods to assess body composition to assist doctors in their assessment and treatment. Virtual modeling of humans in particular has provided ways to scan and analyze the body and its motion. Supervised Machine Learning (SML), a sub-field of artificial intelligence, has made great progress in taking measured data to infer new relationships. It is our belief that virtual modeling and SML can provide the techniques necessary to conveniently and accurately calculate the percentage of body fat (%BF) and to provide new tools in treating obesity based on body shapes. The project will develop a system that uses commercially available depth cameras such as the Microsoft Kinect(r) to capture the surface of the human body. This will be accomplished by developing a new algorithm to perform deformable registration of several RGB-Depth views of the body. A new algorithm that uses SML will be developed to calculate percentage body fat using the surface data. The system will be trained and validated by collecting data from a number of subjects. The surface captured will be used to explore the role of visual body representation in motivation and adherence. The developed systems can be implemented in clinical or personal settings and be utilized as a public health research tool and deployed widely given the low-cost of the hardware required. In addition to the immediate impact that the system will have on managing obesity, the project will have a broad impact on a number of areas. A large database of such shapes captured over time may lead to ways to predict how an individual's body shape will change given a particular intervention. Certain medical conditions that result in body shape change, such as those involving lymphatic circulations, may be diagnosed and tracked more easily. Growth patterns of children may be tracked by change of body shapes. Further research can be conducted to determine the effect of body shape on %BF using data mining techniques.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will develop a new method to capture the 3D surface and shape of a human body and a new method to use these data to calculate percent body fat. By making these tools widely available and economical, the proposed approach has the potential for major contributions in the assessment and treatment of obesity.        ",Calculation of Percent Body Fat by Analyzing Virtual Body Models,8970310,R21HL124443,"['Adherence', 'Age', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Belief', 'Body Composition', 'Body Size', 'Body Surface', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Equipment', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Imagery', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Muscle', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Plethysmography', 'Population Study', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Self Perception', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underweight', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Water', 'Weight', 'Weights and Measures', 'base', 'body density', 'body volume', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'density', 'disorder risk', 'lymphatic circulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'tool', 'virtual', 'weight loss intervention']",NHLBI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,227680,86807134,0.004848735543330091

The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.                ",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9044227,K01ES026835,"['Affect', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Computational Science', 'Consult', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Drug-sensitive', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'global health', 'improved', 'instructor', 'killings', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIEHS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2015,230806,551214295,-0.004766401168269072
"Machine learning with generative mixture models for fetal monitoring     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For many years, there has been a concerted effort to automate the analysis of fetal heart rate (FHR) rhythms. However, despite significant advances in biomedical signal analysis, there has not been any significant improvement in automated decision support systems. FHR monitoring is now ubiquitous throughout delivery rooms, especially using the non-invasive Doppler monitor, but also using the fetal scalp electrode. Physician classification of fetal heart rate patterns is known to be a non-trivial problem because of significant inter and intra-observer variability of diagnosis. This has led to a marked increase in the number of caesarean deliveries, thereby increasing risk to the fetus and mother in many cases. This has further motivated the machine learning community to automate the classification procedure in the interest of accuracy and consistency as well as robustness with respect to noise. Usual approaches to this involve some type of supervised classification procedure, where the algorithm output on training data is compared with a ""gold-standard"" physician classification, followed by testing and validation on new datasets. However, since physician classification can be unreliable in the presence of the aforementioned diagnostic variability, as well as significant tracing noise, we propose the use of unsupervised algorithms to cluster FHR data records into clinically useful categories. We use nonparametric Bayes theory and Markov-time-dependence models for the evolution of feature sequences to propose methods that will achieve improved accuracy. The methods involve extraction of feature sequences from FHR time series data, which are modeled as samples from finite or infinite Dirichlet mixture models. We then use Gibbs sampling to obtain the cluster probabilities for each dataset. Clustering outcomes are compared against direct physician diagnosis and our current results are seen to be in broad agreement with them, while still giving new information on the character of different sub-groups of FHR records. With the proposed research, further gains in classification performance will be made.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Fetal heart rate monitoring is now commonly used during childbirth and, at present, physicians read and interpret these data to classify fetal heart rate patterns and make sure that the baby is not in distress during the course of labor. However, there is great variability in how individual doctors interpret the tracings and this has led increases in the number of caesarean deliveries, thereby potentially increasing risk to both mothers and babies. Thus there has been a concerted effort from the machine learning community to develop an accurate automatic reading and classification procedure so that correct interpretation of fetal heart rates during labor is more diagnostic and consistent.            ",Machine learning with generative mixture models for fetal monitoring,8816208,R21HD080025,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Apgar Score', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Categories', 'Childbirth', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Delivery Rooms', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Distress', 'Electrodes', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Fetal Heart', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Monitoring', 'Fetus', 'Freedom', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Litigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mothers', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Umbilical cord structure', 'Uncertainty', 'Uterine Contraction', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'fetal', 'improved', 'interest', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'stem', 'theories', 'vector']",NICHD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R21,2015,234571,77607041,-0.005727130136628298
"Development and Dissemination of MuscleMiner: An Imaging Informatics Tool for Mus DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Image evaluation of skeletal muscle biopsies is a procedure essential to research and clinical practice. Although widely used, several major limitations exist with respect to current muscle image morphometric measurement, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, retrieval, and mining procedures: 1) Although traditional morphometric parameters, such as cross-sectional area (CSA) and minimum Feret diameter, etc., serve as critical indicators for assessing muscle function, current measurements are still largely based on manual or semi-automated methods, leading to significant labor costs with large potential inter-observer variability. 2) The current archiving of muscle images is still mainy based on outdated tools such as Excel spreadsheets and computer file folders. Given a new muscle image, it is almost impossible to quickly cross-compare, visualize, query, search, and retrieve previous cases exhibiting similar image contents with comparable morphometric measures, for the purpose of either discovering novel biological co-correlations at benchside, or providing personalized diagnosis and prognosis at bedside. 3) Although a typical muscle image often contains millions of data points (pixels), in clinical practice, doctors often condense this rich information into one or two diagnostic labels and discard the rest. Novel image markers, which are not always apparent through visual inspections or not manually quantifiable, but potentially represent critical diagnostic and prognostic values for precision medicine, have not been rigorously examined. Similarly, in basic science research, only a very limited number of known measures (e.g., CSA) are considered. Some non-traditional measures, such as myofiber shapes that hold the potential to serve as new indicators of muscle functions, are not fully investigated. 4) Current muscle image analysis and searching functions are fairly low throughput. As a frontier research area, Cloud computing can handle big image data in a distributed manner by providing high-throughput computational power. However, its application to muscle images has never been explored. MuscleMiner will provide a complete suite of tools for automated image morphometric measurements, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, content-based image retrieval, bioinformatics image mining, and Cloud computing. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) Develop the automated morphometric measurement unit, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) unit, and the image archiving and visualization unit. 2) Develop the advanced bioinformatics image mining unit to assist in the rapid discovery and validation of new image markers. 3) Develop the Cloud computing unit to enable big image data processing and searching functions. Disseminate this freely available, Cloud-enabled imaging informatics system to muscle research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose to develop and disseminate an advanced Cloud-enabled imaging informatics tool - MuscleMiner. MuscleMiner will provide a complete suite of tools for automated image morphometric measurements, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, content-based image retrieval, and bioinformatics image mining. The goal of MuscleMiner is to offer a freely available and powerful tool to help all clinician and basic scienc muscle researchers in their daily work. Beyond fast, objective, reproducible, and automated morphometric measurements, the impact of MuscleMiner will be multiplied by laboratories using the CBIR and visualization units (Aim 1), bioinformatics image mining unit (Aim 2), and Cloud-computing unit (Aim 3) to deeply mine and fully utilize the rich information embedded in large collections of muscle images.",Development and Dissemination of MuscleMiner: An Imaging Informatics Tool for Mus,8922953,R01AR065479,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Cells', 'Client', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Fascicle', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mus', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Shapes', 'Slide', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'System', 'Technology', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical practice', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'frontier', 'image archival system', 'image visualization', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic value', 'skeletal', 'tool', 'wasting']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2015,314327,188894159,-0.006706519050154674
"Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in the laboratory sciences have led to the discovery of a large number of candidate biomarkers, which hold great potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. At this time, an important research bottleneck is the lack of well-developed statistical methods for effectively using these candidate biomarkers to enhance clinical practice. It is our goal to develop new tools to select, combine, and evaluate biomarkers for disease classification and treatment selection. Classification markers predict an individual's disease outcome and are useful for the detection of diseases at an early stage when a treatment is most effective. Research proposed in Aim 1 seeks to select and combine markers to improve the classification performance in disease screening and diagnosis. Treatment selection markers predict a patient's response to different therapies and allow for the selection of a therapy that has the best predicted outcome. Aim 2 seeks to develop marker-based treatment selection rules to maximize the benefit to the patient population. A biomarker that is useful for guiding treatment decision to the general population will have different values to different patients due to individual differences in their response to treatment and in their tolerance of the disease harm and treatment cost. Aim 3 seeks to develop a new graphical tool to customize the evaluation of a biomarker for aiding treatment decision based on personal characteristics.  Our statistical methods will apply broadly to general medical fields. In particular, we will apply these methods to analyze several cancer studies including (1) biomarker studies for prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer from the Early Detection and Research Network; (2) the Women's Health Initiative breast cancer genome-wide association study; and (3) the Oncotype-Dx breast cancer study from the Southwest Oncology Group. Programs and algorithms developed in this proposal will be made available to public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The focus of this proposal is to develop novel statistical methods for the design and analysis of biomarker studies. In particular, the proposed methods will develop marker combinations to improve disease diagnosis, develop treatment selection rules to cost-effectively reduce population disease burden, and help patients and clinicians make informed decisions about the use of medical tests in clinical practices.",Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers,8808769,R01GM106177,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer genome', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2015,324063,758431960,-0.05972077000156602
"3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical assessment of optic nerve swelling is limited by the subjective ophthalmoscopic evaluation by experts in order to diagnose and differentiate the cause of the optic disc edema. The long-term goal of our research effort is to develop automated 3D image-analysis approaches for the identification of an optimal set of 3D parameters to quantify the severity of optic nerve edema over time and to help differentiate the underlying cause. The overall objective in this application is to develop strategies, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve swelling in patients diagnosed with papilledema and to ascertain morphological features that differentiate papilledema from other disorders causing optic nerve edema. The central hypothesis is that information about volumetric and shape parameters obtainable from 3D image analysis techniques will improve the ability to accurately assess the severity and cause of optic disc edema over the existing subjective ophthalmoscopic assessment of optic nerve swelling using the Fris¿n scale or current 2D OCT parameters. The rationale for the proposed research is that having such 3D parameters will dramatically improve the way optic disc swelling is assessed. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1. Develop and evaluate the methodology for computing novel volumetric and shape parameters of a swollen optic nerve head from SD-OCT. This will be completed by refining and evaluating our novel 3D graph-based segmentation algorithms in SD-OCT volumes of patients with optic disc swelling. 2. Identify SD-OCT parameters that optimally correlate with clinical measurements of severity in patients with papilledema and develop a continuous severity scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to relate SD-OCT parameters to expert-defined Fris¿n scale grades (a fundus-based measure of severity). It is anticipated that volumetric 3D parameters will more closely correlate with clinical measures than 2D parameters and will provide a continuous severity scale. 3. Identify SD-OCT parameters that differentiate papilledema from other causes of optic disc swelling (or apparent optic disc swelling, as in pseudopapilledema) and develop a corresponding predictive classifier. Our working hypothesis is that 3D shape parameters, especially those near Bruch's membrane opening, will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach is innovative because the 3D image-analysis methodology developed by the applicants enables novel determination of 3D volumetric and shape parameters and represents a significant improvement over the status quo of using qualitative image information and 2D OCT image information for assessing optic disc swelling. The proposed research is significant because it will help to establish a much-needed alternative and more objective method by which to assess the severity and cause of optic disc swelling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of novel spectral-domain optical coherence tomography parameters for assessing the severity and cause of optic nerve edema is expected to enable more efficient and effective diagnosis and management strategies of patients with such swelling. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to reduce the burdens of disability and is particularly relevant to the part of NEI's mission regarding understanding blinding eye diseases and preserving sight.",3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema,8842639,R01EY023279,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Papilledema', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Swelling', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'digital', 'disability burden', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2015,332955,193405667,0.005702179153097633
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into the causes, pathogenesis, and natural history of DILI. The ongoing Retrospective study has collected 109 DNA samples from subjects with liver injury attributed to one of 8 drugs. In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and outcomes of drug induced liver injury via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients into the ongoing DILIN Prospective and Retrospective studies. The collection of early blood and urine samples from well-characterized DILI patients will allow for innovative studies of patient, drug and environmental risk factors. Further development of a computerized diagnostic instrument and expansion of the LiverTox website is also planned which will provide doctors, researchers, and the general public an authoritative and up-to-date resource that can help accelerate DILI research in the US and abroad.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013,8920543,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anabolic steroids', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Ancillary Study', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Budesonide', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Expert Opinion', 'Floxacillin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Health', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Histopathology', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Injury to Liver', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular', 'Monograph', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Valproic Acid', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'chemical property', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'elastography', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'repository', 'screening', 'transcriptomics', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2015,335210,641965656,-0.017398465194651654
"Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Designing an efficient Huntington's disease (HD) early intervention clinical trial for individuals who have an expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene requires identifying and combining clinical, biological, cognitive, and brain imaging markers to accurately distinguish among subjects who will have a diagnosis during a given intervention period and those who will not, and to track early changes in the disease course. The goal of this project is to identify sensitive biomarkers for HD risk stratification, indexing disease progression, and developing clinical trial endpoints. The proposal directly adheres to ""2P's"" of the NIH New Strategic Vision of the ""4P's"" of Medicine: they will offer promising ways to predict when the disease will develop; and increase the capacity to personalize early intervention based on the informative patient-specific markers our models identify. Combining biomarkers to predict HD onset and progression is an essential step in a continuum of research for development of disease-modifying therapies. Composite markers and their risk profiles created from our model will offer quantitative way to monitor and compare potential interventions. Evidence collected from these comparisons will advance the development of efficacy studies in premanifest HD, where neuroprotective treatments would be most beneficial. We develop and apply a series of cutting-edge statistical learning methods based on support vector machine (SVM), variable selection, and dimension reduction to achieve these goals. These modern statistical methods designed for correlated big data have quickly emerged as among the most successful tools for hypothesis generation, classification and prediction in biomedical studies. However, they have not been introduced to HD biomarker research. In aim 1, using counting process, we propose SVM to handle time-to-event outcomes (e.g., time-to-HD-diagnosis) to combine markers into risk scores to discriminate subjects who will experience HD onset in the immediate future from those who will not,  based on their personalized features. Although SVM is well studied for binary outcomes, it is far less explored for time-to-event outcomes. We fill this gap in knowledge. In aim 2, we propose new learning methods for longitudinal outcomes to combine markers that modify the course of HD signs to monitor disease process and distinguish subjects with rapid progression from those with slower progression. In aim 3, we propose to use novel and robust performance measures to compare derived combined markers with existing disease indices and key markers. These aims will fundamentally advance our understanding of markers linked to HD onset and progression. The creation of statistical models for composite markers and risk profiles is especially useful in: (1) offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare potential interventions, and (2) improving power of efficacy studies targeted at premanifest individuals by narrowing the predictive interval which leads to future clinical trials that can be made shorter with fewer subjects. Finally, our improved predictions of HD onset and progression will provide more informative genetic counseling sessions for pre-symptomatic subjects at risk of HD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of Huntington's disease (HD) research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay onset or slow disease progression, and to provide different treatment regimens at each disease stage. To meet this goal, this proposal develops and applies a series of advanced statistical approaches to rank and combine clinical, behavioral, and brain imaging markers to predict HD diagnosis in premanifest subjects during a given time period and to measure disease progression. The creation of model for composite markers and risk profiles is useful in offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare interventions and powering clinical trials for premanifest HD individuals.",Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.,8896079,U01NS082062,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'CAG repeat', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Early intervention trials', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic screening method', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'affection', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'human Huntingtin protein', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'research and development', 'tool']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2015,339691,558628098,-0.022449068828103984
"Multimodal image registration by proxy image synthesis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Image registration is a fundamentally important capability in modern neuroscience and clinical medicine. Normalization in functional imaging studies, studies of shape changes in growth, aging, and disease, overlaying surgical plans on intraoperative images, and geometric distortion correction are examples of important applications of image registration. There are dozens of needs for registration in both intrasubject and intersubject applications as well. Therefore, any improvement in image registration performance will have an immediate impact on the scientific and clinical communities. Despite numerous advances in image reconstruction algorithms, the use of multiple modalities (or tissue contrasts) to carry out image registration is a virtually untapped area. The vastly dominant framework is to register a single image of the subject to another single image of the target, and if multiple images are available of either subject or target, they are registered by using the transformation derived from the single image registration. The proposed research will develop, evaluate, and validate a very simply explained but quite radical idea for multi-modal registration. The basic idea is to synthesize a ""proxy"" image from the subject image that has the same tissue contrast and intensity range as the target image and then use a conventional metric such as sum-of-square difference to carry out the registration between the subject proxy and target. Preliminary results demonstrate significant benefits in this approach. In the grant we will: 1) Optimize ""proxy"" multimodal image registration by exploring its theoretical justification as well a key parameters of the overall approach; 2) Apply ""proxy"" multimodal image registration to three key applications in neuroscience in order to validate the method and develop principles of best practice; and 3) Write open source software to carry out image synthesis, similarity computation, and rigid and deformable registration using the ""proxy"" image concept. Both the software to synthesize images for use in a user's favorite image registration method as well as software to carry out the entire ""proxy"" registration process in an optimized way will be made publicly available as open source computer code. The results of this research will lead to a new era in image registration by changing the way researchers and practitioners acquire and use data for neuroscientific studies and clinical medicine.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medical image registration is a method used throughout clinical medicine and medical research and it is vital to the success of many treatments and therapies and for answering a myriad of important scientific questions. This research will permit better alignment by devising and testing a new similarity criterion for multimodal images using the first significantly new approach in over a decade. The result will be better alignment of these images, which will enable better clinical diagnosis and prognosis and more significant research discoveries.

"Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this small business innovations research (SBIR) project we present EyeArt, a retinal image analysis tool for automated diabetic retinopathy (DR) screenings with high diag- nostic efficacy. With its interface to EyePACS, a license-free, scalable telemedicine plat- form, EyeArt will aid the expansion of DR screening and help bridge the exponentially growing disparity between the number of diabetic patients and the number of eye-care providers. Research suggests that the Latino population in general are genetically predisposed to develop diabetes. Their vulnerability to vision loss due to diabetic retinopathy is further compounded by factors such as lack of access to ophthalmology clinicians, lack of insurance, and lack of education. According to the Department of Health Services (DHS) in Los Angeles County (LAC) the situation for diabetics is particularly grim, with current wait times upwards of 6-9 months for retinal examinations for retinopathy screening. This can lead to treatment delays and progression towards irreversible vision loss. To help reduce risk of vision loss in this diabetic population, we propose to use advanced image analysis algorithms in conjunction with existing telemedicine initiatives to enable faster screening, allow reprioritizatin of ophthalmologist appointments, and aid in triage of high-risk patients. Our phase I prototype automatic DR screening tool has already shown great potential by beating current academic and commercial DR screening ap- proaches on large public retinal datasets. Going forward, we will build on our approach and further develop innovative, customized algorithms for critical low-level image processing steps, while leveraging on recent advances in computer vision, and machine learning areas for high-level, inference steps to produce a clinical grade DR screening tool. Our lesion localization and screening engine will be functionally integrated with EyePACS to further drive the expansion of screening, particularly benefiting under- resourced screening programs like the LAC-DHS safety net and its large Hispanic diabetic population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: EyeArt - an automated retinal image analysis tool will help in triaging patients in need of expert care and thus reduce the cost of diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening, while leading to an expansion of screening in primary care centers through its easily accessible telemedicine interface. This increased access to DR care will help prevent vision loss due to diabetes complications in vulnerable disparity populations such as Latinos who do not get screened due to socio-economic factors. To make an immediate impact we are collaborating with Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LAC-DHS) to deploy our system, following clinical validation, in their under-resourced safety net teleretinal screening setup whic caters to large disparity populations of LA County.",Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Applications,8891422,R44EB013585,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Background Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Blindness', 'California', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Color', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consult', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Economic Factors', 'Economically Deprived Population', 'Education', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Faculty', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Hispanics', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Insurance', 'International', 'Latino', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Licensing', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'ROC Curve', 'Reader', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical care', 'cloud based', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'experience', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'safety net', 'screening', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIBIB,"EYENUK, INC.",R44,2015,394177,1300000,-0.001893866831997729
"Daily Immune Monitoring in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating condition characterized by profound, chronic fatigue that is not alleviated by rest, as well as pain, post-exertional malaise, and impairments in memory and concentration. ME/CFS affects over one million women in the United States, causing significant distress and loss of function in affected individuals and a significant financial burden on society Because the underlying pathophysiology of ME/CFS is not well-understood, there are no effective treatments developed specifically for the condition, and many patients are unsatisfied with existing treatment options. Previous research provides a strong case for inflammatory involvement in ME/CFS, though no immune factors have been consistently predictive of fatigue across studies. Conventional cross-sectional research approaches may not be sufficiently sensitive for identifying ME/CFS biomarkers in cases of low-level or atypical inflammation. We have observed that women with ME/CFS demonstrate considerable day-to-day variability in their fatigue severity, and this variability may reflect rapid shifts in underlying disease mechanisms. By viewing the daily fatigue variability as an important signal, and collecting blood samples daily, we have identified a small set of serum cytokines that are strongly correlated with changes in ME/CFS 1fatigue. In this proposed study, we plan to confirm our preliminary findings of immune-fatigue relationships in a larger sample. We will collect blood samples for 25 consecutive days in 70 women with ME/CFS, as well as 20 healthy controls and 20 active fatigue controls (individuals with hypothyroidism). Blood samples will be analyzed for 51 different immune factors associated with inflammation. In addition, participants will submit daily reports of fatigue severity on handheld computers. By analyzing fatigue scores and cytokine concentrations longitudinally, we can identify cytokines that ""track"" day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. This approach will allow us to develop a physiological profile that distinguishes high fatigue days from low fatigue days, providing important information about ME/CFS mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will develop a physiological model that uses serum cytokine levels to accurately predict day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. In Aim 2, we will define important ME/CFS subgroups based on cytokine-fatigue relationships. In Aim 3, we will develop a temporal pathway between immune factors and fatigue that identifies early drivers of fatigue. Additionally, we will develop a specimen bank of blood samples that can be made available to other interested researchers. Intensive longitudinal immune monitoring is a unique approach to understanding ME/CFS pathophysiology. Biomarkers revealed by this research will serve as tools in the development of ME/CFS diagnostic tests, and will provide excellent targets for developing improved therapies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a debilitating and poorly understood condition that affects over one million women in the United States. Our goal with this project is to identify biological targets that will allow better treatments for chronic fatigue to e developed. Our unique approach for discovering biomarkers involves monitoring fatigue and immune factor concentrations on a daily basis.

"Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build and test a dynamic vascular optical tomographic imaging (DVOTI) system that can be used to detect and monitor peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is estimated to affect approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. However, the disease is considerably under-diagnosed, since most patients are asymptomatic and no single reliable screening modality has been established. Most of the undiagnosed and untreated patients are diabetics. They commonly suffer from peripheral neuropathy and hence do not sense and report symptoms (such as pain) that are early signs of the disease. Consequently more than 60% (~65,000 per year) of all lower extremity amputations in the United States are performed in diabetic patients with PAD. With the number of diabetic patients expected to triple and reach almost 100 million by 2050, the problems related to undiagnosed PAD will only rise in the years to come  The most widely used diagnostic test for PAD, determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in conjunction with pulse-volume recordings (PVR), is known to be unreliable for diabetics. And even in non- diabetics, ABI with PVR and all other existing diagnostic tests (such as Duplex Ultrasound or Magnetic resonance angiography), only provides accurate information about proximal occlusions in major arteries of the leg. However, none of these tests assess the distal perfusion of the foot where most complications, such as ulcers and gangrene, typically occur. Monitoring the success of surgical interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, suffers from the same shortcomings, as physicians are limited to the same suite of tests that are inadequate to assess the perfusion of the foot.  Dynamic VOTI promises to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic and monitoring techniques and has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift concerning how vascular diseases are assessed. In preliminary studies we have shown that DVOTI can provide three-dimensional time-series images that provide valuable information about the perfusion of the vascular bed in feet of PAD patients. The near-infrared light used in the instrument has no adverse health effects and measurements can be repeated frequently to monitor post interventional progress. Therefore, we believe that DVOTI will prove to be a safe and accurate method to diagnose and monitor PAD in non-diabetic and diabetic patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build and test a novel optical imaging system that will allow for the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. The disease is considerably under-diagnosed, especially in diabetic patients, the elderly, and patients with kidney disease. The system will address an unmet need to directly assess the degree of blood perfusion in the feet, where most PAD-related complications occur, which lead to over 65,000 amputations each year.",Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease,8896855,R01HL115336,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Angioplasty', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Gangrene', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preventive', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ulcer', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'blood perfusion', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'foot', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging system', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'light emission', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optical imaging', 'post intervention', 'prototype', 'screening', 'success', 'theories', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'vascular bed']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2015,542263,558628098,-3.723330983286885e-05
"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We will use a novel statistical approach to develop and validate the models.",Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler,8839318,R01NS082304,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anterior', 'Anterior Horn Cells', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Natural History', 'Neuraxis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Riluzole', 'Spinal', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'screening', 'spinal tract', 'treatment trial']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,577490,641965656,-0.014272865804155831
"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will make it possible for a wide community of researchers who collect and analyze medical imaging data to take advantage of a new class of computer algorithms that very accurately label and measure anatomical structures and pathological formations in medical images.

"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart transplant (Tx) surgery is a well-established life-saving procedure, but is associated with post- interventional risks such as acute cardiac rejection (ACR) which is one of the leading causes of death in the first year after transplant. Beyond the first year, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the single greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality. Monitoring the patient for post-transplant events is thus paramount. The standard monitoring strategy, however, relies on frequent (12-16 monitoring nodes during year 1 alone) invasive and costly procedures including endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) and catheter angiography. Since EMB and catheter angiography have limited sensitivity due to sampling errors (ACR) or the diffuse nature of the disease (CAV), a reliable non-invasive alternative for the early detection of ACR and CAV would be desirable to reduce the need for invasive procedures, improve sensitivity, and reduce cost. We have recently developed and applied cardiac MRI techniques for the non-invasive assessment of myocardial edema (T2-mapping), diffuse fibrosis (pre- and post-contrast T1-mapping), myocardial velocities (tissue phase mapping), and microvascular quantitative perfusion. We have shown that these techniques can identify distinct regional structural and functional alterations in the heart that correlate with te status of the allograft. Based on these findings, a detailed cost-effective analysis using Markov modeling and decision tree analysis has demonstrated that cardiac MR has tremendous potential to reduce monitoring costs by 40-50% during the first year after Tx alone. This proposal builds on these promising findings and our aim is to develop an new 15-minute structure-function cardiac MRI protocol for the improved detection regional abnormalities associated with ACR (edema, fibrosis, dysfunction) and CAV (perfusion, dysfunction). Integration of MRI with echocardiography and intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) will provide unique multi-modality assessment of the allograft. The application in a longitudinal clinical study coupled with state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis will allow redefining the most effective post-Tx mixed monitoring strategy. The aim is to to help clinicians identify the optimal mixed monitoring strategy, i.e. the optimal combination of multi-modality imaging (structure-function MRI, echo, IVUS) and invasive procedures (EMB, catheter angiography) which provide best outcome (quality adjusted life days) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop a multi-modality imaging protocol for the non-invasive characterization of tissue and function of the left and right heart in patients after heart transplantation. Our aim is to develop a new non- invasive 15 minute diagnostic test in order to provide a previously unattainable quantitative characterization of myocardial structure-function deficits in cardiac transplant patients. The application in a longitudinal clinial study coupled with cost-effectiveness analysis and decision tree modeling will allow to improve current monitoring strategies by combining cardiac MRI, echocardiography, intravascular ultrasound and invasive tests (biopsy, catheter angiography) to provide the best outcome (quality of life days, mortality) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient.",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,8797337,R01HL117888,"['Acute', 'Allografting', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost utility', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling Errors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'base', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'extracellular', 'follow-up', 'heart allograft', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'two-arm study']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2015,596707,367414121,0.011722462868359476
"High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before a heart attack, and predict risk in millions of patients annually. This is currently limited by the need fo visual interpretation, which is highly variable and depends on the physician's experience. The long-term objective of this program is to improve the interpretation of this widely used heart imaging technique-achieving higher accuracy for disease detection than it is possible by the best attainable visual analysis. This proposal builds on our prior work in conventional myocardial MPS, and focuses on fast, low-radiation MPS imaging (fast-MPS) obtained by new high-efficiency scanners. Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS. The algorithms will include better heart muscle detection by training with correlated anatomical data and a novel approach for mapping the probability of abnormal perfusion for each location of the heart muscle; 2) enhance the diagnosis of heart disease from fast-MPS by machine- learning algorithms that integrate clinical data, stress test parameters, and quantitative image features; 3) demonstrate the clinical utility of the new algorithms applied to automatic canceling of the rest portion of the MPS scan, when not needed. The new system will be more accurate than the clinical expert analysis in the detection of obstructive coronary disease. By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,8906912,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Stress', 'Stress Tests', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2015,685014,90419233,-0.0077661666671687765
"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more. This will be accomplished by: optimizing the image processing that is used, further developing new and better image processing methods, and developing a method of ""personalized imaging"", in which, for each individual patient, the minimum amount of imaging agent needed to obtain a good image is computed.",Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging,8842707,R01HL122484,"['4D Imaging', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Protection', 'Radioactive', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical practice', 'computer program', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'predictive modeling', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2015,758935,8894636,0.005546937946612407

"Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 award will support my development as an independent investigator with a translational research program that specializes in the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Candidate: My research experience as a cognitive neuroscientist ideally positions me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise on the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative disease. I have strong cognitive training with an M.Sc in Psycholinguistics and Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where I was supported by an NRSA Individual Predoctoral Award. During my postdoctoral IGERT fellowship at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I was awarded an NRSA Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship Award to investigate the role of decision-making in language. In this research I have gained experience investigating neurodegenerative disease patients comparatively in order to obtain converging evidence to complement fMRI studies of healthy adults. I have become increasingly interested in translating my research to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. I was recently award the Society for the Neurobiology of Language Postdoctoral Merit Award in recognition of my novel research investigating how social limitations in patients contribute to difficulty in discourse. I have committed to four years of clinical research the NIH Loan Repayment Program, and I intend to commit to clinical research for the duration of my career. I have learned that cognitive and neuroimaging studies provide only one perspective on neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal, I plan to gain the necessary expertise in biological aspects of FTLD and related conditions to complement my past experiences, and thus achieve my goal of becoming a multifaceted independent investigator with expertise in the cognitive and biological basis for neurodegenerative diseases. With the support of this K01, I will develop expertise to conduct investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, and neuropathological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. I will ultimately integrate the biological expertise gained in this proposal with language studies from my cognitive neuroscience research in an effort to identify non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to screen patients for clinical trials and to measure the efficacy of disease-modifying agents. Environment: This award will be conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Neurology, the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR), and the Penn Bioinformatics Center where I have strong institutional support. The proposed institution is an exceptional environment that has expert centers for neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, a leading genetic research core, expert neuropathology, outstanding biostatisical support, and relevant clinical research laboratories. The University of Pennsylvania is unique in comparison to other institutions in the country because all of the above methods are available in one center. My mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentor, Dr. John Trojanowksi, have international reputations for neurodegenerative disease research. My career development will also be supported by my co-mentor, Dr. Lyle Ungar, who has extensive expertise in statistical learning algorithms and in the analysis of proteomic and genomics datasets. Together, this mentorship team will facilitate my development as an independent investigator by providing access to existing and future collaborators, laboratory resources, and exceptional training environments. The CNDR is a world- leading center for neurodegenerative disease research with human and animal models of disease and exceptional translational science. Biofluid biomarker experience is extensive, and several national biofluid cores are centered at Penn (e.g. ADNI). There is a wealth of internationally-recognized neuroimaging expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Imaging and Computer Science Laboratory, and I will benefit by integrating neuroimaging resources from these facilities with other modalities of biomarker research. Training: I will develop my expertise in the biological basis of neurodegenerative disease with the support of my mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentors, Dr. John Trojanowski and Dr. Lyle Ungar. Specifically, with Dr. Trojanowksi I will engage in training related to biofluid and genetic biomarkers of FTLD. I will develop advanced neuroimaging skills and cutting-edge biostatistical methods with Dr. Ungar. Each of these training modalities will be supported by complementary formal coursework, participation in seminars, attendance of conferences, and regularly scheduled meetings with mentorship team. Research: FTLD is a neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 15 out of 100,000 individuals. In recent years detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have demonstrated distinct sources of histopathological abnormalities in FTLD, including the presence of tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). However, there are currently no in vivo methods for discriminating between FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. There is an urgent need to improve the in vivo diagnosis of FTLD to appropriately enter patients into emerging clinical trials, and to develop sensitive and specific endpoints in trials that can quantify response to these treatments. The overall research aim of this proposal is to develop multimodal methods to improve in vivo diagnosis of FTLD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) affects approximately 15 out of 100,000 adults.

"Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career transition award will provide the applicant with protected research time to develop an independent research career in biomedical informatics. Dr. Starkey received his M.D. in 2003 from UT Southwestern, completed the NLM Biomedical Informatics Training Program post-doctoral fellowship in 2011 and earned a Ph.D. focusing on clinical informatics from the Clinical Sciences Degree Program at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston in 2012. Dr. Starkey accepted a faculty position at the Institute for Translational Sciences at UTMB that is currently supporting his transition to independent investigator. Dr. Starkey will utilize the career transition award for novel applications of advanced machine learning methods to create predictive models of disease. Predictive models of disease allow for the stratification of risk and prevention of disease and have been successfully implemented in the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. Predictive models of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are an active area of research since CKD is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and end-stage renal disease. However, there is not a single predictive model of CKD created for application to Hispanics and the external validity of existing models is poor. The objective of this project is to create predictive models of chronic kidney disease in a Hispanic population and quantify biomarkers of chronic kidney disease using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomics in this minority population. MRM proteomics will utilize the UTMB Novel Methodologies core and its array of resources to create an inter-institutional collaboration. Heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods will be used to create the predictive model of chronic kidney disease in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC). Established in 2004, the CCHC is a random population sample in Brownsville, Texas created to evaluate the determinants of health in a US/Mexico border population that is primarily of Hispanic ethnicity. The CCHC has an extremely high prevalence of obesity and diabetes at 49.7% and 30.3%, respectively. Both obesity and diabetes are independent risk factors for the development of CKD and represent significant health disparities in the Hispanic population. Archived serum samples of CCHC participants and the CCHC database will be utilized to complete the following aims: 1) Create predictive models of CKD in a Hispanic population 2) Refine the predictive models by including clinical laboratory data and a selective reaction monitoring mass spectrometry panel of biomarkers. At the completion of this project, predictive models of CKD applicable to a Hispanic population will be created and MRM proteomics will demonstrate utility of biomarkers identified in other populations. The application of the results will be used to create clinical tools for CKD risk and guide future studies in this Hispanic population with health disparities. Importantly, it will provide a career transition for D. Starkey to demonstrate the knowledge gained during his training that results in impactful research and publications.              PROJECT NARRATIVE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because it allows stratification of chronic kidney disease risk and quantifies biomarkers of chronic kidney disease in the Hispanic minority whom has significant health disparities with regard to kidney disease.

The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes.  Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.            ",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection,8699494,K23AI097225,"['Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Area', 'Aspergillosis', 'Aspergillus', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breath Tests', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Dolin', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Exhalation', 'Fingerprint', 'Fusarium', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Mucorales', 'Mucormycosis', 'Mycoses', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scedosporium', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Glutamate', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Spectrometry', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The science of Mycology', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vial device', 'Woman', 'Work', 'air sampling', 'base', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cooking', 'data mining', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2014,137160,327644200,0.0007737479008024604
"HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research     DESCRIPTION:   My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator who harnesses biomedical Big Data Science for the investigation of multilevel influences on health. To continue my progress towards this goal, I am proposing to build the infrastructure to establish a neighborhood data repository, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers and policy makers. I am a highly trained researcher in social epidemiology and quantitative analyses, particularly large health surveys. Before coming to Utah, I worked as a full-time statistical programmer/data analyst on a NIH-funded project to evaluate the health effects of a large neighborhood relocation policy experiment on low-income families in five cities. Our study results suggested that moving from high- to lower poverty neighborhood is related to reductions in obesity and diabetes and improved mental health. Other extant research has provided evidence on associations between the neighborhood environment and mortality and morbidity-even after adjusting for individual characteristics. Poor access to healthy food, fast food chains, the lack of recreational facilities, and higher crime rates all correlate with hiher obesity rates. Nonetheless, the dearth of neighborhood data, especially measures of neighborhood quality that are consistent across geographic areas, limits neighborhood effects research. Moreover, neighborhoods are not only defined by their resources, but also by the social interactions and activities of people who live there. The widespread usage of the internet and open recording of many transactions has led to the availability of massive amounts of data that permits capture of previously hidden micro-level interactions. We will build the data algorithms and infrastructure to harness relatively untapped, cost efficient, and pervasive social media data to develop neighborhood indicators such as food themes, healthiness of food mentions, frequency of exercise/recreation mentions, metabolic intensity of physical activities, and happiness levels. The creation of HashtagHealth requires the use and refinement of Big Data methods to perform data mining, processing and storing of heterogeneous, unstructured data. We will build a testable version of HashtagHealth for the state of Utah and then apply the data resource to the examination of neighborhood effects on young adult obesity. My rigorous training and previous research experiences in social determinants of health, causal inference, and data analyses uniquely prepare me to make significant contributions to the field of Big Data, particularly at the intersection of public health and social sciences.  My Specific Aims are: 1) to develop a neighborhood data resource, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers, 2) to develop Big Data techniques to produce novel neighborhood quality indicators (e.g., healthiness of food mentions, frequency and type of exercise/recreation and happiness levels), and 3) to utilize HashtagHealth and individual-level data from the Utah Population Database to investigate neighborhood influences on obesity among young adults. My mentorship team includes experts in biomedical research (Drs. Ken Smith, Jim VanDerslice), computer science (Dr. Feifei Li), and statistics (Dr. Ming Wen). My team has the breadth of expertise to help me obtain critical multidisciplinary skills and successfully implement my research aims. In addition to my research aims, my Specific Career Development Aims include the following: 1) to develop expertise in data mining and database systems, 2) to acquire training in natural language processing and machine learning, 3) to further gain knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), 4) to develop expertise in study design and analysis of neighborhood effects, and 5) and to develop grant writing and research management skills to lead future projects. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to successfully compete for R01 funding to create a national neighborhood data repository and to investigate national patterns of neighborhood effects on obesity. This proposal makes significant, relevant contributions to the field because 1) neighborhood environments are increasingly linked to important health outcomes, and 2) this project addresses the limits to research resulting from the lack of neighborhood data by providing new, cost-efficient data resources and methods for characterizing neighborhoods.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic rise in obesity and related chronic diseases in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. My overarching career goal is to contribute to the improvement of population health by conducting research in social determinants of health and developing new methodologies to address multidimensional research questions. The development of the Hashtag Health data repository will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of social media data to capture social and cultural processes with potential impact on health.            ",HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research,8828979,K01ES025433,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Communications Media', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Food Chain', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Database', 'Poverty', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'fast food', 'food consumption', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'news', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'young adult']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2014,155674,228951281,-0.004051781545304218
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,8723038,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'human CCL26 protein', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2014,156324,507546965,-0.021467823945147596
"The Cardiovascular Research Grid DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The Cardiovascular Research Grid (CVRG) Project is an R24 resource supporting the informatics needs of the cardiovascular (CV) research community.

"ENTROPY-BASED TISSUE DISCRIMINATORS     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major problem addressed in this proposal is the development and evaluation of an automated noninvasive approach to discriminate different normal and pathological tissue types using machine learning algorithms; previous applications of machine learning have been based on features of the backscattered ultrasound that are essentially energy based. Our approach will be based on extracting features from images whose pixels are determined by the entropy contained in segments of the backscattered ultrasound. The unique attributes of entropy imaging suggest that the automated analysis we propose would be particularly robust for discrimination of deep tissues in a clinical environment.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: All skilled clinical practitioners and interpreters of ultrasound studies realize that much information exists in recorded US images that is processed immediately by the visual cortex and is useful for qualitatively defining pathology, yet defies ready quantification by any robust algorithm. Traditional energy-based representations display grayscale intensities and speckle patterns that have been mapped parametrically into various tissue classification schemes that have yet to demonstrate organ or tissue specificity, although progress has been reported in distinguishing pathologies over the last 30 years. However, the fact that US signal processing and representation of backscatter data in terms of energy functions has not changed over the last 50 years suggests that alternative signal processing schemes may be indicated to represent the richness of the information contained within the backscattered data. To meet this challenge, we have been involved over the past 10 years in processing backscattered RF to create ""information"" images and in designing ""information sensitive"" approaches to classifying the data sets based on statistical analysis of these images These novel and user independent metrics utilize the entropy of windowed segments of radiofrequency (RF) backscatter signal from tis- sue, which represents a radical departure from grayscale or speckle metrics. In this approach the entropy of the backscattered segment is used to produce a pixel value in the tissue image. This processing strategy has proven to be sensitive to weak, sub-resolution sized changes in tissue.

"Face De-Identification for Research and Clinical Use     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses NIH's call to promote data sharing and patient privacy. A major obstacle to sharing of recorded video has been the need to protect participants' identity. Similarly, concern about stigma is a reason that many people in need of mental health services (e.g., in the military) fail to do so. We propose a system to de-identify patients and research participants in video. Face de-identification transfers facial expression automatically from source face images, which are confidential, to target face images, which are not. The system safeguards face anonymity while preserving the facial expression of the original source video. The target video then can communicate the emotion, communicative intent, pain, and neurological or physiological status of the source person without displaying the source person's face. Face de-identification would enable video archive sharing among researchers and clinicians without compromising privacy or confidentiality. Moreover, a version of this system could potentially be used to preserve privacy and anonymity in internet-based interviews. Innovation. The project has four innovations. The approach (1) Removes identity information while retaining facial dynamics; thus preserving the information value of the face to communicate emotion, pain, and related states. (2) Accommodates subtle and spontaneous facial actions, rather than imitating only some predefined molar expressions (e.g., happy or sad). (3) Requires no training steps by target persons. (4) And requires no hand annotation of video. The system is entirely automatic. Approach. The software will take as input a video with the face of a subject (source) and automatically generate or output a video with the face de-identified. The project will use new machine learning and computer vision algorithms for transferring subtle facial expression from a source subject (original video) to a target subject, using only one frontal image of the target subject. A major novelty of the approach is to make the process completely automatic. The algorithm will be validated using commercially available software for face recognition and custom software for facial expression analysis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sharing of video recordings for research and clinical uses would significantly contribute to scientific discovery and patient diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation. We will develop and validate a fully automatic system that preserves facial expression in video while fully protecting face identity.            ",Face De-Identification for Research and Clinical Use,8772435,R21MH099487,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confidentiality', 'Custom', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Image', 'Informed Consent', 'Intention', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Personal Computers', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Source', 'Step training', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Video Recording', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'data sharing', 'graphical user interface', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'patient privacy', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'social stigma', 'user-friendly', 'young adult']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,194915,30434536,-0.05551691890865756
"In-field FAST Procedure Support and Automation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) procedure is an ultrasound examination performed to identify intra-peritoneal hemorrhage or pericardial tamponade. FAST involves the detection of free fluid in ultrasound images from four specific abdominal areas. Unstable patients with positive FAST results are operated on, and stable patients with negative results tend to be observed.  We propose to develop the hardware and image analysis algorithms necessary for novice ultrasound operators to perform life-saving FAST procedures. The proposed system will consist of a low-cost ultrasound probe, connected to a ruggedize tablet computer, running innovative computer vision algorithms, embedded in an intuitive application. Using that system, a novice operator will be visually guided to acquire ultrasound images from the abdominal locations and quantify the free fluid in those images.  The target for our initial deployment of the system is level 3 and 4 trauma centers. These centers must often serve areas spanning hundreds and even thousands of miles; however, they are typically under-staffed and under-equipped.  The proposal is being clinically driven by Jeffrey Lowell, MD. He is a USNR Trauma Surgeon, and he was recently deployed to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, the only Level I Trauma Center outside the U.S.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) procedure is an ultrasound-based examination for rapidly detecting blood in the abdomen, particularly after blunt abdominal trauma, which is common, for example, with car accidents. The challenge is that the FAST procedure requires expertise and equipment which is not commonly available at level 3 and 4 trauma centers that serve rural populations. We propose to develop the hardware and image analysis algorithms necessary for novice ultrasound operators to perform life- saving FAST procedures.

"Improving Prematurity-related Respiratory Outcomes at Vanderbilt (IMPROV) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease that impacts the pulmonary and overall health of more than 10,000 infants in the US each year. The long-term objective of this Clinical Research Center (CRC) is translation of biochemical, genetic and bioinformatics research into innovative interventions that improve outcomes of extremely preterm infants at risk for long- term pulmonary morbidity. Our proposal focuses specifically on the urea cycle-nitric oxide (UC-NO) and glutathione (GSH) pathways as pivotal and interrelated mechanisms in the response of the developing lung to the extrauterine environment. Overall hypotheses: (1) Biochemical immaturity and functional genetic variation in the UC-NO and GSH pathways modulate the BPD phenotype spectrum; (2) The duration and degree of NO insufficiency and free radical excess predicts BPD severity and correlates with pulmonary morbidity after NICU discharge. To investigate our hypothesis, our CRC will enroll 250 infants with birthweights 510-1250 grams and follow the survivors through 1 year of life. Our hypothesis invokes an immature hepatic and gut synthetic capacity to make citrulline and GSH, functional genetic variations in the UC-NO and GSH pathways, nutritional deficiencies and the physiologic and environmental stress of preterm birth. The resultant NO deficiency and free radical excess alters pulmonary vascular and alveolar development. Our biomarker discovery concept includes (a) collection of plasma, urine, red blood cells, DNA and tracheal aspirates for measurements of NO and GSH precursor sufficiency, production of NO metabolites and GSH, functional genetic variants in these pathways, and biomarkers of in vivo oxidative stress and (b) validation of these biomarkers for diagnosis and long term prognosis of patients with BPD. A bioinformatics approach using machine learning and predictive modeling has been developed for respiratory phenotyping and risk stratification at 36 weeks and 40 weeks postmenstrual age and at 12 months after hospital discharge. Accomplishment of these goals will promote novel clinical trials design to test new therapies to prevent BPD and improve long term pulmonary health of infants born preterm. (End of Abstract)      RELEVANCE: Each year in the US, more than 10,000 premature infants develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease associated with prolonged and recurrent hospitalizations and lifelong alterations in lung function. This proposal will explore developmental, genetic and environmental interactions and identify biochemical markers to predict BPD development and severity, with the ultimate goal of designing new treatments to prevent BPD and improve long-term lung function in premature infants. n/a",Improving Prematurity-related Respiratory Outcomes at Vanderbilt (IMPROV),9172438,U01HL101456,[' '],NHLBI,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",U01,2014,197560,208750,-0.024004175480409992
"Automated retinopathy of prematurity classification using machine learning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to develop a web-based, semi-automated system for identifying severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) with ""plus disease,"" using an existing data set of retinal images collected from previous NIH-funded research studies. ROP is treatable if diagnosed early, yet continues to be a leading cause of childhood blindness throughout the world. Diagnosis and documentation of ophthalmoscopic findings in ROP are subjective and qualitative, and studies have found that there is often significant diagnostic variation, even when experts are shown the exact same clinical data. Computer-based image analysis and the application of machine learning techniques to feature extraction and image classification have potential to address many of these limitations. Recent advances in image processing have had led to sophisticated techniques for tracing vessel-like structures. Additionally, machine-learning techniques will enable us to leverage these existing annotated image databases to improve the performance of our algorithms for vessel segmentation and disease classification. Our overall hypothesis is that retinal vascular features may be quantified and used to assist clinicians in the diagnosis of ROP. These hypotheses will be tested using two Specific Aims: (1) Develop and evaluate semi-automated algorithms to segment retinal vessels and generate a set of retinal vessel-based features. (2) Develop computer-based decision support algorithms that best correlate with expert opinions. Overall, this project will build upon infrastructure developed from previous studies, create potential for improving the accuracy and consistency of clinical ROP diagnosis, provide a demonstration of computer-based decision support from image analysis during real-world medical care, and stimulate future research toward understanding the vascular features associated with severe ROP. This project will be performed by a multi-disciplinary team of investigators with expertise in ophthalmology, biomedical informatics, computer science, machine learning, and image processing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of childhood blindness in the United States and throughout the world, and current diagnostic and documentation methods are often subjective and qualitative. We propose to use existing data sets to develop a web- based, semi-automated system for identifying severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) with ""plus disease"" from retinal images.

"Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence  Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence Translation of biomedical research into practice depends in part on the production of quality systematic reviews that synthesize available evidence. Unfortunately, about 20% of reviews are never completed. Of those that reach fruition, the average time to completion may be 2.4 years, with a reported maximum of 9 years. A major bottleneck occurs when teammates screen studies. In the first step, they independently identify provisionally eligible studies by reading the same set of perhaps thousands of titles and abstracts. To date, researchers have used supervised machine learning (ML) methods in an attempt to automate identification of eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, finding nonrandomized (NR) studies for inclusion in systematic reviews has yet to be addressed. This is an important problem because RCTs may be unlikely or even unethical for some research questions. Hypotheses. It is broadly hypothesized that (a) methods based on natural language processing and ML can be used to automatically identify topically relevant studies with a mix of NR designs eligible for inclusion in systematic reviews; and (b) machine performance can consistently reach current human standards with respect to identifying eligible studies. Aims. This research has three aims: (1) Compare the language that biomedical researchers use to describe their NR study designs with existing relevant vocabularies. Develop complementary terminologies for overlooked NR study designs to improve coverage of important vocabularies. Develop and validate a standalone terminology to support librarians who add free-text terms to expert searches. (2) Develop and compare procedures based on natural language processing and supervised ML methods to identify provisionally eligible NR studies that are topically relevant from a set of citations, including titles, abstracts, and metadata. Use terms for NR study designs to improve classification. (3) Generalize procedures developed under Aims 1 and 2 to select topically relevant studies with a mix of designs for provisional inclusion in several types of systematic reviews. Use contextual information in segments of full texts tagged for location to enrich feature vectors. Methods. Reference standards will be built from studies in published Cochrane reviews. Features will be extracted from citations and regions of full texts. Additionally, feature vectors will be enriched with terms for designs that researchers use in combination with terms extracted from major vocabularies. Model performance will be compared with respect to several measures, including mean recall and precision, for 10-fold cross-validations and validations on held-out test sets. Significance. The proposed research is significant because it will help support translation of biomedical research to improve human health. Moreover, developing procedures to identify NR studies is essential for the expeditious translation of a very large body of research.  Translation of biomedical research helps to improve public health by delivering the best available evidence to clinicians. This process depends in part on the production of systematic reviews of research. Computerized procedures will be developed to reduce the labor associated with screening nonrandomized studies for inclusion in reviews.",Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence,8669161,R00LM010943,"['Address', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Health', 'Human', 'Language', 'Librarians', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reading', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computerized', 'design', 'improved', 'research to practice', 'screening', 'systematic review', 'vector']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2014,212994,570146095,-0.006856012965395258
"BIGDATA Small Project Structurization and Direct Search of Medical Image Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): IBM estimates that 30% of the entire data in the world is medical information. Medical images occupy a significant portion of medical records with approximately 100 million scans in US and growing every year. In addition, the data size from each scan steadfastly increases as the image resolution improves. These BigData are not structured and due to lack of standardized imaging protocols, they are highly heterogeneous with different spatial resolutions, contrasts, slice orientations, etc. In this project, we will deelop a technology to structure and search medical imaging information, which will make the past data available for education and evidence-based clinical decision-making. In this grant, we will focus on brain MRI, which comprises the largest portion of MRI data. The target community will be physicians who make decisions and the patients will be the ultimate beneficiaries. Currently, radiological image data are stored in clinical database called PACS. The image data in PACS are not structured. Consequently, once the diagnosis of a patient is completed, most of the data in PACS are currently discarded in the archive. Radiologists rely on their experience and education to reach medical decisions. This is a typical problem in medical practice that calls for objective evidence-based medicine. There are many ongoing attempts to structure the text fields of PACS, which include natural language processing of free-text radiological reports, clinical information, and diagnosis. In our approach, we propose to structure the image data, not text fields, to support direct search of images. Namely, physicians will submit an image of a new patient and search past images with similar anatomical phenotypes. Then, the clinical reports of the retrieved data will be compiled for a statistical report of the diagnosis and prognosis. We believe this image structuration is the key to ""unlock the vast amounts of information currently stored"" in PACS and use them for education and modern evidence-based medical decisions. The specific aims are; Objective 1: To develop and test the accuracy of high-throughput image structuration technologies Objective 2: To develop and test the image search engine Objective 3: Capacity Building Requirement: To develop prototype cloud system for data structuration / search services for research and educational purposes                  n/a",BIGDATA Small Project Structurization and Direct Search of Medical Image Data,8664845,R01EB017638,"['Archives', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Image', 'Information Systems', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'beneficiary', 'clinical decision-making', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'outcome forecast', 'prototype', 'radiologist']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,214609,807432003,-0.008889711838550411
"Mobile App for Diabetic Retinopathy Screening using Cellphone Retinal Camera     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this SBIR project, we present EyeApp, a smartphone-based end-to-end point-of- care diabetic retinopathy diagnostic device comprising of a smartphone-attachable retinal imaging camera and validated software application enabling fully-automated screening of diabetic retinopathy (DR). DR is the leading cause of new-onset blindness in working-age adults in the industrialized world today. Studies show that in 90% of the cases vision loss can be prevented if DR is diagnosed at an early stage.  Recommended annual screening is expected to significantly improve outcome for diabetic patients, but even in the developed world, majority of the diabetics do not regularly have the annual screening due to several limiting factors. To make things worse, the current cost of screening all diabetics to detect those with early DR is very high because: (a) most patients will have normal exams (thus, causing inefficient use of specialist's time), (b) retinal imaging equipment is very expensive, and (c) trained technicians must operate the imaging equipment. In this project we address these critical limitations by employing cellphone retinal camera attachment, the Ocular CellScope, developed by our collaborators at UCB/UCSF, which simply attaches to an iPhone, doesn't need a trained technician to operate, will obtain wide-field images, and will cost several orders of mag- nitude less than the current tabletop retinal imaging cameras. Diabetic patients can attach the camera to their smartphones and with some assistance (untrained friend, spouse, or nurse) obtain retinal video for each eye using an app residing on the same phone. This app guides the image capture to ensure that best quality frames are obtained, and also ensure all areas of the eye are imaged enabling wide-field imaging. EyeApp's validated algorithms output a near-instant DR screening recommendation score. EyeApp is con- ceptualized as a culmination of over three years of research and development at Eyenuk (on computerized DR screening) and at UCB/UCSF (on smartphone retinal camera) that has already produced functional prototypes of critical technology modules. This phase I project focusses on seamless integration of these proven modules (the camera hardware and the diagnostic software) via several novel ideas.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: EyeApp, a smartphone-based end-to-end point-of-care diabetic retinopathy diagnostic device, will truly enable diabetic retinopathy screening at massive scale, which is necessary and urgent - since the world diabetic population is estimated to be a staggering 371 million, and is projected to grow to over half a billion by 2030. EyeApp will operate in and end-to-end fashion, from retinal imaging to diagnostic screening, all without needing a trained operator. It will cost orders of magnitude less than conventional retinal cameras, and will simply attach to a smartphone, thus greatly reducing the cost and expanding the availability of screening to vast underserved population in the US and the world.            ",Mobile App for Diabetic Retinopathy Screening using Cellphone Retinal Camera,8782362,R43EY024848,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Back', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blindness', 'Chairperson', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Leadership', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Nurses', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Solid', 'Specialist', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cloud based', 'cluster computing', 'commercialization', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'experience', 'glucose monitor', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'member', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'professor', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'screening', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool']",NEI,"EYENUK, INC.",R43,2014,217002,1300000,0.0046782391564367315
"SCH: Proactive Health Monitoring Using Individualized Analysis of Tissue Elastic* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Existing studies suggest that tissue elasticity is possibly correlated with the aggressiveness of cancers. Based on results from deformable image registration, the proposed project investigates the possibility of tracking the organs movement subject to external forces and geometric constraints, thereby deducing patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters for proactive health monitoring. The objectives of this exploratory research project are (1) to develop a computational framework based on extensive studies of a large cohort of cancer patients, in order to accurately estimate patent-specific tissu elasticity using a coupled biomechanical simulation-optimization framework on a pair of medical images (possibly from ultrasound, mammography, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, or other imaging technologies); (2) to examine potential association between tissue elasticity in different regions with aggressiveness of know/diagnosed cancer in the corresponding regions; (3) to derive predictive models for cancer staging/grading based on recovered patient-specific tissue elasticity and other explanatory variables; (4) to design a health monitoring system based on individualized analysis of tissue elasticity for 'at-risk' groups  who are more likely to develop cancers. This proposal describes a truly ambitious effort and a bold vision that is built upon the investigators' prior scientific accomplishments and strong credentials to potentially transform existing practice to more proactive, preventive, evidence-based health monitoring for individuals at risk of developing cancers. This research is expected to make several major scientific advances. These include new algorithms for non-invasive, image-based techniques for automatic extraction of tissue elasticity parameters without force applications and/or force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new predictive models for cancer staging and grading based on patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters, and a health monitoring system for at-risk groups based on individual tissue elasticity along with other variables. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Other than health monitoring, the patient-specific tissue parameters can be incorporated into medical simulators to perform patient-specific surgical planning, compute desired force-feedback for tele-surgery, design and prototype medical devices, and conduct virtual surgical training.

"Using NLP to Extract Clinically Important Recommendations from Radiology Reports  Abstract Communication of clinically important follow-up recommendations when abnormalities are identified on imaging studies is prone to error. The absence of an automated system to identify and track radiology follow-up recommendations is an important barrier to ensuring timely follow-up of patients, especially for non-acute but potentially life threatening and unexpected findings. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system to extract clinically important recommendation information from free-text radiology reports. Each radiology report will be preprocessed at the structural, syntactic, and semantic level to generate features that will be used to extract the boundaries of sentences that include recommendation information as well as the details of reason for recommendation, requested imaging test, and recommendation time frame. We will use a large corpus of free-text radiology reports represented by a mixture of modalities (e.g., radiography, computed tomography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) from three different institutions. Using this dataset we will perform the following specific aims: Aim 1. Create a multi- institutional radiology report corpus annotated for clinically important recommendation information; Aim 2. Develop a novel NLP system to extract clinically important recommendations in radiology reports. The proposed research is innovative because it will generate a new text processing approach that can be used to flag reports visually and electronically so that separate workflow processes can be initiated to reduce the chance that necessary investigations or interventions suggested in the report are missed by clinicians. The proposed set of tools will be disseminated to the biomedical informatics community as open source tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Communication of recommendations for necessary investigations and interventions when abnormalities are identified on imaging studies is prone to error. When recommendations are not systematically identified and promptly communicated to referrers, poor patient outcomes can result. We propose to build natural language processing tools to automatically extract clinically important recommendation information from radiology reports.                ",Using NLP to Extract Clinically Important Recommendations from Radiology Reports,8635902,R21EB016872,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidental Findings', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Lung nodule', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Ultrasonography', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Washington', 'Writing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer care', 'care delivery', 'design', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'health care delivery', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'open source', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2014,257300,533302350,-0.007044039138826759
"Instrument to Co-register EEG and NIRS for Accurate Sleep Sorting     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     PROJECT SUMMARY Sleep disorders are highly prevalent and are associated with substantial adverse consequences including motor vehicle and other accidents, impaired cognition, impaired immune function, altered mood, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality. The gold standard test for assessing the physiology of sleep is the polysomnogram suffers from a number of well-recognized limitations. These limitations decrease the capacity of sleep researchers to make advances in understanding sleep and diminish the capacity of clinicians to detect and treat patients suffering from sleep disorders. (PSG). Currently employed PSG technology Our long-term goal is to address the shortcomings of current PSG methodology by developing a low cost, low for automated assessment of sleep physiology. We hypothesize that this would be possible by expanding the types of brain assessments carried out to include near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) where recent evidence suggests that the low frequency hemodynamic oscillation reflect sleep stage-related changes in brain function. NIRS also simultaneously provides cerebral oxygen saturation, heart rate and breathing rate estimates. In this application, we propose to design, build, and test power, low noise, ultra-miniaturized, wireless system a proof-of-principle prototype system combining diffuse optical spectroscopic, electrophysiological, and inertial . This system will have the form factor of an adhesive bandage which will disturb and limit subjects to a far lesser degree than traditional PSG systems. We will use supervised machine learning-based methods to explore NIRS features specific to sleep stages and clinically relevant events. Other innovations include recording inertial signals and incorporating adaptive signal processing in order to remove artifacts and improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR), and using commercial-off-the-shelf proximity sensor circuitry to support the NIRS front-end. measurement capabilities If successful, this project will lead to improved capacity to carry out sleep research and to detect and treat sleep disorders. The proposed methodology would test whether novel clinically relevant NIRS parameters can be explored enabling further understanding of sleep physiology. The miniaturization, low cost, and low power consumption of our new NIRS-based wireless system would pave the way for rapid adoption and deployment of these bandages for home-use in real-world settings. Given the high prevalence and substantial impairments associated with sleep disorders, this project has the potential to have a major positive impact on public health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Project Narrative A review carried out by the Institute of Medicine concluded that 50-70 million people in the United States suffer from a chronic disorder of sleep and wakefulness which diminishes their ability to function, adversely impacts their health, and decreases longevity. Current systems for objectively monitoring sleep physiology and diagnosing sleep disorders suffer from a number of widely-recognized shortcomings that limit the capacity of researchers to make advances in understanding sleep and sleep disorders and diminish the capacity of clinicians to detect and treat patients suffering from these conditions.

"Daily Immune Monitoring in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating condition characterized by profound, chronic fatigue that is not alleviated by rest, as well as pain, post-exertional malaise, and impairments in memory and concentration. ME/CFS affects over one million women in the United States, causing significant distress and loss of function in affected individuals and a significant financial burden on society Because the underlying pathophysiology of ME/CFS is not well-understood, there are no effective treatments developed specifically for the condition, and many patients are unsatisfied with existing treatment options. Previous research provides a strong case for inflammatory involvement in ME/CFS, though no immune factors have been consistently predictive of fatigue across studies. Conventional cross-sectional research approaches may not be sufficiently sensitive for identifying ME/CFS biomarkers in cases of low-level or atypical inflammation. We have observed that women with ME/CFS demonstrate considerable day-to-day variability in their fatigue severity, and this variability may reflect rapid shifts in underlying disease mechanisms. By viewing the daily fatigue variability as an important signal, and collecting blood samples daily, we have identified a small set of serum cytokines that are strongly correlated with changes in ME/CFS 1fatigue. In this proposed study, we plan to confirm our preliminary findings of immune-fatigue relationships in a larger sample. We will collect blood samples for 25 consecutive days in 70 women with ME/CFS, as well as 20 healthy controls and 20 active fatigue controls (individuals with hypothyroidism). Blood samples will be analyzed for 51 different immune factors associated with inflammation. In addition, participants will submit daily reports of fatigue severity on handheld computers. By analyzing fatigue scores and cytokine concentrations longitudinally, we can identify cytokines that ""track"" day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. This approach will allow us to develop a physiological profile that distinguishes high fatigue days from low fatigue days, providing important information about ME/CFS mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will develop a physiological model that uses serum cytokine levels to accurately predict day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. In Aim 2, we will define important ME/CFS subgroups based on cytokine-fatigue relationships. In Aim 3, we will develop a temporal pathway between immune factors and fatigue that identifies early drivers of fatigue. Additionally, we will develop a specimen bank of blood samples that can be made available to other interested researchers. Intensive longitudinal immune monitoring is a unique approach to understanding ME/CFS pathophysiology. Biomarkers revealed by this research will serve as tools in the development of ME/CFS diagnostic tests, and will provide excellent targets for developing improved therapies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a debilitating and poorly understood condition that affects over one million women in the United States. Our goal with this project is to identify biological targets that will allow better treatments for chronic fatigue to e developed. Our unique approach for discovering biomarkers involves monitoring fatigue and immune factor concentrations on a daily basis. Immune factors that closely ""track"" day-to-day changes in fatigue severity are likely involved in the disorder and are excellent targets for treatment.                ",Daily Immune Monitoring in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,8687349,R01AI107655,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Bed rest', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Screening', 'Blood specimen', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Eotaxin', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Flare', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Handheld Computers', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Hypothyroidism', 'Immune', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intercellular adhesion molecule 1', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Leptin', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaise', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Stress', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Societies', 'Specimen', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Transforming Growth Factor alpha', 'United States', 'Woman', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'loss of function', 'men', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'resistin', 'tool']",NIAID,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,269011,560644462,-0.02657152912142424
"Development and Dissemination of MuscleMiner: An Imaging Informatics Tool for Mus     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Image evaluation of skeletal muscle biopsies is a procedure essential to research and clinical practice. Although widely used, several major limitations exist with respect to current muscle image morphometric measurement, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, retrieval, and mining procedures: 1) Although traditional morphometric parameters, such as cross-sectional area (CSA) and minimum Feret diameter, etc., serve as critical indicators for assessing muscle function, current measurements are still largely based on manual or semi-automated methods, leading to significant labor costs with large potential inter-observer variability. 2) The current archiving of muscle images is still mainy based on outdated tools such as Excel spreadsheets and computer file folders. Given a new muscle image, it is almost impossible to quickly cross-compare, visualize, query, search, and retrieve previous cases exhibiting similar image contents with comparable morphometric measures, for the purpose of either discovering novel biological co-correlations at benchside, or providing personalized diagnosis and prognosis at bedside. 3) Although a typical muscle image often contains millions of data points (pixels), in clinical practice, doctors often condense this rich information into one or two diagnostic labels and discard the rest. Novel image markers, which are not always apparent through visual inspections or not manually quantifiable, but potentially represent critical diagnostic and prognostic values for precision medicine, have not been rigorously examined. Similarly, in basic science research, only a very limited number of known measures (e.g., CSA) are considered. Some non-traditional measures, such as myofiber shapes that hold the potential to serve as new indicators of muscle functions, are not fully investigated. 4) Current muscle image analysis and searching functions are fairly low throughput. As a frontier research area, Cloud computing can handle big image data in a distributed manner by providing high-throughput computational power. However, its application to muscle images has never been explored. MuscleMiner will provide a complete suite of tools for automated image morphometric measurements, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, content-based image retrieval, bioinformatics image mining, and Cloud computing. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) Develop the automated morphometric measurement unit, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) unit, and the image archiving and visualization unit. 2) Develop the advanced bioinformatics image mining unit to assist in the rapid discovery and validation of new image markers. 3) Develop the Cloud computing unit to enable big image data processing and searching functions. Disseminate this freely available, Cloud-enabled imaging informatics system to muscle research community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose to develop and disseminate an advanced Cloud-enabled imaging informatics tool - MuscleMiner. MuscleMiner will provide a complete suite of tools for automated image morphometric measurements, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, content-based image retrieval, and bioinformatics image mining. The goal of MuscleMiner is to offer a freely available and powerful tool to help all clinician and basic scienc muscle researchers in their daily work. Beyond fast, objective, reproducible, and automated morphometric measurements, the impact of MuscleMiner will be multiplied by laboratories using the CBIR and visualization units (Aim 1), bioinformatics image mining unit (Aim 2), and Cloud-computing unit (Aim 3) to deeply mine and fully utilize the rich information embedded in large collections of muscle images.            ",Development and Dissemination of MuscleMiner: An Imaging Informatics Tool for Mus,8761698,R01AR065479,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Cells', 'Client', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Fascicle', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mus', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Shapes', 'Slide', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'System', 'Technology', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical practice', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'frontier', 'image archival system', 'image visualization', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'skeletal', 'tool', 'wasting']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2014,314327,188894159,-0.006706519050154674
"Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in the laboratory sciences have led to the discovery of a large number of candidate biomarkers, which hold great potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. At this time, an important research bottleneck is the lack of well-developed statistical methods for effectively using these candidate biomarkers to enhance clinical practice. It is our goal to develop new tools to select, combine, and evaluate biomarkers for disease classification and treatment selection. Classification markers predict an individual's disease outcome and are useful for the detection of diseases at an early stage when a treatment is most effective. Research proposed in Aim 1 seeks to select and combine markers to improve the classification performance in disease screening and diagnosis. Treatment selection markers predict a patient's response to different therapies and allow for the selection of a therapy that has the best predicted outcome. Aim 2 seeks to develop marker-based treatment selection rules to maximize the benefit to the patient population. A biomarker that is useful for guiding treatment decision to the general population will have different values to different patients due to individual differences in their response to treatment and in their tolerance of the disease harm and treatment cost. Aim 3 seeks to develop a new graphical tool to customize the evaluation of a biomarker for aiding treatment decision based on personal characteristics.  Our statistical methods will apply broadly to general medical fields. In particulr, we will apply these methods to analyze several cancer studies including (1) biomarker studies for prostate cancer and pan- creatic cancer from the Early Detection and Research Network; (2) the Women's Health Initiative breast cancer genome-wide association study; and (3) the Oncotype-Dx breast cancer study from the Southwest Oncology Group. Programs and algorithms developed in this proposal will be made available to public.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The focus of this proposal is to develop novel statistical methods for the design and analysis of biomarker studies. In particular, the proposed methods will develop marker combinations to improve disease diagnosis, develop treatment selection rules to cost-effectively reduce population disease burden, and help patients and clinicians make informed decisions about the use of medical tests in clinical practices.            ",Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers,8660307,R01GM106177,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer genome', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2014,324364,758431960,-0.060081406639876905
"3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical assessment of optic nerve swelling is limited by the subjective ophthalmoscopic evaluation by experts in order to diagnose and differentiate the cause of the optic disc edema. The long-term goal of our research effort is to develop automated 3D image-analysis approaches for the identification of an optimal set of 3D parameters to quantify the severity of optic nerve edema over time and to help differentiate the underlying cause. The overall objective in this application is to develop strategies, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve swelling in patients diagnosed with papilledema and to ascertain morphological features that differentiate papilledema from other disorders causing optic nerve edema. The central hypothesis is that information about volumetric and shape parameters obtainable from 3D image analysis techniques will improve the ability to accurately assess the severity and cause of optic disc edema over the existing subjective ophthalmoscopic assessment of optic nerve swelling using the Fris¿n scale or current 2D OCT parameters. The rationale for the proposed research is that having such 3D parameters will dramatically improve the way optic disc swelling is assessed. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1. Develop and evaluate the methodology for computing novel volumetric and shape parameters of a swollen optic nerve head from SD-OCT. This will be completed by refining and evaluating our novel 3D graph-based segmentation algorithms in SD-OCT volumes of patients with optic disc swelling. 2. Identify SD-OCT parameters that optimally correlate with clinical measurements of severity in patients with papilledema and develop a continuous severity scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to relate SD-OCT parameters to expert-defined Fris¿n scale grades (a fundus-based measure of severity). It is anticipated that volumetric 3D parameters will more closely correlate with clinical measures than 2D parameters and will provide a continuous severity scale. 3. Identify SD-OCT parameters that differentiate papilledema from other causes of optic disc swelling (or apparent optic disc swelling, as in pseudopapilledema) and develop a corresponding predictive classifier. Our working hypothesis is that 3D shape parameters, especially those near Bruch's membrane opening, will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach is innovative because the 3D image-analysis methodology developed by the applicants enables novel determination of 3D volumetric and shape parameters and represents a significant improvement over the status quo of using qualitative image information and 2D OCT image information for assessing optic disc swelling. The proposed research is significant because it will help to establish a much-needed alternative and more objective method by which to assess the severity and cause of optic disc swelling.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of novel spectral-domain optical coherence tomography parameters for assessing the severity and cause of optic nerve edema is expected to enable more efficient and effective diagnosis and management strategies of patients with such swelling. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to reduce the burdens of disability and is particularly relevant to the part of NEI's mission regarding understanding blinding eye diseases and preserving sight.                ",3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema,8652462,R01EY023279,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Papilledema', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Swelling', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'digital', 'disability burden', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'public health relevance']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2014,332955,193405667,0.005702179153097633
"Multimodal image registration by proxy image synthesis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Image registration is a fundamentally important capability in modern neuroscience and clinical medicine. Normalization in functional imaging studies, studies of shape changes in growth, aging, and disease, overlaying surgical plans on intraoperative images, and geometric distortion correction are examples of important applications of image registration. There are dozens of needs for registration in both intrasubject and intersubject applications as well. Therefore, any improvement in image registration performance will have an immediate impact on the scientific and clinical communities. Despite numerous advances in image reconstruction algorithms, the use of multiple modalities (or tissue contrasts) to carry out image registration is a virtually untapped area. The vastly dominant framework is to register a single image of the subject to another single image of the target, and if multiple images are available of either subject or target, they are registered by using the transformation derived from the single image registration. The proposed research will develop, evaluate, and validate a very simply explained but quite radical idea for multi-modal registration. The basic idea is to synthesize a ""proxy"" image from the subject image that has the same tissue contrast and intensity range as the target image and then use a conventional metric such as sum-of-square difference to carry out the registration between the subject proxy and target. Preliminary results demonstrate significant benefits in this approach. In the grant we will: 1) Optimize ""proxy"" multimodal image registration by exploring its theoretical justification as well a key parameters of the overall approach; 2) Apply ""proxy"" multimodal image registration to three key applications in neuroscience in order to validate the method and develop principles of best practice; and 3) Write open source software to carry out image synthesis, similarity computation, and rigid and deformable registration using the ""proxy"" image concept. Both the software to synthesize images for use in a user's favorite image registration method as well as software to carry out the entire ""proxy"" registration process in an optimized way will be made publicly available as open source computer code. The results of this research will lead to a new era in image registration by changing the way researchers and practitioners acquire and use data for neuroscientific studies and clinical medicine.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medical image registration is a method used throughout clinical medicine and medical research and it is vital to the success of many treatments and therapies and for answering a myriad of important scientific questions. This research will permit better alignment by devising and testing a new similarity criterion for multimodal images using the first significantly new approach in over a decade. The result will be better alignment of these images, which will enable better clinical diagnosis and prognosis and more significant research discoveries.

"Improving Prematurity-related Respiratory Outcomes at Vanderbilt (IMPROV)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease that impacts the pulmonary and overall health of more than 10,000 infants in the US each year. The long-term objective of this Clinical Research Center (CRC) is translation of biochemical, genetic and bioinformatics research into innovative interventions that improve outcomes of extremely preterm infants at risk for long- term pulmonary morbidity. Our proposal focuses specifically on the urea cycle-nitric oxide (UC-NO) and glutathione (GSH) pathways as pivotal and interrelated mechanisms in the response of the developing lung to the extrauterine environment. Overall hypotheses: (1) Biochemical immaturity and functional genetic variation in the UC-NO and GSH pathways modulate the BPD phenotype spectrum; (2) The duration and degree of NO insufficiency and free radical excess predicts BPD severity and correlates with pulmonary morbidity after NICU discharge. To investigate our hypothesis, our CRC will enroll 250 infants with birthweights 510-1250 grams and follow the survivors through 1 year of life. Our hypothesis invokes an immature hepatic and gut synthetic capacity to make citrulline and GSH, functional genetic variations in the UC-NO and GSH pathways, nutritional deficiencies and the physiologic and environmental stress of preterm birth. The resultant NO deficiency and free radical excess alters pulmonary vascular and alveolar development. Our biomarker discovery concept includes (a) collection of plasma, urine, red blood cells, DNA and tracheal aspirates for measurements of NO and GSH precursor sufficiency, production of NO metabolites and GSH, functional genetic variants in these pathways, and biomarkers of in vivo oxidative stress and (b) validation of these biomarkers for diagnosis and long term prognosis of patients with BPD. A bioinformatics approach using machine learning and predictive modeling has been developed for respiratory phenotyping and risk stratification at 36 weeks and 40 weeks postmenstrual age and at 12 months after hospital discharge. Accomplishment of these goals will promote novel clinical trials design to test new therapies to prevent BPD and improve long term pulmonary health of infants born preterm. (End of Abstract)      RELEVANCE: Each year in the US, more than 10,000 premature infants develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease associated with prolonged and recurrent hospitalizations and lifelong alterations in lung function.

"Automated Web-Based Behavioral Diagnostics of Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade. A critical goal of Alzheimer's disease research is to improve current methods of diagnosis so that patients can be identified sooner and, therefore, obtain greater advantage from available therapies. The major goal of this project is to develop and validate an automated, web-based method for early diagnosis of cognitive decline and memory loss. We will build on current research that has demonstrated a clear link between performance on the Visual Paired- Comparison Task (VPC) and diagnosis of MCI, and we will extend the impact of this finding by developing a suite of software tools and analysis methods that will improve the accuracy and extend the accessibility of cognitive diagnostics with a web-based VPC task that can be widely deployed. Although the VPC task is promising as a diagnostic aid, clinical application is severely limited by the need to use an eye tracker to precisely monitor subjects' eye movements. Unfortunately, eye trackers are expensive, require trained personnel, and are not widely available. However, our preliminary findings show that it is possible to produce picture examination behavior that is similar to eye-movements, using modified versions of the VPC task that could be administered by anyone, on any computer with an internet connection. In addition, powerful machine learning techniques from computer science can help accurately analyze and diagnose the resulting behavior. An important contribution from this work will be the possibility of predicting oncoming cognitive decline in MCI patients sooner than is now possible, that is, at a time when the nervous system is less compromised and more likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. In support of this objective, we propose three aims: 1) Develop and investigate appropriate representation of eye movement characteristics and corresponding machine learning-based classification techniques for effective identification of the patient status, 2) Develop and validate a web-based version of the VPC task, and 3) explore the feasibility of our task as an automatic screening instrument for the general elderly population. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to dramatically alter the current practice of clinical translational research as well as the current methods used for diagnosing cognitive deficits. This would enable thousands and potentially millions of patients and potential research subjects to take the test as part of their routine checkup, requiring nothing more than a computer with an internet connection.

"Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build and test a dynamic vascular optical tomographic imaging (DVOTI) system that can be used to detect and monitor peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is estimated to affect approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. However, the disease is considerably under-diagnosed, since most patients are asymptomatic and no single reliable screening modality has been established. Most of the undiagnosed and untreated patients are diabetics. They commonly suffer from peripheral neuropathy and hence do not sense and report symptoms (such as pain) that are early signs of the disease. Consequently more than 60% (~65,000 per year) of all lower extremity amputations in the United States are performed in diabetic patients with PAD. With the number of diabetic patients expected to triple and reach almost 100 million by 2050, the problems related to undiagnosed PAD will only rise in the years to come  The most widely used diagnostic test for PAD, determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in conjunction with pulse-volume recordings (PVR), is known to be unreliable for diabetics. And even in non- diabetics, ABI with PVR and all other existing diagnostic tests (such as Duplex Ultrasound or Magnetic resonance angiography), only provides accurate information about proximal occlusions in major arteries of the leg. However, none of these tests assess the distal perfusion of the foot where most complications, such as ulcers and gangrene, typically occur. Monitoring the success of surgical interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, suffers from the same shortcomings, as physicians are limited to the same suite of tests that are inadequate to assess the perfusion of the foot.  Dynamic VOTI promises to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic and monitoring techniques and has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift concerning how vascular diseases are assessed. In preliminary studies we have shown that DVOTI can provide three-dimensional time-series images that provide valuable information about the perfusion of the vascular bed in feet of PAD patients. The near-infrared light used in the instrument has no adverse health effects and measurements can be repeated frequently to monitor post interventional progress. Therefore, we believe that DVOTI will prove to be a safe and accurate method to diagnose and monitor PAD in non-diabetic and diabetic patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build and test a novel optical imaging system that will allow for the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. The disease is considerably under-diagnosed, especially in diabetic patients, the elderly, and patients with kidney disease. The system will address an unmet need to directly assess the degree of blood perfusion in the feet, where most PAD-related complications occur, which lead to over 65,000 amputations each year.",Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease,8724239,R01HL115336,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Angioplasty', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Gangrene', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preventive', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ulcer', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'blood perfusion', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'foot', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'light emission', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optical imaging', 'post intervention', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'success', 'theories', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'vascular bed']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2014,341074,558628098,-3.723330983286885e-05
"Hand Sensorimotor Function and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The median nerve is susceptible to compression in the wrist, leading to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is the most common compression neuropathy and have an immense impact on national health care, worker productivity, and quality of life. Despite its high prevalence and public health cost, our understanding of CTS is limited, and the management of CTS awaits improvement. The central notion of this project is that hand sensorimotor function is sensitive to peripheral median neuropathy and that the central nervous system is affected by CTS, causing the associated sensorimotor deficit. We will investigate this notion with quantifiable sensorimotor data from novel biomechanical and neurophysiological studies. This project has three aims consisting of biomechanical, neurophysiological and translational research. The first aim is to investigate CTS-induced pathokinematic and pathokinetic performance using dexterous manual tasks of thumb opposition, reach-to-pinch, precision grip, and finger pressing. The second aim is to investigate the neurophysiological implications of chronic peripheral neuropathy (i.e., CTS) on the central nervous system by evaluating corticomuscular coupling and stretch reflex. The third aim is to identify novel biomechanical and neurophysiological markers for CTS cases using machine learning and classification algorithms. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of CTS and aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder. More generally, CTS as a chronic neuropathy serves as an effective model to study sensorimotor mechanisms of the peripheral and central nervous systems. In addition, the methodology developed in this project is applicable to other neuromuscular disorders.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly. One of the distinct consequences of carpal tunnel syndrome is that patients experience inexplicable dropping of objects and clumsiness while performing simple daily tasks. In this project, we propose to study the sensorimotor deficit using novel biomechanical and neurophysiological experiments. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and manifestations of carpal tunnel syndrome. This project is clinically translational to aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder.

"A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI NeuroEnabling Technologies, Inc. RESEARCH & RELATED Other Project Information 7. PROJECT SUMMARY Of the approximately 10 million people in the US living with paralysis, 15,000 are the result of spinal cord injury each year. The first year of care can range from $322,000-$986,000, with lifetime costs of $1.4-4M for someone injured at 25 years of age. In addition to potentially devastating sensorimotor disturbances, there is a huge financial cost, estimated to be $13.55B in medical care, therapy, and lost productivity nationwide. Until very recently, the recovery from spinal cord injury (SCI) was bleak, with little hope of restoring motor function. To address this we have demonstrated that the physiological state of the spinal circuitry of rats and cats can be modulated with epidural stimulation to generate voluntary limb motor function over a range of speeds, loads, and directions, a finding we have extended to humans. Three years post-injury, a motor complete spinal cord injured human subject was implanted with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord. In less than one month after implantation, the subject could stand independently, and after 7 months of daily epidural stimulation and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of epidural stimulation, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of epidural stimulation. We will advance these discoveries with the use of non-invasive stimulation of the lumbosacral cord to improve lower limb function following SCI. Central to this proposal is our discovery of a painless electrical multi-channel (stimulation of multiple parts of the spinal cord) theranostic tool that can be applied to the surface of the skin, termed transcutaneous spinal cord electrical stimulation (TESCS), bypassing the need for a surgically-implanted electrode array. In the first phase of this proposal we will demonstrate proof-of-principle that stimulation of the lumbosacral spinal cord can assess spared spinal motor function by: 1) Testing responses to transcutaneous electrical stimulation in subjects with spinal cord injury; and 2) defining the operational parameters of electrical stimulation that that are most effective using a machine-learning protocol, and 3) produce a multi-channel commercial prototype. This commercial product will undergo testing similar to the proof-of- principle device. This device will then be tested in subjects with cervicothoracic spinal cord injury and evaluated with a machine-learning protocol. This Phase I proposal will deliver a device that can painlessly and non-invasively aid in the assessment and recovery of SCI by delivering a specific electrical stimulation paradigm to the lumbosacral cord that improves use of the lower limbs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI NeuroEnabling Technologies, Inc. PROJECT NARRATIVE It now seems possible to apply three interventions: transcutaneous stimulation, administration of pharmacological agents, and motor training, to assess and enable the excitability of spared neural circuits in humans with a thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI), thus enabling these individuals to regain use of their legs. This enabling effect is similar to that observed with improved postura and locomotor function after a mid-thoracic SCI in which epidural stimulation was used. We will build and demonstrate a multi-channel transcutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation theranostic tool that we propose will allow assessment and enabling of lower limb function following a cervicothoracic spinal cord injury.

"Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Designing an efficient Huntington's disease (HD) early intervention clinical trial for individuals who have an expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene requires identifying and combining clinical, biological, cognitive, and brain imaging markers to accurately distinguish among subjects who will have a diagnosis during a given intervention period and those who will not, and to track early changes in the disease course. The goal of this project is to identify sensitive biomarkers for HD risk stratification, indexing disease progression, and developing clinical trial endpoints. The proposal directly adheres to ""2P's"" of the NIH New Strategic Vision of the ""4P's"" of Medicine: they will offer promising ways to predict when the disease will develop; and increase the capacity to personalize early intervention based on the informative patient-specific markers our models identify. Combining biomarkers to predict HD onset and progression is an essential step in a continuum of research for development of disease-modifying therapies. Composite markers and their risk profiles created from our model will offer quantitative way to monitor and compare potential interventions. Evidence collected from these comparisons will advance the development of efficacy studies in premanifest HD, where neuroprotective treatments would be most beneficial. We develop and apply a series of cutting-edge statistical learning methods based on support vector machine (SVM), variable selection, and dimension reduction to achieve these goals. These modern statistical methods designed for correlated big data have quickly emerged as among the most successful tools for hypothesis generation, classification and prediction in biomedical studies. However, they have not been introduced to HD biomarker research. In aim 1, using counting process, we propose SVM to handle time-to-event outcomes (e.g., time-to-HD-diagnosis) to combine markers into risk scores to discriminate subjects who will experience HD onset in the immediate future from those who will not,  based on their personalized features. Although SVM is well studied for binary outcomes, it is far less explored for time-to-event outcomes. We fill this gap in knowledge. In aim 2, we propose new learning methods for longitudinal outcomes to combine markers that modify the course of HD signs to monitor disease process and distinguish subjects with rapid progression from those with slower progression. In aim 3, we propose to use novel and robust performance measures to compare derived combined markers with existing disease indices and key markers. These aims will fundamentally advance our understanding of markers linked to HD onset and progression. The creation of statistical models for composite markers and risk profiles is especially useful in: (1) offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare potential interventions, and (2) improving power of efficacy studies targeted at premanifest individuals by narrowing the predictive interval which leads to future clinical trials that can be made shorter with fewer subjects. Finally, our improved predictions of HD onset and progression will provide more informative genetic counseling sessions for pre-symptomatic subjects at risk of HD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of Huntington's disease (HD) research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay onset or slow disease progression, and to provide different treatment regimens at each disease stage. To meet this goal, this proposal develops and applies a series of advanced statistical approaches to rank and combine clinical, behavioral, and brain imaging markers to predict HD diagnosis in premanifest subjects during a given time period and to measure disease progression. The creation of model for composite markers and risk profiles is useful in offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare interventions and powering clinical trials for premanifest HD individuals.            ",Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.,8721037,U01NS082062,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'CAG repeat', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Early intervention trials', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic screening method', 'Goals', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'affection', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'human Huntingtin protein', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'tool']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2014,359539,558628098,-0.022449068828103984
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into the causes, pathogenesis, and natural history of DILI. The ongoing Retrospective study has collected 109 DNA samples from subjects with liver injury attributed to one of 8 drugs. In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and outcomes of drug induced liver injury via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients into the ongoing DILIN Prospective and Retrospective studies. The collection of early blood and urine samples from well-characterized DILI patients will allow for innovative studies of patient, drug and environmental risk factors. Further development of a computerized diagnostic instrument and expansion of the LiverTox website is also planned which will provide doctors, researchers, and the general public an authoritative and up-to-date resource that can help accelerate DILI research in the US and abroad.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013,8717634,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anabolic steroids', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Ancillary Study', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Budesonide', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Expert Opinion', 'Floxacillin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Histopathology', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Injury to Liver', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular', 'Monograph', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Valproic Acid', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'chemical property', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'elastography', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'screening', 'transcriptomics', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2014,371508,641965656,-0.017398465194651654
"Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Applications  Abstract In this small business innovations research (SBIR) project we present EyeArt, a retinal image analysis tool for automated diabetic retinopathy (DR) screenings with high diag- nostic efficacy. With its interface to EyePACS, a license-free, scalable telemedicine plat- form, EyeArt will aid the expansion of DR screening and help bridge the exponentially growing disparity between the number of diabetic patients and the number of eye-care providers. Research suggests that the Latino population in general are genetically predisposed to develop diabetes. Their vulnerability to vision loss due to diabetic retinopathy is further compounded by factors such as lack of access to ophthalmology clinicians, lack of in- surance, and lack of education. According to the Department of Health Services (DHS) in Los Angeles County (LAC) the situation for diabetics is particularly grim, with current wait times upwards of 6-9 months for retinal examinations for retinopathy screening. This can lead to treatment delays and progression towards irreversible vision loss. To help reduce risk of vision loss in this diabetic population, we propose to use advanced image analysis algorithms in conjunction with existing telemedicine initiatives to enable faster screening, allow reprioritization of ophthalmologist appointments, and aid in triage of high-risk patients. Our phase I prototype automatic DR screening tool has already shown great potential by beating current academic and commercial DR screening ap- proaches on large public retinal datasets. Going forward, we will build on our approach and further develop innovative, customized algorithms for critical low-level image pro- cessing steps, while leveraging on recent advances in computer vision, and machine learning areas for high-level, inference steps to produce a clinical grade DR screening tool. Our lesion localization and screening engine will be functionally integrated with EyePACS to further drive the expansion of screening, particularly benefiting under- resourced screening programs like the LAC-DHS safety net and its large Hispanic dia- betic population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: EyeArt - an automated retinal image analysis tool will help in triaging patients in need of expert care and thus reduce the cost of diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening, while leading to an expansion of screening in primary care centers through its easily accessible telemedicine interface. This increased access to DR care will help prevent vision loss due to diabetes complications in vulnerable disparity populations such as Latinos who do not get screened due to socio-economic factors. To make an immediate impact we are collaborating with Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LAC-DHS) to deploy our system, following clinical validation, in their under-resourced safety net teleretinal screening setup whic caters to large disparity populations of LA County.            ",Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Applications,8740363,R44EB013585,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Background Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Blindness', 'California', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Color', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consult', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Economic Factors', 'Economically Deprived Population', 'Education', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Faculty', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Hispanics', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Insurance', 'International', 'Latino', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Licensing', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'ROC Curve', 'Reader', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical care', 'cloud based', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'experience', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'safety net', 'screening', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIBIB,"EYENUK, INC.",R44,2014,394542,1300000,-0.003376485519685827
"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation  SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Heart transplant (Tx) surgery is a well-established life-saving procedure, but is associated with post- interventional risks such as acute cardiac rejection (ACR) which is one of the leading causes of death in the first year after transplant. Beyond the first year, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the single greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality. Monitoring the patient for post-transplant events is thus paramount. The standard monitoring strategy, however, relies on frequent (12-16 monitoring nodes during year 1 alone) invasive and costly procedures including endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) and catheter angiography. Since EMB and catheter angiography have limited sensitivity due to sampling errors (ACR) or the diffuse nature of the disease (CAV), a reliable non-invasive alternative for the early detection of ACR and CAV would be desirable to reduce the need for invasive procedures, improve sensitivity, and reduce cost. We have recently developed and applied cardiac MRI techniques for the non-invasive assessment of myocardial edema (T2-mapping), diffuse fibrosis (pre- and post-contrast T1-mapping), myocardial velocities (tissue phase mapping), and microvascular quantitative perfusion. We have shown that these techniques can identify distinct regional structural and functional alterations in the heart that correlate with the status of the allograft. Based on these findings, a detailed cost-effective analysis using Markov modeling and decision tree analysis has demonstrated that cardiac MR has tremendous potential to reduce monitoring costs by 40-50% during the first year after Tx alone. This proposal builds on these promising findings and our aim is to develop an new 15-minute structure-function cardiac MRI protocol for the improved detection regional abnormalities associated with ACR (edema, fibrosis, dysfunction) and CAV (perfusion, dysfunction). Integration of MRI with echocardiography and intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) will provide unique multi-modality assessment of the allograft. The application in a longitudinal clinical study coupled with state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis will allow redefining the most effective post-Tx mixed monitoring strategy. The aim is to to help clinicians identify the optimal mixed monitoring strategy, i.e. the optimal combination of multi-modality imaging (structure-function MRI, echo, IVUS) and invasive procedures (EMB, catheter angiography) which provide best outcome (quality adjusted life days) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop a multi-modality imaging protocol for the non-invasive characterization of tissue and function of the left and right heart in patients after heart transplantation. Our aim is to develop a new non- invasive 15 minute diagnostic test in order to provide a previously unattainable quantitative characterization of myocardial structure-function deficits in cardiac transplant patients. The application in a longitudinal clinial study coupled with cost-effectiveness analysis and decision tree modeling will allow to improve current monitoring strategies by combining cardiac MRI, echocardiography, intravascular ultrasound and invasive tests (biopsy, catheter angiography) to provide the best outcome (quality of life days, mortality) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient.            ",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,8630169,R01HL117888,"['Acute', 'Allografting', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling Errors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'base', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'extracellular', 'follow-up', 'heart allograft', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'two-arm study']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2014,467351,367414121,0.011478756891834
"Noninvasive Assessment of Neuromuscular Disease using Electrical Impedance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuromuscular disorders include a wide group of conditions ranging from relatively mild focal problems, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, to severe, generalized diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Current methods for evaluating these disorders remain limited to a variety of tests and procedures that are either invasive or remarkably qualitative in nature. One newer technique, electrical impedance myography (EIM), offers the prospect of obtaining quantitative data on muscle condition painlessly and non-invasively. However, no commercial devices specifically tailored for EIM use exist, with nearly all previous EIM work relying upon off-the-shelf bioimpedance devices designed for ""whole-body"" rather than single-muscle assessment. In Phase 1 of this SBIR, Convergence Medical Devices, Inc (CMD) developed an initial prototype system to test proof-of-principle innovative concepts in circuit design and data acquisition to provide highly sensitive and accurate data at an extended frequency range (out to 10 MHz) and over multiple angles relative to the major muscle fiber direction. This work was followed by supplemental work that produced the first hand-held device with robust electronics capable of similar measurements with a detachable, interchangeable electrode array. In this 3-year Phase 2 SBIR, CMD proposes to further refine that technology so as to assist in disease diagnosis and for following disease progression, with a specific focus on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In Aim 1 of the proposed grant, testing of multiple electrode array designs will be performed on a group of normal subjects and those with ALS to determine which electrode array designs offer the greatest reproducibility and ability to discriminate healthy from diseased individuals. In Aim 2, the device and the 3 ""best"" array designs identified in Aim 1 will be tested in 30 ALS patients, 30 patients with syndromes mimicking ALS (e.g., polyradiculopathy and motor-predominant neuropathy), and 30 subjects with suspected/possible ALS to determine the single best array design for diagnosis and to determine its sensitivity and specificity. This study will take place at CMD and four external sites and will be managed by the Northeast ALS trials Consortium (NEALS), the premier organization for overseeing clinical trials in ALS. In Aim 3, the 30 suspected/possible ALS patients recruited in SA2 and 30 additional suspected/possible ALS patients will be assessed monthly using EIM and the 3 arrays identified in SA1. All subjects will also undergo standard measurements of disease progression including handheld dynamometry, ALS Functional Rating Scale, and spirometry. The best array design for assessing disease progression will be identified and compared to conventional markers of disease progression to determine EIM's sensitivity to disease status. Thus, at the conclusion of this research program, we anticipate having developed and vigorously tested an EIM device and associated electrode designs that together will serve as a powerful new diagnostic and monitoring tool for neuromuscular disease.          The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone. In this study, Convergence Medical Devices, in collaboration with neurologists at several medical centers, will develop and test a new device based on the concept of electrical impedance myography, a technique that offers the promise of rapid and accurate disease assessment. With the completion of this study, a new, painless tool will be developed and studied that will assist in individual patient care and will speed drug testing in clinical trials in diseases ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and muscular dystrophy to radiculopathy and polyneuropathy.

"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will make it possible for a wide community of researchers who collect and analyze medical imaging data to take advantage of a new class of computer algorithms that very accurately label and measure anatomical structures and pathological formations in medical images. By offering more accurate image-derived measurements, the project promises to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, reduce the costs of biomedical re- search studies and pharmaceutical trials, and accelerate scientific discovery.",Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation,8761531,R01EB017255,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Build-it', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'International', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Myocardium', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aortic valve', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'research study', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2014,611476,593605914,-0.0039083035635572305
"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We will use a novel statistical approach to develop and validate the models.            ",Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler,8695570,R01NS082304,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anterior', 'Anterior Horn Cells', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Natural History', 'Neuraxis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Riluzole', 'Spinal', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'spinal tract', 'treatment trial']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2014,616625,641965656,-0.014272865804155831
"High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before a heart attack, and predict risk in millions of patients annually. This is currently limited by the need fo visual interpretation, which is highly variable and depends on the physician's experience. The long-term objective of this program is to improve the interpretation of this widely used heart imaging technique-achieving higher accuracy for disease detection than it is possible by the best attainable visual analysis. This proposal builds on our prior work in conventional myocardial MPS, and focuses on fast, low-radiation MPS imaging (fast-MPS) obtained by new high-efficiency scanners. Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS. The algorithms will include better heart muscle detection by training with correlated anatomical data and a novel approach for mapping the probability of abnormal perfusion for each location of the heart muscle; 2) enhance the diagnosis of heart disease from fast-MPS by machine- learning algorithms that integrate clinical data, stress test parameters, and quantitative image features; 3) demonstrate the clinical utility of the new algorithms applied to automatic canceling of the rest portion of the MPS scan, when not needed. The new system will be more accurate than the clinical expert analysis in the detection of obstructive coronary disease. By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.            ",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,8762268,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Generations', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Stress', 'Stress Tests', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2014,653934,90419233,-0.0077661666671687765
"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more. This will be accomplished by: optimizing the image processing that is used, further developing new and better image processing methods, and developing a method of ""personalized imaging"", in which, for each individual patient, the minimum amount of imaging agent needed to obtain a good image is computed.            ",Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging,8674683,R01HL122484,"['4D Imaging', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Protection', 'Radioactive', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer program', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2014,782871,8894636,0.005546937946612407

"Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Applications     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract In this small business innovations research (SBIR) project, we present aiArt: Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine applications. aiArt (pronounced eye-art), with its automated image analysis tools and user-friendly telemedicine web-interface, will enable exponential expansion of diabetic retinopathy screenings, thus fulfilling a significant health need as the number of people with diabetes climbs over the years. Latino population is genetically more prone to diabetes. Factors such as lack of awareness, lack of insurance coverage, and lack of access to expert clinicians greatly increase this disparity population's vulnerability to blindness due to DR. The situation is particularly grim in Los Angeles County, where there is a backlog of several thousand patients waiting to see an ophthalmologist, causing very long appointment wait times (often over six months). To help reduce risk of vision loss in this population, we propose to use advanced image analysis algorithms in conjunction with existing telemedicine initiatives to enable faster screening, allow reprioritization of ophthalmologist appointments, and to provide patient education tools. Our automated image analysis algorithms represent cutting-edge of research in image processing, computer vision, and machine learning. The analysis engine will be closely integrated with simple, easy-to-use web-based telemedicine infrastructure provided by an existing, popular, telemedicine initiative, EyePACS.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative The proposed image analysis tools will greatly reduce the cost of diabetic retinopathy screening, and with its web and mobile phone accessible interface will drive an expansion of diabetic retinopathy screening, making it accessible to disparity populations (such as Latinos) which are not currently being screened due to socio-economic factors.

"Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 award will support my development as an independent investigator with a translational research program that specializes in the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Candidate: My research experience as a cognitive neuroscientist ideally positions me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise on the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative disease. I have strong cognitive training with an M.Sc in Psycholinguistics and Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where I was supported by an NRSA Individual Predoctoral Award. During my postdoctoral IGERT fellowship at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I was awarded an NRSA Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship Award to investigate the role of decision-making in language. In this research I have gained experience investigating neurodegenerative disease patients comparatively in order to obtain converging evidence to complement fMRI studies of healthy adults. I have become increasingly interested in translating my research to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. I was recently award the Society for the Neurobiology of Language Postdoctoral Merit Award in recognition of my novel research investigating how social limitations in patients contribute to difficulty in discourse. I have committed to four years of clinical research the NIH Loan Repayment Program, and I intend to commit to clinical research for the duration of my career. I have learned that cognitive and neuroimaging studies provide only one perspective on neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal, I plan to gain the necessary expertise in biological aspects of FTLD and related conditions to complement my past experiences, and thus achieve my goal of becoming a multifaceted independent investigator with expertise in the cognitive and biological basis for neurodegenerative diseases. With the support of this K01, I will develop expertise to conduct investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, and neuropathological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. I will ultimately integrate the biological expertise gained in this proposal with language studies from my cognitive neuroscience research in an effort to identify non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to screen patients for clinical trials and to measure the efficacy of disease-modifying agents. Environment: This award will be conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Neurology, the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR), and the Penn Bioinformatics Center where I have strong institutional support. The proposed institution is an exceptional environment that has expert centers for neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, a leading genetic research core, expert neuropathology, outstanding biostatisical support, and relevant clinical research laboratories. The University of Pennsylvania is unique in comparison to other institutions in the country because all of the above methods are available in one center. My mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentor, Dr. John Trojanowksi, have international reputations for neurodegenerative disease research. My career development will also be supported by my co-mentor, Dr. Lyle Ungar, who has extensive expertise in statistical learning algorithms and in the analysis of proteomic and genomics datasets. Together, this mentorship team will facilitate my development as an independent investigator by providing access to existing and future collaborators, laboratory resources, and exceptional training environments. The CNDR is a world- leading center for neurodegenerative disease research with human and animal models of disease and exceptional translational science. Biofluid biomarker experience is extensive, and several national biofluid cores are centered at Penn (e.g. ADNI). There is a wealth of internationally-recognized neuroimaging expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Imaging and Computer Science Laboratory, and I will benefit by integrating neuroimaging resources from these facilities with other modalities of biomarker research. Training: I will develop my expertise in the biological basis of neurodegenerative disease with the support of my mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentors, Dr. John Trojanowski and Dr. Lyle Ungar. Specifically, with Dr. Trojanowksi I will engage in training related to biofluid and genetic biomarkers of FTLD. I will develop advanced neuroimaging skills and cutting-edge biostatistical methods with Dr. Ungar. Each of these training modalities will be supported by complementary formal coursework, participation in seminars, attendance of conferences, and regularly scheduled meetings with mentorship team. Research: FTLD is a neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 15 out of 100,000 individuals. In recent years detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have demonstrated distinct sources of histopathological abnormalities in FTLD, including the presence of tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). However, there are currently no in vivo methods for discriminating between FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. There is an urgent need to improve the in vivo diagnosis of FTLD to appropriately enter patients into emerging clinical trials, and to develop sensitive and specific endpoints in trials that can quantify response to these treatments. The overall research aim of this proposal is to develop multimodal methods to improve in vivo diagnosis of FTLD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) affects approximately 15 out of 100,000 adults. Detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have identified two distinct sources of histopathological changes that contribute to FTLD. However, there are currently no in vivo methods for diagnosing pathological subtypes of FTLD. There is an urgent need to identify in vivo diagnosis methods to facilitate the identification of appropriate patients to enter into emerging disease-modifying drug treatment trials.

"Early Acute Lung Injury: Prospective Evaluation Prior to Respiratory Failure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Acute lung injury (ALI) is a syndrome of acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to pulmonary and non-pulmonary insults and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite two decades of targeted investigation by the NHLBI, little is known about ALI prior to progression to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Accordingly, the aims of this research plan are to: 1) prospectively identify independent predictors of progression to ALI requiring mechanical ventilation and establish a clinical definition of early ALI; 2) evaluate the pathogenetic role of biologic markers of inflammation and lung injury and their value for refining risk stratification of patients at risk for progression to ALI, and 3) test the potential therapeutic value of an aerosolized beta-2 agonist in patients with early ALI. In SPECIFIC AIM 1 will identify cases of potential early ALI by screening chest radiographs of all adult emergency department and medicine service admissions. Patients admitted to the hospital with bilateral opacities on chest radiograph not due to isolated left atrial hypertension will be followed for progression to ALI during their hospitalization. Clinical characteristics (demographics, diagnoses, comorbidities, vital signs, and Borg dyspnea scores) will be recorded for the first 72 hours of admission. Independent predictors of progression to ALI will be determined by multivariate logistic regression and incorporated into a clinical definition of early ALI. In SPECIFIC AIM 2, plasma levels of biomarkers (IL-8, sTNFr-1, vWF, ICAM-1, SP-D and RAGE) representing distinct pathways contributing to acute lung injury will be measured at time 0 and 24 hours after study enrollment. Biomarkers will be analyzed by multivariate regression analysis to assess their value for stratifying patients at risk for progression to ALI and provide mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of early ALI. In SPECIFIC AIM 3 I will conduct a randomized clinical trial of aerosoUzed albuterol vs. placebo in patients with early ALI. The primary endpoint will be the Pa02 / Fi02 on day 4 of treatment. Secondary outcome measures will be rate of progression to ALI and change in plasma biologic marker levels. This will be a first-of-its-kind trial to establish that patients with early ALI can be identified and treatment can be initiated prior to need for mechanical ventilation. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Following the paradigm of early goal-directed therapy for severe sepsis, clinical benefit may derive from identifying patients with early ALI and initiating treatment prior to the need for mechanical ventilation (and therefore prior to meeting current study entry criteria). Establishing evidence based clinical definition of early ALI will facilitate identification and risk stratification of subjects for enrollment in future clinical trials.

"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes.  Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.            ",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection,8528464,K23AI097225,"['Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Area', 'Aspergillosis', 'Aspergillus', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breath Tests', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Dolin', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Exhalation', 'Fingerprint', 'Fusarium', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Mucorales', 'Mucormycosis', 'Mycoses', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scedosporium', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Glutamate', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Spectrometry', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The science of Mycology', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vial device', 'Woman', 'Work', 'air sampling', 'base', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cooking', 'data mining', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2013,137160,327644200,0.0007737479008024604
"Inflammation and cardiovascular disease in RA     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, progressive, systemic, inflammatory disease that primarily attacks peripheral joints and surrounding tendons and ligaments. This often very painful and debilitating disease affects approximately 1.3 million Americans, of which about 70% are women. 10% of affected subjects suffer total disability. Over the last decade there have been considerable advances in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The use of biologic agents that antagonize tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has resulted in decreased morbidity as well as clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life. Nevertheless, a considerable proportion of RA patients, ranging from 20% to 50% in clinical trials, failed to mount a robust clinical response to these agents. Given the very high cost and potential serious toxicities associated with TNF antagonists, identification of predictors of the response to TNF antagonist therapy would help to optimize the clinical management of RA patients.  Novel optical tomographic imaging (OTI) methods have been developed in recent years and are currently tested for various clinical application ranging from breast cancer imaging to imaging of brain activities. This novel technology promises to offer new insights into the various disease processes without the use of ionizing radiation at a relatively low cost. The group of Dr. Hielscher has recently shown that OTI is particularly sensitive to small changes in finger joints affected by RA. These changes manifest themselves in differences in the optical absorption and scattering coefficients inside these joints, which come about by changes in the optical properties of the synovial fluid as well as the vasculature surrounding the joints.  We hypothesize that optical tomographic imaging (OTI) methods will be able to detect changes occurring in arthritic joints that are treated with TNF antagonist within the first few months or even weeks of treatment initiation. Therefore, the specific aim of this revision application is to perform a longitudinal observational pilot study with 20 RA patients to identify optical imaging biomarkers that can be used to predict treatment outcome. In particular we expect that patients who respond to the treatment will show an increase in the variation of the scattering and absorption coefficient across the joint. In addition, both absorption and scattering coefficients will decreas. In patients for whom treatment response is not observed, no changes will be observed over the course of the treatment. A successful study would provide preliminary data for a more extensive grant application by a newly formed interdisciplinary team of NIAMS researchers.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a painful and debilitating disease affecting approximately 1.5 million Americans. The last decade has seen the development of a new group of RA drugs called biologic response modifiers or biologics that can greatly improve the quality of life. However, not all patients respond to these new drugs and given the very high cost and potential serious side effects it is highly desirable to find biomarkers that can predict f a patient will respond to a particular drug or not. We propose to test in a clinical pilot study involving 20 RA patients, if a novel optical imaging system can be used to predict treatment outcome within a few weeks of treatment initiation.            ",Inflammation and cardiovascular disease in RA,8585677,R01AR050026,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'American', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Applications Grants', 'Arthritis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain imaging', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Assisted', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Modifying Second-Line Drugs', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Finger joint structure', 'Fingers', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Joints', 'Ligaments', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Methotrexate', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Optical Methods', 'Optical Tomography', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Surgeon', 'Synovial Fluid', 'System', 'Technology', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'absorption', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'college', 'cost', 'disability', 'follow-up', 'healthy volunteer', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'new technology', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'professor', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'rheumatologist', 'socioeconomics', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2013,147421,558628098,-0.022348368100747276
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,8593988,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'human CCL26 protein', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2013,156324,507546965,-0.021467823945147596
"In-field FAST Procedure Support and Automation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) procedure is an ultrasound examination performed to identify intra-peritoneal hemorrhage or pericardial tamponade. FAST involves the detection of free fluid in ultrasound images from four specific abdominal areas. Unstable patients with positive FAST results are operated on, and stable patients with negative results tend to be observed.  We propose to develop the hardware and image analysis algorithms necessary for novice ultrasound operators to perform life-saving FAST procedures. The proposed system will consist of a low-cost ultrasound probe, connected to a ruggedize tablet computer, running innovative computer vision algorithms, embedded in an intuitive application. Using that system, a novice operator will be visually guided to acquire ultrasound images from the abdominal locations and quantify the free fluid in those images.  The target for our initial deployment of the system is level 3 and 4 trauma centers. These centers must often serve areas spanning hundreds and even thousands of miles; however, they are typically under-staffed and under-equipped.  The proposal is being clinically driven by Jeffrey Lowell, MD. He is a USNR Trauma Surgeon, and he was recently deployed to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, the only Level I Trauma Center outside the U.S.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) procedure is an ultrasound-based examination for rapidly detecting blood in the abdomen, particularly after blunt abdominal trauma, which is common, for example, with car accidents. The challenge is that the FAST procedure requires expertise and equipment which is not commonly available at level 3 and 4 trauma centers that serve rural populations. We propose to develop the hardware and image analysis algorithms necessary for novice ultrasound operators to perform life- saving FAST procedures. The proposed system will consist of a low-cost, hand-held ultrasound probe, connected to a ruggedize tablet computer, running innovative computer vision algorithms, embedded in an easy-to-follow software application.            ",In-field FAST Procedure Support and Automation,8472102,R43EB016621,"['Abdomen', 'Abdominal Injuries', 'Accidents', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Blood', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Funding', 'Hand', 'Hemoperitoneum', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nurses', 'Operating Rooms', 'Organ Harvestings', 'Organ Procurements', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pelvis', 'Pericardial body location', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical Examination', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transplant Surgeon', 'Trauma', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncompensated Care', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'emergency service responder', 'experience', 'follower of religion Jewish', 'health disparity', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pericardial sac', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'trauma centers']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R43,2013,200000,5161939,-0.007962682271918736
"Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence  Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence Translation of biomedical research into practice depends in part on the production of quality systematic reviews that synthesize available evidence. Unfortunately, about 20% of reviews are never completed. Of those that reach fruition, the average time to completion may be 2.4 years, with a reported maximum of 9 years. A major bottleneck occurs when teammates screen studies. In the first step, they independently identify provisionally eligible studies by reading the same set of perhaps thousands of titles and abstracts. To date, researchers have used supervised machine learning (ML) methods in an attempt to automate identification of eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, finding nonrandomized (NR) studies for inclusion in systematic reviews has yet to be addressed. This is an important problem because RCTs may be unlikely or even unethical for some research questions. Hypotheses. It is broadly hypothesized that (a) methods based on natural language processing and ML can be used to automatically identify topically relevant studies with a mix of NR designs eligible for inclusion in systematic reviews; and (b) machine performance can consistently reach current human standards with respect to identifying eligible studies. Aims. This research has three aims: (1) Compare the language that biomedical researchers use to describe their NR study designs with existing relevant vocabularies. Develop complementary terminologies for overlooked NR study designs to improve coverage of important vocabularies. Develop and validate a standalone terminology to support librarians who add free-text terms to expert searches. (2) Develop and compare procedures based on natural language processing and supervised ML methods to identify provisionally eligible NR studies that are topically relevant from a set of citations, including titles, abstracts, and metadata. Use terms for NR study designs to improve classification. (3) Generalize procedures developed under Aims 1 and 2 to select topically relevant studies with a mix of designs for provisional inclusion in several types of systematic reviews. Use contextual information in segments of full texts tagged for location to enrich feature vectors. Methods. Reference standards will be built from studies in published Cochrane reviews. Features will be extracted from citations and regions of full texts. Additionally, feature vectors will be enriched with terms for designs that researchers use in combination with terms extracted from major vocabularies. Model performance will be compared with respect to several measures, including mean recall and precision, for 10-fold cross-validations and validations on held-out test sets. Significance. The proposed research is significant because it will help support translation of biomedical research to improve human health. Moreover, developing procedures to identify NR studies is essential for the expeditious translation of a very large body of research.  Translation of biomedical research helps to improve public health by delivering the best available evidence to clinicians. This process depends in part on the production of systematic reviews of research. Computerized procedures will be developed to reduce the labor associated with screening nonrandomized studies for inclusion in reviews.",Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence,8484438,R00LM010943,"['Address', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Health', 'Human', 'Language', 'Librarians', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reading', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computerized', 'design', 'improved', 'research to practice', 'screening', 'systematic review', 'vector']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2013,202118,570146095,-0.006856012965395258
"Clinical Image Retrieval: User needs assessment toolbox development & evaluation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Advances in digital imaging technologies have led to a substantial growth in the number of digital images being created and stored in hospitals, medical systems, and on the Internet in recent years. Effective medical image retrieval systems can play an important role in teaching, research, diagnosis and treatment. Images were historically retrieved using text-based methods. The quality of annotations associated with images can reduce the effectiveness of text-based image retrieval. Despite recent advances, purely content- based image retrieval techniques lag significantly behind their textual counterparts in their ability to capture the semantic essence of the user's query. Preliminary research suggests that a more promising approach is to adaptively combine these complementary techniques to suit the user and their information needs. However, for these approaches to succeed, the researcher needs to enhance her computational skills in addition to acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the relevant clinical domain. This Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) grant application describes a training and career development plan that will allow the candidate, an NLM postdoctoral fellow in Medical Informatics at Oregon Health & Science University to achieve these objectives. The training component will be carried out under the mentorship of Dr. W. Hersh with Dr. Gorman (user studies). Dr. Fuss (radiation medicine) and Dr. Erdogmus (machine learning) providing additional mentoring in their areas of expertise.       The long-term goal of this Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) project is to improve visual information retrieval by better understanding user needs and proposing adaptive methodologies for multimodal image retrieval that will close the semantic gap. During the award period, activities will be focused on the following specific aims: (1) Understand the image retrieval needs of novice and expert users in radiation oncology and develop gold standards for evaluation; (2) Develop algorithms for semantic, multimodal image retrieval; (3) Perform user based evaluation of adaptive image retrieval in radiation oncology; (4) Extend the techniques developed to create a multimodal image retrieval system in pathology          n/a",Clinical Image Retrieval: User needs assessment toolbox development & evaluation,8522304,R00LM009889,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Applications Grants', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion', 'Distance Learning', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image retrieval system', 'Imaging technology', 'Information Retrieval', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric System', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Needs Assessment', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Oregon', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality Control', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer site', 'care delivery', 'career development', 'data mining', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'improved', 'information model', 'meetings', 'oncology', 'open source', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'visual information']",NLM,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R00,2013,216041,551214295,0.001905517512641188
"Coupled level set framework for retinal segmentation and atlasing in SD-OCT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Some eye diseases exhibit abnormalities or atrophy of the retina, which can impair vision and cause blindness. Certain other diseases traditionally thought to be exclusively associated with the brain are now known to be associated with changes or differences in the retina, which can also impair vision. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), an imaging device that is enabling modern in-vivo high-resolution studies of the retina, is rapidly becoming a key imaging technology both in ophthalmology, where clinical diagnoses and disease monitoring are experiencing a dramatic technical revolution, and also in neurology, where noninvasive retinal markers of brain disease are beginning to emerge. A key limitation in the current technology is the lack of detailed, accurate, and fully-automated analysis of the retinal layers that are observed throughout the retina in a typical three-dimensional spectral domain (SD)-OCT exam. Although tools are beginning to appear in association with commercial devices, they are currently lacking in sophistication and are not validated or standardized across manufacturers. This deficiency is problematic for both clinical and scientific application of SD-OCT since the measurements are not of known precision and are therefore not easily compared both in the same subject longitudinally and in population cross sections. The proposed research takes advantage of state-of-the-art algorithms that are emerging in both computer vision and medical imaging and will apply, adapt, and extend them to the specific application of layer segmentation in three-dimensional retinal SD-OCT. Advanced tools for population averaging in a normalized space will also be developed specifically for retinal SD-OCT data. The methods will be validated against manual segmentation and normalization on both normal subjects and patients experiencing retinal degeneration largely associated with thinning of selective layers of the retina. Scans of patients with diseases causing significant retinopathy such as cysts, detachment, or scarring will be evaluated, but further development beyond the present research is expected to be needed to properly segment and quantify such cases. The developed software will be developed within the open-source Java Image Science Toolkit (JIST) framework and released as open source software.        The project will develop software for the image analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the retina. Segmentation and quantification of the characteristics of nerve layers within the retina is expected to be of great use on both ophthalmology and neurology, where the retina can be a sensitive indicator of both vision and neurological problems or diseases. Open source software written in a highly portable language will be made available to the research community at the conclusion of the research grant.

"BIGDATA Small Project Structurization and Direct Search of Medical Image Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): IBM estimates that 30% of the entire data in the world is medical information. Medical images occupy a significant portion of medical records with approximately 100 million scans in US and growing every year. In addition, the data size from each scan steadfastly increases as the image resolution improves. These BigData are not structured and due to lack of standardized imaging protocols, they are highly heterogeneous with different spatial resolutions, contrasts, slice orientations, etc. In this project, we will deelop a technology to structure and search medical imaging information, which will make the past data available for education and evidence-based clinical decision-making. In this grant, we will focus on brain MRI, which comprises the largest portion of MRI data. The target community will be physicians who make decisions and the patients will be the ultimate beneficiaries. Currently, radiological image data are stored in clinical database called PACS. The image data in PACS are not structured. Consequently, once the diagnosis of a patient is completed, most of the data in PACS are currently discarded in the archive. Radiologists rely on their experience and education to reach medical decisions. This is a typical problem in medical practice that calls for objective evidence-based medicine. There are many ongoing attempts to structure the text fields of PACS, which include natural language processing of free-text radiological reports, clinical information, and diagnosis. In our approach, we propose to structure the image data, not text fields, to support direct search of images. Namely, physicians will submit an image of a new patient and search past images with similar anatomical phenotypes. Then, the clinical reports of the retrieved data will be compiled for a statistical report of the diagnosis and prognosis. We believe this image structuration is the key to ""unlock the vast amounts of information currently stored"" in PACS and use them for education and modern evidence-based medical decisions. The specific aims are; Objective 1: To develop and test the accuracy of high-throughput image structuration technologies Objective 2: To develop and test the image search engine Objective 3: Capacity Building Requirement: To develop prototype cloud system for data structuration / search services for research and educational purposes                  n/a",BIGDATA Small Project Structurization and Direct Search of Medical Image Data,8599843,R01EB017638,"['Archives', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Image', 'Information Systems', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'beneficiary', 'clinical decision-making', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'outcome forecast', 'prototype', 'radiologist']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,224942,807432003,-0.008889711838550411
"Automated retinopathy of prematurity classification using machine learning  Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this project is to develop a web-based, semi-automated system for identifying severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) with ""plus disease,"" using an existing data set of retinal images collected from previous NIH- funded research studies. ROP is treatable if diagnosed early, yet continues to be a leading cause of childhood blindness throughout the world. Diagnosis and documentation of ophthalmoscopic findings in ROP are subjective and qualitative, and studies have found that there is often significant diagnostic variation, even when experts are shown the exact same clinical data. Computer-based image analysis and the application of machine learning techniques to feature extraction and image classification have potential to address many of these limitations. Recent advances in image processing have had led to sophisticated techniques for tracing vessel-like structures. Additionally, machine-learning techniques will enable us to leverage these existing annotated image databases to improve the performance of our algorithms for vessel segmentation and disease classification. Our overall hypothesis is that retinal vascular features may be quantified and used to assist clinicians in the diagnosis of ROP. These hypotheses will be tested using two Specific Aims: (1) Develop and evaluate semi-automated algorithms to segment retinal vessels and generate a set of retinal vessel-based features. (2) Develop computer-based decision support algorithms that best correlate with expert opinions. Overall, this project will build upon infrastructure developed from previous studies, create potential for improving the accuracy and consistency of clinical ROP diagnosis, provide a demonstration of computer-based decision support from image analysis during real-world medical care, and stimulate future research toward understanding the vascular features associated with severe ROP. This project will be performed by a multi- disciplinary team of investigators with expertise in ophthalmology, biomedical informatics, computer science, machine learning, and image processing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of childhood blindness in the United States and throughout the world, and current diagnostic and documentation methods are often subjective and qualitative. We propose to use existing data sets to develop a web- based, semi-automated system for identifying severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) with ""plus disease"" from retinal images. This has potential to improve the accuracy and consistency of ROP diagnosis, provide a demonstration of computer-based decision support from image analysis during real-world medical care, and stimulate future research toward understanding the vascular features associated with severe ROP.                 ",Automated retinopathy of prematurity classification using machine learning,8445584,R21EY022387,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Opinion', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infant', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Online Systems', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Premature Infant', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Tubular formation', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'image processing', 'improved', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'retina blood vessel structure', 'two-dimensional']",NEI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2013,283543,551214295,-0.023667655756722604
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into the causes, pathogenesis, and natural history of DILI. The ongoing Retrospective study has collected 109 DNA samples from subjects with liver injury attributed to one of 8 drugs. In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and outcomes of drug induced liver injury via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients into the ongoing DILIN Prospective and Retrospective studies. The collection of early blood and urine samples from well-characterized DILI patients will allow for innovative studies of patient, drug and environmental risk factors. Further development of a computerized diagnostic instrument and expansion of the LiverTox website is also planned which will provide doctors, researchers, and the general public an authoritative and up-to-date resource that can help accelerate DILI research in the US and abroad.            ",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013,8627692,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anabolic steroids', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Ancillary Study', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Budesonide', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Expert Opinion', 'Floxacillin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Histopathology', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Injury to Liver', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular', 'Monograph', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Valproic Acid', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'chemical property', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'elastography', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'screening', 'transcriptomics', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2013,321402,641965656,-0.017398465194651654
"Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in the laboratory sciences have led to the discovery of a large number of candidate biomarkers, which hold great potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. At this time, an important research bottleneck is the lack of well-developed statistical methods for effectively using these candidate biomarkers to enhance clinical practice. It is our goal to develop new tools to select, combine, and evaluate biomarkers for disease classification and treatment selection. Classification markers predict an individual's disease outcome and are useful for the detection of diseases at an early stage when a treatment is most effective. Research proposed in Aim 1 seeks to select and combine markers to improve the classification performance in disease screening and diagnosis. Treatment selection markers predict a patient's response to different therapies and allow for the selection of a therapy that has the best predicted outcome. Aim 2 seeks to develop marker-based treatment selection rules to maximize the benefit to the patient population. A biomarker that is useful for guiding treatment decision to the general population will have different values to different patients due to individual differences in their response to treatment and in their tolerance of the disease harm and treatment cost. Aim 3 seeks to develop a new graphical tool to customize the evaluation of a biomarker for aiding treatment decision based on personal characteristics.  Our statistical methods will apply broadly to general medical fields.

"Automated Web-Based Behavioral Diagnostics of Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade. A critical goal of Alzheimer's disease research is to improve current methods of diagnosis so that patients can be identified sooner and, therefore, obtain greater advantage from available therapies. The major goal of this project is to develop and validate an automated, web-based method for early diagnosis of cognitive decline and memory loss. We will build on current research that has demonstrated a clear link between performance on the Visual Paired- Comparison Task (VPC) and diagnosis of MCI, and we will extend the impact of this finding by developing a suite of software tools and analysis methods that will improve the accuracy and extend the accessibility of cognitive diagnostics with a web-based VPC task that can be widely deployed. Although the VPC task is promising as a diagnostic aid, clinical application is severely limited by the need to use an eye tracker to precisely monitor subjects' eye movements. Unfortunately, eye trackers are expensive, require trained personnel, and are not widely available. However, our preliminary findings show that it is possible to produce picture examination behavior that is similar to eye-movements, using modified versions of the VPC task that could be administered by anyone, on any computer with an internet connection. In addition, powerful machine learning techniques from computer science can help accurately analyze and diagnose the resulting behavior. An important contribution from this work will be the possibility of predicting oncoming cognitive decline in MCI patients sooner than is now possible, that is, at a time when the nervous system is less compromised and more likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. In support of this objective, we propose three aims: 1) Develop and investigate appropriate representation of eye movement characteristics and corresponding machine learning-based classification techniques for effective identification of the patient status, 2) Develop and validate a web-based version of the VPC task, and 3) explore the feasibility of our task as an automatic screening instrument for the general elderly population. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to dramatically alter the current practice of clinical translational research as well as the current methods used for diagnosing cognitive deficits. This would enable thousands and potentially millions of patients and potential research subjects to take the test as part of their routine checkup, requiring nothing more than a computer with an internet connection.

"Hand Sensorimotor Function and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The median nerve is susceptible to compression in the wrist, leading to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is the most common compression neuropathy and have an immense impact on national health care, worker productivity, and quality of life. Despite its high prevalence and public health cost, our understanding of CTS is limited, and the management of CTS awaits improvement. The central notion of this project is that hand sensorimotor function is sensitive to peripheral median neuropathy and that the central nervous system is affected by CTS, causing the associated sensorimotor deficit. We will investigate this notion with quantifiable sensorimotor data from novel biomechanical and neurophysiological studies. This project has three aims consisting of biomechanical, neurophysiological and translational research. The first aim is to investigate CTS-induced pathokinematic and pathokinetic performance using dexterous manual tasks of thumb opposition, reach-to-pinch, precision grip, and finger pressing. The second aim is to investigate the neurophysiological implications of chronic peripheral neuropathy (i.e., CTS) on the central nervous system by evaluating corticomuscular coupling and stretch reflex. The third aim is to identify novel biomechanical and neurophysiological markers for CTS cases using machine learning and classification algorithms. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of CTS and aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder. More generally, CTS as a chronic neuropathy serves as an effective model to study sensorimotor mechanisms of the peripheral and central nervous systems. In addition, the methodology developed in this project is applicable to other neuromuscular disorders.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly. One of the distinct consequences of carpal tunnel syndrome is that patients experience inexplicable dropping of objects and clumsiness while performing simple daily tasks. In this project, we propose to study the sensorimotor deficit using novel biomechanical and neurophysiological experiments. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and manifestations of carpal tunnel syndrome. This project is clinically translational to aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder.

"3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical assessment of optic nerve swelling is limited by the subjective ophthalmoscopic evaluation by experts in order to diagnose and differentiate the cause of the optic disc edema. The long-term goal of our research effort is to develop automated 3D image-analysis approaches for the identification of an optimal set of 3D parameters to quantify the severity of optic nerve edema over time and to help differentiate the underlying cause. The overall objective in this application is to develop strategies, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve swelling in patients diagnosed with papilledema and to ascertain morphological features that differentiate papilledema from other disorders causing optic nerve edema. The central hypothesis is that information about volumetric and shape parameters obtainable from 3D image analysis techniques will improve the ability to accurately assess the severity and cause of optic disc edema over the existing subjective ophthalmoscopic assessment of optic nerve swelling using the Fris¿n scale or current 2D OCT parameters. The rationale for the proposed research is that having such 3D parameters will dramatically improve the way optic disc swelling is assessed. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1. Develop and evaluate the methodology for computing novel volumetric and shape parameters of a swollen optic nerve head from SD-OCT. This will be completed by refining and evaluating our novel 3D graph-based segmentation algorithms in SD-OCT volumes of patients with optic disc swelling. 2. Identify SD-OCT parameters that optimally correlate with clinical measurements of severity in patients with papilledema and develop a continuous severity scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to relate SD-OCT parameters to expert-defined Fris¿n scale grades (a fundus-based measure of severity). It is anticipated that volumetric 3D parameters will more closely correlate with clinical measures than 2D parameters and will provide a continuous severity scale. 3. Identify SD-OCT parameters that differentiate papilledema from other causes of optic disc swelling (or apparent optic disc swelling, as in pseudopapilledema) and develop a corresponding predictive classifier. Our working hypothesis is that 3D shape parameters, especially those near Bruch's membrane opening, will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach is innovative because the 3D image-analysis methodology developed by the applicants enables novel determination of 3D volumetric and shape parameters and represents a significant improvement over the status quo of using qualitative image information and 2D OCT image information for assessing optic disc swelling. The proposed research is significant because it will help to establish a much-needed alternative and more objective method by which to assess the severity and cause of optic disc swelling.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of novel spectral-domain optical coherence tomography parameters for assessing the severity and cause of optic nerve edema is expected to enable more efficient and effective diagnosis and management strategies of patients with such swelling. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to reduce the burdens of disability and is particularly relevant to the part of NEI's mission regarding understanding blinding eye diseases and preserving sight.                ",3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema,8477880,R01EY023279,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Papilledema', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Swelling', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'digital', 'disability burden', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'public health relevance']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2013,339750,193405667,0.005702179153097633

"A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI  A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI NeuroEnabling Technologies, Inc. RESEARCH & RELATED Other Project Information 7. PROJECT SUMMARY Of the approximately 10 million people in the US living with paralysis, 15,000 are the result of spinal cord injury each year. The first year of care can range from $322,000-$986,000, with lifetime costs of $1.4-4M for someone injured at 25 years of age. In addition to potentially devastating sensorimotor disturbances, there is a huge financial cost, estimated to be $13.55B in medical care, therapy, and lost productivity nationwide. Until very recently, the recovery from spinal cord injury (SCI) was bleak, with little hope of restoring motor function. To address this we have demonstrated that the physiological state of the spinal circuitry of rats and cats can be modulated with epidural stimulation to generate voluntary limb motor function over a range of speeds, loads, and directions, a finding we have extended to humans. Three years post-injury, a motor complete spinal cord injured human subject was implanted with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord. In less than one month after implantation, the subject could stand independently, and after 7 months of daily epidural stimulation and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of epidural stimulation, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of epidural stimulation. We will advance these discoveries with the use of non-invasive stimulation of the lumbosacral cord to improve lower limb function following SCI. Central to this proposal is our discovery of a painless electrical multi-channel (stimulation of multiple parts of the spinal cord) theranostic tool that can be applied to the surface of the skin, termed transcutaneous spinal cord electrical stimulation (TESCS), bypassing the need for a surgically-implanted electrode array. In the first phase of this proposal we will demonstrate proof-of-principle that stimulation of the lumbosacral spinal cord can assess spared spinal motor function by: 1) Testing responses to transcutaneous electrical stimulation in subjects with spinal cord injury; and 2) defining the operational parameters of electrical stimulation that that are most effective using a machine-learning protocol, and 3) produce a multi-channel commercial prototype. This commercial product will undergo testing similar to the proof-of- principle device. This device will then be tested in subjects with cervicothoracic spinal cord injury and evaluated with a machine-learning protocol. This Phase I proposal will deliver a device that can painlessly and non-invasively aid in the assessment and recovery of SCI by delivering a specific electrical stimulation paradigm to the lumbosacral cord that improves use of the lower limbs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI NeuroEnabling Technologies, Inc. PROJECT NARRATIVE It now seems possible to apply three interventions: transcutaneous stimulation, administration of pharmacological agents, and motor training, to assess and enable the excitability of spared neural circuits in humans with a thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI), thus enabling these individuals to regain use of their legs. This enabling effect is similar to that observed with improved postura and locomotor function after a mid-thoracic SCI in which epidural stimulation was used. We will build and demonstrate a multi-channel transcutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation theranostic tool that we propose will allow assessment and enabling of lower limb function following a cervicothoracic spinal cord injury.                ",A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI,8648234,R43EB018232,"['Address', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Ankle', 'Bypass', 'Caring', 'Cervical', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Felis catus', 'Financial cost', 'Goals', 'Hip region structure', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Leg', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Lower Extremity', 'Lumbar spinal cord structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Modality', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurostimulation procedures of spinal cord tissue', 'Outpatients', 'Painless', 'Paralysed', 'Paraplegia', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Residual state', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Cord Part', 'Spinal Injuries', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Spinal cord injury patients', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Training', 'Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation', 'Translating', 'Upper Extremity', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'design', 'human subject', 'human subject protection', 'implantation', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'injured', 'life time cost', 'meetings', 'motor control', 'motor function improvement', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'theranostics', 'tool', 'transcutaneous stimulation']",NIBIB,"NEUROENABLING TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2013,346207,0,-0.012263605310172636
"Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build and test a dynamic vascular optical tomographic imaging (DVOTI) system that can be used to detect and monitor peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is estimated to affect approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. However, the disease is considerably under-diagnosed, since most patients are asymptomatic and no single reliable screening modality has been established. Most of the undiagnosed and untreated patients are diabetics. They commonly suffer from peripheral neuropathy and hence do not sense and report symptoms (such as pain) that are early signs of the disease. Consequently more than 60% (~65,000 per year) of all lower extremity amputations in the United States are performed in diabetic patients with PAD. With the number of diabetic patients expected to triple and reach almost 100 million by 2050, the problems related to undiagnosed PAD will only rise in the years to come  The most widely used diagnostic test for PAD, determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in conjunction with pulse-volume recordings (PVR), is known to be unreliable for diabetics. And even in non- diabetics, ABI with PVR and all other existing diagnostic tests (such as Duplex Ultrasound or Magnetic resonance angiography), only provides accurate information about proximal occlusions in major arteries of the leg. However, none of these tests assess the distal perfusion of the foot where most complications, such as ulcers and gangrene, typically occur. Monitoring the success of surgical interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, suffers from the same shortcomings, as physicians are limited to the same suite of tests that are inadequate to assess the perfusion of the foot.  Dynamic VOTI promises to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic and monitoring techniques and has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift concerning how vascular diseases are assessed. In preliminary studies we have shown that DVOTI can provide three-dimensional time-series images that provide valuable information about the perfusion of the vascular bed in feet of PAD patients. The near-infrared light used in the instrument has no adverse health effects and measurements can be repeated frequently to monitor post interventional progress. Therefore, we believe that DVOTI will prove to be a safe and accurate method to diagnose and monitor PAD in non-diabetic and diabetic patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build and test a novel optical imaging system that will allow for the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. The disease is considerably under-diagnosed, especially in diabetic patients, the elderly, and patients with kidney disease. The system will address an unmet need to directly assess the degree of blood perfusion in the feet, where most PAD-related complications occur, which lead to over 65,000 amputations each year.            ",Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease,8580503,R01HL115336,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Angioplasty', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Gangrene', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preventive', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ulcer', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'blood perfusion', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'foot', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'light emission', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optical imaging', 'post intervention', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'success', 'theories', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'vascular bed']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2013,469362,61807989,-3.723330983286885e-05
"Improving Prematurity-related Respiratory Outcomes at Vanderbilt (IMPROV)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease that impacts the pulmonary and overall health of more than 10,000 infants in the US each year. The long-term objective of this Clinical Research Center (CRC) is translation of biochemical, genetic and bioinformatics research into innovative interventions that improve outcomes of extremely preterm infants at risk for long- term pulmonary morbidity. Our proposal focuses specifically on the urea cycle-nitric oxide (UC-NO) and glutathione (GSH) pathways as pivotal and interrelated mechanisms in the response of the developing lung to the extrauterine environment. Overall hypotheses: (1) Biochemical immaturity and functional genetic variation in the UC-NO and GSH pathways modulate the BPD phenotype spectrum; (2) The duration and degree of NO insufficiency and free radical excess predicts BPD severity and correlates with pulmonary morbidity after NICU discharge. To investigate our hypothesis, our CRC will enroll 250 infants with birthweights 510-1250 grams and follow the survivors through 1 year of life. Our hypothesis invokes an immature hepatic and gut synthetic capacity to make citrulline and GSH, functional genetic variations in the UC-NO and GSH pathways, nutritional deficiencies and the physiologic and environmental stress of preterm birth. The resultant NO deficiency and free radical excess alters pulmonary vascular and alveolar development. Our biomarker discovery concept includes (a) collection of plasma, urine, red blood cells, DNA and tracheal aspirates for measurements of NO and GSH precursor sufficiency, production of NO metabolites and GSH, functional genetic variants in these pathways, and biomarkers of in vivo oxidative stress and (b) validation of these biomarkers for diagnosis and long term prognosis of patients with BPD. A bioinformatics approach using machine learning and predictive modeling has been developed for respiratory phenotyping and risk stratification at 36 weeks and 40 weeks postmenstrual age and at 12 months after hospital discharge. Accomplishment of these goals will promote novel clinical trials design to test new therapies to prevent BPD and improve long term pulmonary health of infants born preterm. (End of Abstract)      RELEVANCE: Each year in the US, more than 10,000 premature infants develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease associated with prolonged and recurrent hospitalizations and lifelong alterations in lung function. This proposal will explore developmental, genetic and environmental interactions and identify biochemical markers to predict BPD development and severity, with the ultimate goal of designing new treatments to prevent BPD and improve long-term lung function in premature infants.              n/a",Improving Prematurity-related Respiratory Outcomes at Vanderbilt (IMPROV),8468005,U01HL101456,"['Admission activity', 'Age', 'Alveolar', 'Amino Acids', 'Arginine', 'Aspirate substance', 'Beds', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia', 'Categories', 'Censuses', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Citrulline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'County Hospitals', 'Cysteine', 'DNA', 'DNA Repository', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Erythrocytes', 'F2-Isoprostanes', 'Free Radicals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Glutathione', 'Glutathione Disulfide', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Homocysteine', 'Homocystine', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Infant', 'Infant Health', 'Intervention', 'Isoprostanes', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methionine', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nutritional', 'Online Systems', 'Ornithine', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxides', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Predictive Value', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specimen', 'Stratification', 'Stress', 'Study Subject', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'design', 'developmental genetics', 'gastrointestinal', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'oxidant stress', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sample collection', 'urea cycle']",NHLBI,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,U01,2013,519792,199779478,-0.024004175480409992
"Noninvasive Assessment of Neuromuscular Disease using Electrical Impedance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuromuscular disorders include a wide group of conditions ranging from relatively mild focal problems, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, to severe, generalized diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Current methods for evaluating these disorders remain limited to a variety of tests and procedures that are either invasive or remarkably qualitative in nature. One newer technique, electrical impedance myography (EIM), offers the prospect of obtaining quantitative data on muscle condition painlessly and non-invasively. However, no commercial devices specifically tailored for EIM use exist, with nearly all previous EIM work relying upon off-the-shelf bioimpedance devices designed for ""whole-body"" rather than single-muscle assessment. In Phase 1 of this SBIR, Convergence Medical Devices, Inc (CMD) developed an initial prototype system to test proof-of-principle innovative concepts in circuit design and data acquisition to provide highly sensitive and accurate data at an extended frequency range (out to 10 MHz) and over multiple angles relative to the major muscle fiber direction. This work was followed by supplemental work that produced the first hand-held device with robust electronics capable of similar measurements with a detachable, interchangeable electrode array. In this 3-year Phase 2 SBIR, CMD proposes to further refine that technology so as to assist in disease diagnosis and for following disease progression, with a specific focus on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In Aim 1 of the proposed grant, testing of multiple electrode array designs will be performed on a group of normal subjects and those with ALS to determine which electrode array designs offer the greatest reproducibility and ability to discriminate healthy from diseased individuals. In Aim 2, the device and the 3 ""best"" array designs identified in Aim 1 will be tested in 30 ALS patients, 30 patients with syndromes mimicking ALS (e.g., polyradiculopathy and motor-predominant neuropathy), and 30 subjects with suspected/possible ALS to determine the single best array design for diagnosis and to determine its sensitivity and specificity. This study will take place at CMD and four external sites and will be managed by the Northeast ALS trials Consortium (NEALS), the premier organization for overseeing clinical trials in ALS. In Aim 3, the 30 suspected/possible ALS patients recruited in SA2 and 30 additional suspected/possible ALS patients will be assessed monthly using EIM and the 3 arrays identified in SA1. All subjects will also undergo standard measurements of disease progression including handheld dynamometry, ALS Functional Rating Scale, and spirometry. The best array design for assessing disease progression will be identified and compared to conventional markers of disease progression to determine EIM's sensitivity to disease status. Thus, at the conclusion of this research program, we anticipate having developed and vigorously tested an EIM device and associated electrode designs that together will serve as a powerful new diagnostic and monitoring tool for neuromuscular disease.          The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone. In this study, Convergence Medical Devices, in collaboration with neurologists at several medical centers, will develop and test a new device based on the concept of electrical impedance myography, a technique that offers the promise of rapid and accurate disease assessment. With the completion of this study, a new, painless tool will be developed and studied that will assist in individual patient care and will speed drug testing in clinical trials in diseases ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and muscular dystrophy to radiculopathy and polyneuropathy.

"Real-Time MRI Motion Correction System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MOTIVATION - Motion remains one of the most frequent contributors to image artifacts in MR studies.  The motion susceptibility of MRI is well-known and has spawned a number of elegant navigation techniques.  These methods, however, are tailored to specific MR acquisitions that require modified k-space trajectories or the acquisition of additional MR data, and most are unable to correct certain types of motion, for example, through-plane motion.  Moreover, motion correction has been focused on specific families of sequences, but no generally applicable approach currently exists.  Certain patient populations, such as pediatric or geriatric patients, are more likely to move than others.  In pediatric imaging, anesthesia is used to control motion, adding substantially to exam costs and patient risks.  A sequence-independent, autonomous and prospective motion correction system could greatly improve image quality for a wide spectrum of MR examinations.  For pediatric imaging, in particular, we anticipate reduced reliance on anesthesia to control patient motion.  AIMS - We will be focusing on three independent specific aims (carried out in parallel and completed within 4 years), with corresponding subaims that we believe are important for establishing the technical/scientific merit and to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed R&D efforts for our real-time adaptive motion correction approach.  Specifically, these aims are:  (1) to develop and evaluate a coil-mounted MR-compatible tracking device for routine clinical use; (2) to integrate pose tracking into real-time MRI; and (3) to validate our real-time motion correction system in volunteers and patients.  METHODS -In Aim 1 we will improve the methods for computer-vision-based pose estimation inside an MR scanner and build an MR-compatible coil-mounted pose tracker that can be used in clinical routine examinations.  In Aim 2 we will focus on reducing the latency between pose changes happening and the MR scanner reacting to these pose changes, and on building a software library for the MR pulse sequence development that allows one to implement real-time motion correction into all MR pulse sequences.  In Aim 3 we will perform a thorough evaluation of our system on 60 volunteers (30 adults and 30 children) and 120 patients (80 adults and 40 children).  SIGNIFICANCE - The impact of our technology has several facets.  First, it will improve patient care by reducing the number of MR images with compromised quality because of motion artifacts.  Especially because of the increasing reliance on MR Images as a primary means of diagnosis, this will reduce the number of misdiagnoses.  Secondly, this technology will help to lower the high national spending on imaging by dramatically improving the efficiency of MRI scanners.  Finally, it will improve patient comfort by reducing the need for repeat sequences, as well as reduce the necessity of sedation aimed at keeping the patient still.  Overall, this technology will have a significant impact on MRI both in clinical practice and basic science research.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Synopsis Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.  This is not only of increasing concern due to the aging population and its associated diseases, but also in children and patients who are simply too sick to remain still during an exam.  This proposal aims to build an optical tracking system and methods to adapt MRI pulse sequences to changes in patient pose in real time.  The project leverages on previous work from an R21 project in which a prototype system was successfully built.  Specifically, the aims are to (i) introduce innovative improvements to the existing prototype, making the system suitable for use in clinical routine, (ii) modify the optical tracking system to be compatible with multiple MR sequences, and (iii) perform clinical evaluation.  Our real-time technique is a unique and innovative solution that will improve MRI image quality and thus patient care, and will address the escalating burden of imaging costs on the health care system.

"Early Acute Lung Injury: Prospective Evaluation Prior to Respiratory Failure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Acute lung injury (ALI) is a syndrome of acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to pulmonary and non-pulmonary insults and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite two decades of targeted investigation by the NHLBI, little is known about ALI prior to progression to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Accordingly, the aims of this research plan are to: 1) prospectively identify independent predictors of progression to ALI requiring mechanical ventilation and establish a clinical definition of early ALI; 2) evaluate the pathogenetic role of biologic markers of inflammation and lung injury and their value for refining risk stratification of patients at risk for progression to ALI, and 3) test the potential therapeutic value of an aerosolized beta-2 agonist in patients with early ALI. In SPECIFIC AIM 1 will identify cases of potential early ALI by screening chest radiographs of all adult emergency department and medicine service admissions. Patients admitted to the hospital with bilateral opacities on chest radiograph not due to isolated left atrial hypertension will be followed for progression to ALI during their hospitalization. Clinical characteristics (demographics, diagnoses, comorbidities, vital signs, and Borg dyspnea scores) will be recorded for the first 72 hours of admission. Independent predictors of progression to ALI will be determined by multivariate logistic regression and incorporated into a clinical definition of early ALI. In SPECIFIC AIM 2, plasma levels of biomarkers (IL-8, sTNFr-1, vWF, ICAM-1, SP-D and RAGE) representing distinct pathways contributing to acute lung injury will be measured at time 0 and 24 hours after study enrollment. Biomarkers will be analyzed by multivariate regression analysis to assess their value for stratifying patients at risk for progression to ALI and provide mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of early ALI. In SPECIFIC AIM 3 I will conduct a randomized clinical trial of aerosoUzed albuterol vs. placebo in patients with early ALI. The primary endpoint will be the Pa02 / Fi02 on day 4 of treatment. Secondary outcome measures will be rate of progression to ALI and change in plasma biologic marker levels. This will be a first-of-its-kind trial to establish that patients with early ALI can be identified and treatment can be initiated prior to need for mechanical ventilation. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Following the paradigm of early goal-directed therapy for severe sepsis, clinical benefit may derive from identifying patients with early ALI and initiating treatment prior to the need for mechanical ventilation (and therefore prior to meeting current study entry criteria). Establishing evidence based clinical definition of early ALI will facilitate identification and risk stratification of subjects for enrollment in future clinical trials.

"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes. Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.              Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems.

"Exploring Clinically-relevant Image Retrieval for Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis  Project Summary All people with diabetes have the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy, a vision-threatening complication. Despite advances in diabetes care over the years, diabetic retinopathy remains a potentially devastating complication. Early detection and timely intervention or treatment can reduce the incidence of blindness due to diabetic retinopathy. Recent years, diagnosis based on digital retinal imaging has become an alternative to traditional face-to-face evaluation. The potential benefits of automated analysis of digital images of diabetic retinopathy have been shown in existing studies. However, no current computer-based systems can achieve the same level of performance of human experts. This proposal takes a new perspective in developing a computer-aided system for improved diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, by exploring novel computational methods for retrieving clinically-relevant images from archived database with prior diagnosis information, for a given novel image. Images are considered as being clinically relevant if they contain the same types of lesions with similar severity levels. Research and development on content-based retinal image search/retrieval is still in its infancy, with only limited success, largely due to the challenge of explicitly coding expert-knowledge into a computational algorithm. To deal with the challenge, this research project takes a distinctly different approach engaging a machine-learning approach, where a labeled image set is used to train a computer algorithm for analyzing other new images, with the focus of training on similarity in clinical relevance instead of image features. The training is enabled in part by the investigators' existing research on computer-based lesion simulation. One specific aim of the research is to build a content-based image retrieval system that can provide a clinician with instant reference to archival images that are clinically relevant to the image under diagnosis. This is an innovative way of exploiting vast expert knowledge hidden in libraries of previously-diagnosed digital images of diabetic retinopathy for a clinician's improved performance in diagnosis. Another specific aim is to build an image information management system for diabetic retinopathy that supports the deployment of the retrieval system in a realistic clinical setting. In addition to the retrieval system, the direct outcome of the research also includes automated evaluation algorithms for diabetic retinopathy images with potentially improved performance compared with existing methods. In particular, the design of the proposed work allows different configurations of the resultant system according to the specific needs of a physician.  Project Narrative This project develops a computer-based system for improved diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, a vision- threatening complication in people with diabetes. Early detection and timely intervention or treatment can reduce the incidence of blindness, and the computer-based system can potentially improve not only the speed but also the accuracy in diagnosing or screening patients with diabetic retinopathy.",Exploring Clinically-relevant Image Retrieval for Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis,8300746,R21HS019792,[' '],AHRQ,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R21,2012,151744,51931732,-0.020941178979415154
"Machine Learning Tools for Prognostication in Melanoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the study is to develop and validate a tool for reliable individualized prognostication of Stage III melanoma patients for use in the clinical setting.  Cutaneous melanoma is the sixth most common cancer in the United States, and its incidence rate is increasing faster than any other cancer. Nearly 69,000 new cases are expected be diagnosed in this country in 2010. While thin melanomas are typically cured with excision alone, thicker melanomas have a greater tendency to metastasize to the regional lymph nodes.  A diagnosis of Stage III melanoma is made if there is spread to the regional lymph nodes. Unfortunately, there is marked diversity in the natural history of Stage III melanoma, and outcomes within this group are extremely heterogeneous, with 5- year survival rates ranging from 23% to 87%. Similarly, treatment options range from intensive forms of systemic therapy to observation. Understanding patients' differences in clinical outcome is critical not only for calibrating therapeutic intensity to metastatic risk but also in the design and analysis of clinical trials.  There is a real void of reliable prognostic tools for Stage III melanoma. Based on novel machine learning approaches, the purpose of this study will be to develop and validate a reliable and individualized tool for prognostication of Stage III melanoma patients that can be used in the clinical setting.

"Assessing Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules With Electrical Impedance Measurements    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thyroid nodules are present in a large fraction of healthy individuals. Between 4% and 7% of the United States adult population has palpable thyroid nodules, and up to 50% of American women older than age 50 have nodules that can be depicted on ultrasound. The vast majority (>95%) of thyroid nodules are benign. However, cancer risk increases with male gender, nodule size, extremes of age (< 30 and > 60 years), underlying autoimmune disease, nodule growth, personal or family history of thyroid cancer, and radiation exposure. Ultrasound imaging and Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAB) remain the mainstays of thyroid nodule evaluation. Unfortunately, 25% of patients who ultimately undergo FNAB of a thyroid nodule have indeterminate cytology. Many of these patients will require at least partial thyroidectomy purely for the purpose of obtaining a definitive diagnosis. Given that only 30% of these will ultimately prove to be malignant on surgical pathology, the majority of these lobectomies could potentially be avoided if better non-invasive methods existed to evaluate indeterminate nodules. Electrical Impedance Scanning (EIS) has been previously investigated for non-invasive evaluation of thyroid nodules. The overall diagnostic accuracy of EIS was encouraging but not sufficient for routine clinical use. We have developed a modified approach termed here Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) that should have substantially higher sensitivity and specificity for this very purpose. When using REIS technology to examine the breast, we obtained initial results that are significantly better in all respects than those obtained with traditional EIS. We believe that REIS technology will similarly improve the assessment of thyroid nodules. REIS hold promise as a reproducible modality for the risk stratification of the many patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules. It is a new non- invasive modality that may help reduce the number of diagnostic lobectomies and would be welcomed by patients with non-diagnostic FNA results. The purpose of this application is to design, assemble, and test in a preliminary clinical study a unique REIS based device for the assessment of thyroid nodules.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to design, assemble, and test in technical and preliminary human studies a non-invasive, easy to use device for measuring Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) of FNA indeterminate thyroid nodules. We will assess the ability of this technology to accurately characterize these indeterminate nodules as benign or malignant prior to a ""diagnostic"" surgery.

"Sensory based CNS diagnostics for the clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is currently a significant gap that exists between fundamental neuroscience research and translation of the findings of that research into everyday practice. Experimental findings at the genetic, cellular, molecular and systems level often take a fairly long and frequently circuitous route to make an impact on a particular neurological disease or disorder. The goal of our work is to bridge the neuroscientific gap at the systems level of study by developing standardized sensory measures that can be not only utilized in clinical or clinical research settings, but can be directly correlated with the observations obtained directly from sensory cortex in non-human primates via high resolution imaging and extracellular recording. Successful development of an experimental model that iteratively evaluates the relationship of clinical measures and systemic CNS responses to specific mechanistic alterations will be quite significant. Such an evaluation of an individual's CNS status could be directly linked to systemic mechanistic deficiencies or alterations observed in animal experimentation.  Towards that goal, we have successfully designed and fabricated a tactile sensory diagnostic device. In parallel with that development, we designed a number of protocols - based on experimental neurophysiological findings from both our non human primate research and that of others - that could be rapidly and efficiently delivered (1-3 minutes) to a number of subject populations. The tactile diagnostic system that we have developed was conceptually designed to investigate differences in cortical information processing strategies between people with autism and people without. In this proposal we ask whether or not the strategy that we have devised for investigating a population with a neurodevelopmental disorder could be broadly applied to a number of neurological disorders. In other words, we consider the changes manifested by the neurodevelpmental disorder autism to be systemic, and if systemic cortical alterations occur in other neurological disorders, could they also be detected in the same manner?  Proof-of-concept studies in a number of clinical research areas demonstrated that these newly developed metrics were sensitive to systemic cortical alterations. One question that emerges from this data is that most of these neurological disorders result in some type of altered central sensitization, no matter what the cause - whether it be neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, pharmacological or trauma induced - in which there is a significant change in the balance between excitation and inhibition. This application proposes to determine if sensory perceptual metrics, similar to those that were used to successfully distinguish subjects with autism from healthy control populations (with 90% accuracy using SVM to assess the results of a 25 minute battery of 9 protocols), could be used to reliably distinguish - on an individual basis - subjects with neurological disorders that are not neurodevelopmental in nature. Towards this goal, we target subjects from one broad category of neurological disorders - chronic pain. More specifically, we will examine the differences and commonalities from observations of pain patients diagnosed with one of the following: fibromyalgia, vulvodynia, TMJD, IBS and migraine.        The overall goal of the proposed work is to investigate the utility of novel sensory-based methodologies that are currently being used in both basic and clinical research. Recently, utilizing state-of-the-art technology, we built a multi-site tactile stimulator that allows for investigation of central nervous system (CNS) health and advanced methods in sensory perceptual metrics. These metrics have been demonstrated to be sensitive to changes in centrally mediated mechanisms; and systemic alterations of cortical health (via neurodegenerational, neurodevelopmental, pharmacological or trauma induced changes) robustly change the measures. It is anticipated that clinicians will be able to utilize these measures to improve diagnostic performance and enable assessment of efficacy of treatment. The study itself will serve to validate the utility of a number of these measures in several types of pain, specifically fibromyalgia, TMJD, IBS, vulvodynia and migraine. The information from this study could aid in understanding centrally mediated mechanisms that undergo significant alterations with chronic pain.

"Outcomes of Bariatric Surgery among Patients with Bipolar Disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine how bariatric surgery affects psychiatric and metabolic outcomes among patients with bipolar disorder (BD). BD patients are at increased risk of obesity and suffer increased rates of obesity-related comorbidities. They have an estimated 25 years life lost, largely due to cardiovascular disease. There is an urgent need for knowledge about how best to treat obesity and mitigate associated comorbidities among bipolar disorder patients. Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for morbid obesity. Although BD patients suffer disproportionately from obesity, there is virtually no published data on how bariatric surgery affects psychiatric or metabolic course in this population. We propose a retrospective cohort study to examine psychiatric and metabolic outcomes during up to 3 years follow-up among all H100,000 morbidly obese adult patients (2000 BD, 13,000 major depressive disorder, 85,000 neither affective disorder) age 18-69 in Kaiser Permanente Northern California, between 2006 and 2009. Within the cohort, 5149 patients (171 BD, 1999 major depressive disorder, 2979 neither affective disorder) underwent bariatric surgery during the study period. We propose three aims: (1) Determine if predictors of referral to bariatric surgery, and of undergoing bariatric surgery, differ by affective disorder diagnosis (BD, major depressive disorder, neither); (2) Among n=2000 morbidly obese bipolar disorder patients who meet criteria for bariatric surgery, determine if bariatric surgery affects psychiatric course (risk of psychiatric hospitalization, outpatient psychiatric utilization); and (3) Among n=5149 patients who underwent bariatric surgery (171 BD, 1999 major depression, 2979 neither affective disorder), determine if affective disorder is associated with weight loss and metabolic outcomes (diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia). We will employ longitudinal data representation from the counterfactual statistical framework. Multiple linear regression will be employed for linear outcomes (weight loss, number of outpatient visits), and multiple logistic regression will be employed for dichotomous outcomes. This study will be the first to present data on outcomes of bariatric surgery among bipolar disorder patients. Current, there are no BD-specific data on which to base clinic decision making in this population. As the excess mortality in BD is largely due to cardiovascular disease, this study will provide essential information to guide clinical decision making for morbidly obese BD patients and their physicians.        People with bipolar disorder suffer higher risk of obesity and associated diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We propose to study how the most effective obesity therapy, bariatric surgery, affects psychiatric course, weight loss, and improvement in obesity-associated diseases (diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol) among bipolar disorder patients. Ours will be the first study of bariatric surgery outcomes in bipolar disorder, and will provided much-needed information to help bipolar disorder patients and their physicians make decisions about treatment options for morbid obesity.

"Coupled level set framework for retinal segmentation and atlasing in SD-OCT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Some eye diseases exhibit abnormalities or atrophy of the retina, which can impair vision and cause blindness. Certain other diseases traditionally thought to be exclusively associated with the brain are now known to be associated with changes or differences in the retina, which can also impair vision. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), an imaging device that is enabling modern in-vivo high-resolution studies of the retina, is rapidly becoming a key imaging technology both in ophthalmology, where clinical diagnoses and disease monitoring are experiencing a dramatic technical revolution, and also in neurology, where noninvasive retinal markers of brain disease are beginning to emerge. A key limitation in the current technology is the lack of detailed, accurate, and fully-automated analysis of the retinal layers that are observed throughout the retina in a typical three-dimensional spectral domain (SD)-OCT exam. Although tools are beginning to appear in association with commercial devices, they are currently lacking in sophistication and are not validated or standardized across manufacturers. This deficiency is problematic for both clinical and scientific application of SD-OCT since the measurements are not of known precision and are therefore not easily compared both in the same subject longitudinally and in population cross sections. The proposed research takes advantage of state-of-the-art algorithms that are emerging in both computer vision and medical imaging and will apply, adapt, and extend them to the specific application of layer segmentation in three-dimensional retinal SD-OCT. Advanced tools for population averaging in a normalized space will also be developed specifically for retinal SD-OCT data. The methods will be validated against manual segmentation and normalization on both normal subjects and patients experiencing retinal degeneration largely associated with thinning of selective layers of the retina. Scans of patients with diseases causing significant retinopathy such as cysts, detachment, or scarring will be evaluated, but further development beyond the present research is expected to be needed to properly segment and quantify such cases. The developed software will be developed within the open-source Java Image Science Toolkit (JIST) framework and released as open source software.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will develop software for the image analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the retina. Segmentation and quantification of the characteristics of nerve layers within the retina is expected to be of great use on both ophthalmology and neurology, where the retina can be a sensitive indicator of both vision and neurological problems or diseases.

"Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Applications     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract In this small business innovations research (SBIR) project, we present aiArt: Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine applications. aiArt (pronounced eye-art), with its automated image analysis tools and user-friendly telemedicine web-interface, will enable exponential expansion of diabetic retinopathy screenings, thus fulfilling a significant health need as the number of people with diabetes climbs over the years. Latino population is genetically more prone to diabetes. Factors such as lack of awareness, lack of insurance coverage, and lack of access to expert clinicians greatly increase this disparity population's vulnerability to blindness due to DR. The situation is particularly grim in Los Angeles County, where there is a backlog of several thousand patients waiting to see an ophthalmologist, causing very long appointment wait times (often over six months). To help reduce risk of vision loss in this population, we propose to use advanced image analysis algorithms in conjunction with existing telemedicine initiatives to enable faster screening, allow reprioritization of ophthalmologist appointments, and to provide patient education tools. Our automated image analysis algorithms represent cutting-edge of research in image processing, computer vision, and machine learning. The analysis engine will be closely integrated with simple, easy-to-use web-based telemedicine infrastructure provided by an existing, popular, telemedicine initiative, EyePACS.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative The proposed image analysis tools will greatly reduce the cost of diabetic retinopathy screening, and with its web and mobile phone accessible interface will drive an expansion of diabetic retinopathy screening, making it accessible to disparity populations (such as Latinos) which are not currently being screened due to socio-economic factors.

"Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence  Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence Translation of biomedical research into practice depends in part on the production of quality systematic reviews that synthesize available evidence. Unfortunately, about 20% of reviews are never completed. Of those that reach fruition, the average time to completion may be 2.4 years, with a reported maximum of 9 years. A major bottleneck occurs when teammates screen studies. In the first step, they independently identify provisionally eligible studies by reading the same set of perhaps thousands of titles and abstracts. To date, researchers have used supervised machine learning (ML) methods in an attempt to automate identification of eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, finding nonrandomized (NR) studies for inclusion in systematic reviews has yet to be addressed. This is an important problem because RCTs may be unlikely or even unethical for some research questions. Hypotheses. It is broadly hypothesized that (a) methods based on natural language processing and ML can be used to automatically identify topically relevant studies with a mix of NR designs eligible for inclusion in systematic reviews; and (b) machine performance can consistently reach current human standards with respect to identifying eligible studies. Aims. This research has three aims: (1) Compare the language that biomedical researchers use to describe their NR study designs with existing relevant vocabularies. Develop complementary terminologies for overlooked NR study designs to improve coverage of important vocabularies. Develop and validate a standalone terminology to support librarians who add free-text terms to expert searches. (2) Develop and compare procedures based on natural language processing and supervised ML methods to identify provisionally eligible NR studies that are topically relevant from a set of citations, including titles, abstracts, and metadata. Use terms for NR study designs to improve classification. (3) Generalize procedures developed under Aims 1 and 2 to select topically relevant studies with a mix of designs for provisional inclusion in several types of systematic reviews. Use contextual information in segments of full texts tagged for location to enrich feature vectors. Methods. Reference standards will be built from studies in published Cochrane reviews. Features will be extracted from citations and regions of full texts. Additionally, feature vectors will be enriched with terms for designs that researchers use in combination with terms extracted from major vocabularies. Model performance will be compared with respect to several measures, including mean recall and precision, for 10-fold cross-validations and validations on held-out test sets. Significance. The proposed research is significant because it will help support translation of biomedical research to improve human health. Moreover, developing procedures to identify NR studies is essential for the expeditious translation of a very large body of research.  Translation of biomedical research helps to improve public health by delivering the best available evidence to clinicians. This process depends in part on the production of systematic reviews of research.

"Clinical Image Retrieval: User needs assessment toolbox development & evaluation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Advances in digital imaging technologies have led to a substantial growth in the number of digital images being created and stored in hospitals, medical systems, and on the Internet in recent years. Effective medical image retrieval systems can play an important role in teaching, research, diagnosis and treatment. Images were historically retrieved using text-based methods. The quality of annotations associated with images can reduce the effectiveness of text-based image retrieval. Despite recent advances, purely content- based image retrieval techniques lag significantly behind their textual counterparts in their ability to capture the semantic essence of the user's query. Preliminary research suggests that a more promising approach is to adaptively combine these complementary techniques to suit the user and their information needs. However, for these approaches to succeed, the researcher needs to enhance her computational skills in addition to acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the relevant clinical domain. This Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) grant application describes a training and career development plan that will allow the candidate, an NLM postdoctoral fellow in Medical Informatics at Oregon Health & Science University to achieve these objectives. The training component will be carried out under the mentorship of Dr. W. Hersh with Dr. Gorman (user studies).

"Automated image-based biomarker computation tools for diabetic retinopathy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this STTR project, we present EyeMark, a set of tools for automated computation of biomarkers for diabetic retinopathy using retinal image photographs. Specifically, we will develop tools for computation of microaneurysm (MA) appearance and disappearance rates (jointly known as turnover rates) for use as a biomarker in monitoring progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR). The availability of a reliable image-based biomarker will have high positive influence on various aspects of DR care, including screening, monitoring progression, drug discovery and clinical research. There is ample published evidence that MA turnover rates are a good predictor of likelihood of progression to more severe retinopathy, establishing MA turnover as an excellent biomarker for diabetic retinopathy. Measuring this quantity involves two steps: careful alignment of current and baseline images, and marking of individual MAs. This process is very time consuming and prone to error, if done by entirely by human graders. The primary goal of this project is to overcome the above limitations by automating both the steps involved in MA turnover measurement: accurate image registration, and MA detection. We will develop end-too-end desktop software for automated computation of MA turnover and also provide intuitive visualization tools for clinicians to more effectively monitor diabetic retinopathy progression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed tool will greatly enhance the clinical care available to diabetic retinopathy patients by providing an automated tool for computation of a biomarker in a non-invasive manner. This will enable identification of patients who are more likely to progress to severe retinopathy, thus helping prevent vision loss in such patients by timely intervention. Early identification is especially important in face of long backlog of diabetic patients waiting for an eye examination, and the fact that 90% of vision loss can be saved by early identification. The availability of an effective biomarker will also positively influence the drug discovery process by facilitating early and reliable determination of biological efficacy of potential new therapies.              The proposed tool will greatly enhance the clinical care available to diabetic retinopathy patients by providing an automated tool for computation of a biomarker in a non-invasive manner.

"Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research  Project Summary (Abstract):  Since the introduction of Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine in 1796, vaccines have proven invaluable for their ability to stimulate the immune system and to confer protection against pathogenic organisms. Progress in modern vaccine research has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of vaccine-related papers in the published literature. It has become increasingly challenging to identify and annotate vaccine data from this large and diverse literature which no one scientist or team can fully master. Although vaccine databases exist that emphasize commercialized vaccines, no public central repository is available to store research data concerning commercial vaccines, vaccines in clinical trials, or vaccine candidates in early stages of development, in a fashion that render such data available for advanced analyses. To fill this need, we have developed VIOLIN (http://www.violinet.org), a web-based database system for annotation, storage, and analysis of published vaccine data. An ontology represents consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations, with associated definitions which are logically formulated in such a way as to promote automated reasoning. A bottleneck of vaccine research and further VIOLIN development is the lack of a vaccine ontology, which in turn makes a significant obstacle for vaccine data standardization, retrieval, integration, and advanced analysis and prediction. Our goal is to develop the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and apply it to efficient vaccine literature mining and analysis of protective immune mechanisms. We will focus on two model pathogens: Escherichia coli and Brucella species. This project contains three specific aims: (1) develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO), and apply it to establish a vaccine knowledgebase and to promote vaccine data integration and query through Semantic Web. The VO development will be achieved through collaboration with vaccine researchers, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Initiative, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO); (2) develop a VO-based natural language processing (NLP) system and apply it for more efficient retrieval of Brucella and E. coli vaccine information, automated annotation of journal articles with VO terms, and VO improvement. This task will be achieved by collaboration with the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). (3) analyze and predict vaccine targets and protective immune networks attributable to the interactions between host and vaccine. This will be achieved mainly by VO-based literature mining and a novel genome- and literature-based statistical methodology. This project will be implemented by a strong collaborative team and supported from a large user community. The Vaccine Ontology and its applications to literature mining and for studying protective immunity against Brucella spp. and E. coli will lay a strong foundation for further advanced informatics research on vaccines against infectious diseases in the post-genomics and information era.  Narrative: Vaccines stimulate the immune system and confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms. A bottleneck of vaccine research is the lack of an ontology (consensus- based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations) to ensure consistency of literature curation and support automated reasoning.

"Automated Web-Based Behavioral Diagnostics of Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade. A critical goal of Alzheimer's disease research is to improve current methods of diagnosis so that patients can be identified sooner and, therefore, obtain greater advantage from available therapies. The major goal of this project is to develop and validate an automated, web-based method for early diagnosis of cognitive decline and memory loss. We will build on current research that has demonstrated a clear link between performance on the Visual Paired- Comparison Task (VPC) and diagnosis of MCI, and we will extend the impact of this finding by developing a suite of software tools and analysis methods that will improve the accuracy and extend the accessibility of cognitive diagnostics with a web-based VPC task that can be widely deployed. Although the VPC task is promising as a diagnostic aid, clinical application is severely limited by the need to use an eye tracker to precisely monitor subjects' eye movements. Unfortunately, eye trackers are expensive, require trained personnel, and are not widely available. However, our preliminary findings show that it is possible to produce picture examination behavior that is similar to eye-movements, using modified versions of the VPC task that could be administered by anyone, on any computer with an internet connection. In addition, powerful machine learning techniques from computer science can help accurately analyze and diagnose the resulting behavior. An important contribution from this work will be the possibility of predicting oncoming cognitive decline in MCI patients sooner than is now possible, that is, at a time when the nervous system is less compromised and more likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. In support of this objective, we propose three aims: 1) Develop and investigate appropriate representation of eye movement characteristics and corresponding machine learning-based classification techniques for effective identification of the patient status, 2) Develop and validate a web-based version of the VPC task, and 3) explore the feasibility of our task as an automatic screening instrument for the general elderly population. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to dramatically alter the current practice of clinical translational research as well as the current methods used for diagnosing cognitive deficits. This would enable thousands and potentially millions of patients and potential research subjects to take the test as part of their routine checkup, requiring nothing more than a computer with an internet connection.

"Hand Sensorimotor Function and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The median nerve is susceptible to compression in the wrist, leading to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is the most common compression neuropathy and have an immense impact on national health care, worker productivity, and quality of life. Despite its high prevalence and public health cost, our understanding of CTS is limited, and the management of CTS awaits improvement. The central notion of this project is that hand sensorimotor function is sensitive to peripheral median neuropathy and that the central nervous system is affected by CTS, causing the associated sensorimotor deficit. We will investigate this notion with quantifiable sensorimotor data from novel biomechanical and neurophysiological studies. This project has three aims consisting of biomechanical, neurophysiological and translational research. The first aim is to investigate CTS-induced pathokinematic and pathokinetic performance using dexterous manual tasks of thumb opposition, reach-to-pinch, precision grip, and finger pressing. The second aim is to investigate the neurophysiological implications of chronic peripheral neuropathy (i.e., CTS) on the central nervous system by evaluating corticomuscular coupling and stretch reflex. The third aim is to identify novel biomechanical and neurophysiological markers for CTS cases using machine learning and classification algorithms. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of CTS and aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder. More generally, CTS as a chronic neuropathy serves as an effective model to study sensorimotor mechanisms of the peripheral and central nervous systems. In addition, the methodology developed in this project is applicable to other neuromuscular disorders.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly. One of the distinct consequences of carpal tunnel syndrome is that patients experience inexplicable dropping of objects and clumsiness while performing simple daily tasks. In this project, we propose to study the sensorimotor deficit using novel biomechanical and neurophysiological experiments. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and manifestations of carpal tunnel syndrome. This project is clinically translational to aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder.

"Improving Prematurity-related Respiratory Outcomes at Vanderbilt (IMPROV)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease that impacts the pulmonary and overall health of more than 10,000 infants in the US each year. The long-term objective of this Clinical Research Center (CRC) is translation of biochemical, genetic and bioinformatics research into innovative interventions that improve outcomes of extremely preterm infants at risk for long- term pulmonary morbidity. Our proposal focuses specifically on the urea cycle-nitric oxide (UC-NO) and glutathione (GSH) pathways as pivotal and interrelated mechanisms in the response of the developing lung to the extrauterine environment. Overall hypotheses: (1) Biochemical immaturity and functional genetic variation in the UC-NO and GSH pathways modulate the BPD phenotype spectrum; (2) The duration and degree of NO insufficiency and free radical excess predicts BPD severity and correlates with pulmonary morbidity after NICU discharge. To investigate our hypothesis, our CRC will enroll 250 infants with birthweights 510-1250 grams and follow the survivors through 1 year of life. Our hypothesis invokes an immature hepatic and gut synthetic capacity to make citrulline and GSH, functional genetic variations in the UC-NO and GSH pathways, nutritional deficiencies and the physiologic and environmental stress of preterm birth. The resultant NO deficiency and free radical excess alters pulmonary vascular and alveolar development. Our biomarker discovery concept includes (a) collection of plasma, urine, red blood cells, DNA and tracheal aspirates for measurements of NO and GSH precursor sufficiency, production of NO metabolites and GSH, functional genetic variants in these pathways, and biomarkers of in vivo oxidative stress and (b) validation of these biomarkers for diagnosis and long term prognosis of patients with BPD. A bioinformatics approach using machine learning and predictive modeling has been developed for respiratory phenotyping and risk stratification at 36 weeks and 40 weeks postmenstrual age and at 12 months after hospital discharge. Accomplishment of these goals will promote novel clinical trials design to test new therapies to prevent BPD and improve long term pulmonary health of infants born preterm. (End of Abstract)      RELEVANCE: Each year in the US, more than 10,000 premature infants develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease associated with prolonged and recurrent hospitalizations and lifelong alterations in lung function.

"Toward Individually-tailored Medicine: Probabilistic Models of Cerebral Aneurysms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding, both from incidental discovery on imaging studies and on autopsy; it is estimated that anywhere from 1-6% of the American population will develop this problem. Unfortunately, while our ability to detect ICAs has grown, our fundamental understanding of this disease entity remains lacking and significant debate continues in regards to its treatment. Given the high degree of mortality and comorbidity associated with ruptured intracranial aneurysms, it is imperative that new insights and approaches be developed to inform medical decision making involving ICAs. Thus, the objective of this proposal is the creation of an informatics infrastructure to help elucidate the genesis, progression, and treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Building from our efforts from the previous R01, a set of technical developments is outlined to transform the array of information routinely collected from clinical as- sessment of ICA patients into a Bayesian belief network (BBN) that models the disease. First, we evolve the concept of a phenomenon-centric data model (PCDM) as the basis for (temporally) organizing clinically-derived observations, enabling the model to be associated with processing pipelines that can identify and transform targeted variables from the content of clinical data sources. Through these pipelines, specific values in free- text reports (radiology, surgery, pathology, discharge summaries) and imaging studies will be automatically extracted into a scientific-quality database. Second, the PCDM schema for ICAs is mapped to a Bayesian belief network: the linkage between the PCDM and BBN allows automatic updating of the network and its progressive refinement from a growing dataset. The BBN's topology will be determined by clinical experts and conditional probabilities computed from the extracted clinical data. A basic graphical user interface (GUI) will permit users to interact with the BBN, aiding in medical decision making tasks. The GUI will allow a clinician to pose questions from either a set of common clinical queries or to create new queries: loading a patient's medical record into this application will automatically populate BBN variables with extracted information (i.e., from the pipelines). Each technical component of this proposal will be evaluated in a laboratory setting. In addition, the BBN will be tested for its predictive capabilities and compared to other statistical models to assess its potential in guiding ICA treatment. This proposal leverages a clinical collaboration with the UCLA Division of Interventional Neuroradiology, a leader in ICA research and treatment. A combined dataset of 2,000 retrospective and prospective subjects will be used to create the ICA database and BBN. Data collection will encompass a comprehensive set of variables including clinical presentation, imaging assessment (morphology, hemodynamics), histopathology, gene expression, treatment, and outcomes. We will additionally leverage the NIH/NINDS Human Genetic DNA and Cell Line Repository for additional ICA-related data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding on routine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) neuro-imaging studies. The associated mortality rate and comorbidity resultant from ruptured ICAs are extreme: subarachnoid hemorrhage causes 50% of individuals to die within one month of rupture, and more than one third of survivors develop major neurological deficits. Hence, the focus of this re- search is the creation of a comprehensive research database for ICA patients, using the spectrum of data routinely acquired in the diagnosis and treatment of the problem; from this database, a new probabilistic model of ICAs will be created, providing new insights into the disease and its optimal treatment for a given individual.

"Real-Time MRI Motion Correction System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MOTIVATION - Motion remains one of the most frequent contributors to image artifacts in MR studies.  The motion susceptibility of MRI is well-known and has spawned a number of elegant navigation techniques.  These methods, however, are tailored to specific MR acquisitions that require modified k-space trajectories or the acquisition of additional MR data, and most are unable to correct certain types of motion, for example, through-plane motion.  Moreover, motion correction has been focused on specific families of sequences, but no generally applicable approach currently exists.  Certain patient populations, such as pediatric or geriatric patients, are more likely to move than others.  In pediatric imaging, anesthesia is used to control motion, adding substantially to exam costs and patient risks.  A sequence-independent, autonomous and prospective motion correction system could greatly improve image quality for a wide spectrum of MR examinations.  For pediatric imaging, in particular, we anticipate reduced reliance on anesthesia to control patient motion.  AIMS - We will be focusing on three independent specific aims (carried out in parallel and completed within 4 years), with corresponding subaims that we believe are important for establishing the technical/scientific merit and to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed R&D efforts for our real-time adaptive motion correction approach.  Specifically, these aims are:  (1) to develop and evaluate a coil-mounted MR-compatible tracking device for routine clinical use; (2) to integrate pose tracking into real-time MRI; and (3) to validate our real-time motion correction system in volunteers and patients.  METHODS -In Aim 1 we will improve the methods for computer-vision-based pose estimation inside an MR scanner and build an MR-compatible coil-mounted pose tracker that can be used in clinical routine examinations.  In Aim 2 we will focus on reducing the latency between pose changes happening and the MR scanner reacting to these pose changes, and on building a software library for the MR pulse sequence development that allows one to implement real-time motion correction into all MR pulse sequences.  In Aim 3 we will perform a thorough evaluation of our system on 60 volunteers (30 adults and 30 children) and 120 patients (80 adults and 40 children).  SIGNIFICANCE - The impact of our technology has several facets.  First, it will improve patient care by reducing the number of MR images with compromised quality because of motion artifacts.  Especially because of the increasing reliance on MR Images as a primary means of diagnosis, this will reduce the number of misdiagnoses.  Secondly, this technology will help to lower the high national spending on imaging by dramatically improving the efficiency of MRI scanners.  Finally, it will improve patient comfort by reducing the need for repeat sequences, as well as reduce the necessity of sedation aimed at keeping the patient still.  Overall, this technology will have a significant impact on MRI both in clinical practice and basic science research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Synopsis Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.  This is not only of increasing concern due to the aging population and its associated diseases, but also in children and patients who are simply too sick to remain still during an exam.  This proposal aims to build an optical tracking system and methods to adapt MRI pulse sequences to changes in patient pose in real time.  The project leverages on previous work from an R21 project in which a prototype system was successfully built.  Specifically, the aims are to (i) introduce innovative improvements to the existing prototype, making the system suitable for use in clinical routine, (ii) modify the optical tracking system to be compatible with multiple MR sequences, and (iii) perform clinical evaluation.  Our real-time technique is a unique and innovative solution that will improve MRI image quality and thus patient care, and will address the escalating burden of imaging costs on the health care system.

"Noninvasive Assessment of Neuromuscular Disease using Electrical Impedance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuromuscular disorders include a wide group of conditions ranging from relatively mild focal problems, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, to severe, generalized diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Current methods for evaluating these disorders remain limited to a variety of tests and procedures that are either invasive or remarkably qualitative in nature. One newer technique, electrical impedance myography (EIM), offers the prospect of obtaining quantitative data on muscle condition painlessly and non-invasively. However, no commercial devices specifically tailored for EIM use exist, with nearly all previous EIM work relying upon off-the-shelf bioimpedance devices designed for ""whole-body"" rather than single-muscle assessment. In Phase 1 of this SBIR, Convergence Medical Devices, Inc (CMD) developed an initial prototype system to test proof-of-principle innovative concepts in circuit design and data acquisition to provide highly sensitive and accurate data at an extended frequency range (out to 10 MHz) and over multiple angles relative to the major muscle fiber direction. This work was followed by supplemental work that produced the first hand-held device with robust electronics capable of similar measurements with a detachable, interchangeable electrode array. In this 3-year Phase 2 SBIR, CMD proposes to further refine that technology so as to assist in disease diagnosis and for following disease progression, with a specific focus on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In Aim 1 of the proposed grant, testing of multiple electrode array designs will be performed on a group of normal subjects and those with ALS to determine which electrode array designs offer the greatest reproducibility and ability to discriminate healthy from diseased individuals. In Aim 2, the device and the 3 ""best"" array designs identified in Aim 1 will be tested in 30 ALS patients, 30 patients with syndromes mimicking ALS (e.g., polyradiculopathy and motor-predominant neuropathy), and 30 subjects with suspected/possible ALS to determine the single best array design for diagnosis and to determine its sensitivity and specificity. This study will take place at CMD and four external sites and will be managed by the Northeast ALS trials Consortium (NEALS), the premier organization for overseeing clinical trials in ALS. In Aim 3, the 30 suspected/possible ALS patients recruited in SA2 and 30 additional suspected/possible ALS patients will be assessed monthly using EIM and the 3 arrays identified in SA1. All subjects will also undergo standard measurements of disease progression including handheld dynamometry, ALS Functional Rating Scale, and spirometry. The best array design for assessing disease progression will be identified and compared to conventional markers of disease progression to determine EIM's sensitivity to disease status. Thus, at the conclusion of this research program, we anticipate having developed and vigorously tested an EIM device and associated electrode designs that together will serve as a powerful new diagnostic and monitoring tool for neuromuscular disease.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone. In this study, Convergence Medical Devices, in collaboration with neurologists at several medical centers, will develop and test a new device based on the concept of electrical impedance myography, a technique that offers the promise of rapid and accurate disease assessment. With the completion of this study, a new, painless tool will be developed and studied that will assist in individual patient care and will speed drug testing in clinical trials in diseases ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and muscular dystrophy to radiculopathy and polyneuropathy.              The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone.

"Access to Liver Transplantation for Patients with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic liver disease that has no treatment and is an otherwise fatal disease without liver transplantation. Patients with PSC face unique complications as compared to other patients with end-stage liver disease, including cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), cholangitis from biliary strictures, and complications such as colon cancer from concomitant inflammatory bowel disease. The current model for allocation of livers, instituted on February 27th, 2002, relies on a patient's Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, which accounts for a patient's serum INR, creatinine, and bilirubin. The MELD score places more weight on the INR and creatinine, although in patients with PSC the bilirubin is disproportionately elevated. This fact, along with the fact that complications such as CCA are not captured by the MELD data elements, leads us to believe that the MELD score may place patients with PSC at a survival disadvantage. If this is true, then this may serve as a basis for a policy change in how livers are allocated. For patients with PSC on the waitlist, their risk of death may be higher for two reasons. Either the risk of death for a given MELD score is higher for patients with PSC, or in patients with PSC, the MELD score rises more slowly, making patients less likely to receive a transplant and thereby exposed for a longer duration to the risks of clinical deterioration and removal from the waitlist. Our first aim will address this primary research question in three ways. We will develop two Cox proportional hazard models, one accounting for all of a patient's MELD scores while on the waitlist, and another adjusting only for MELD at listing. We will also perform logistic regression to evaluate the clinically important outcome of death vs. transplant. Our second aim will serve to determine the frequencies with which potential liver transplant recipients are removed from the waitlist due to clinical deterioration among those in whom the reasons for withdrawal are unspecified in UNOS data. By collecting patient level data from individual transplant centers, we will be able to calculate the extent of this outcome misclassification and thereby guide quantitative sensitivity analyses of our primary models in Aim I. Lastly, we will evaluate whether introduction of the MELD system for liver allocation was associated with changes in rates of living donor liver transplantation among patients with PSC relative to corresponding rates among patients without PSC. This analysis is needed as differential rates of referral for living donor transplant among patients with and without PSC could affect the extent to which diagnosis may influence the outcomes in Aim I. The proposed research project will be in the context of the applicant working towards a Masters of Science in Clinical Epidemiology, whereby didactic learning in the classroom, focusing on fundamentals of epidemiology, study design, and statistical and analytic methods of research will enhance and guide the research process of the applicant. The long-term objectives of the applicant for this project are to collect and analyze the data, prepare manuscripts for publication, and build upon the data as part of a future application for a K award.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The allocation of organs for liver transplantation has major public health implications in that decisions must be made as to how we allocate a scarce resource. It is critical that we practice within a system that is equitable, and does not disadvantage one group of patients as a result of their disease status. If it is found that patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis are disadvantaged by the current liver allocation system, then this will form a foundation for which large-scale policy changes are considered to bring about a fairer system of organ transplantation.           Project Narrative/Relevance The allocation of organs for liver transplantation has major public health implications in that decisions must be made as to how we allocate a scarce resource.

"Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Translation of biomedical research into practice depends in part on the production of quality systematic reviews that synthesize available evidence. Unfortunately, about 20% of reviews are never completed. Of those that reach fruition, the average time to completion may be 2.4 years, with a reported maximum of 9 years. A major bottleneck occurs when teammates screen studies. In the first step, they independently identify provisionally eligible studies by reading the same set of perhaps thousands of titles and abstracts. To date, researchers have used supervised machine learning (ML) methods in an attempt to automate identification of eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, finding nonrandomized (NR) studies for inclusion in systematic reviews has yet to be addressed. This is an important problem because RCTs may be unlikely or even unethical for some research questions. Hypotheses. It is broadly hypothesized that (a) methods based on natural language processing and ML can be used to automatically identify topically relevant studies with a mix of NR designs eligible for inclusion in systematic reviews; and (b) machine performance can consistently reach current human standards with respect to identifying eligible studies. Aims. This research has three aims: (1) Compare the language that biomedical researchers use to describe their NR study designs with existing relevant vocabularies. Develop complementary terminologies for overlooked NR study designs to improve coverage of important vocabularies. Develop and validate a standalone terminology to support librarians who add free-text terms to expert searches. (2) Develop and compare procedures based on natural language processing and supervised ML methods to identify provisionally eligible NR studies that are topically relevant from a set of citations, including titles, abstracts, and metadata. Use terms for NR study designs to improve classification. (3) Generalize procedures developed under Aims 1 and 2 to select topically relevant studies with a mix of designs for provisional inclusion in several types of systematic reviews. Use contextual information in segments of full texts tagged for location to enrich feature vectors. Methods. Reference standards will be built from studies in published Cochrane reviews. Features will be extracted from citations and regions of full texts. Additionally, feature vectors will be enriched with terms for designs that researchers use in combination with terms extracted from major vocabularies. Model performance will be compared with respect to several measures, including mean recall and precision, for 10-fold cross-validations and validations on held-out test sets. Significance. The proposed research is significant because it will help support translation of biomedical research to improve human health. Moreover, developing procedures to identify NR studies is essential for the expeditious translation of a very large body of research.           Translation of biomedical research helps to improve public health by delivering the best available evidence to clinicians. This process depends in part on the production of systematic reviews of research.

"Early Acute Lung Injury: Prospective Evaluation Prior to Respiratory Failure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Acute lung injury (ALI) is a syndrome of acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to pulmonary and non-pulmonary insults and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite two decades of targeted investigation by the NHLBI, little is known about ALI prior to progression to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Accordingly, the aims of this research plan are to: 1) prospectively identify independent predictors of progression to ALI requiring mechanical ventilation and establish a clinical definition of early ALI; 2) evaluate the pathogenetic role of biologic markers of inflammation and lung injury and their value for refining risk stratification of patients at risk for progression to ALI, and 3) test the potential therapeutic value of an aerosolized beta-2 agonist in patients with early ALI. In SPECIFIC AIM 1 will identify cases of potential early ALI by screening chest radiographs of all adult emergency department and medicine service admissions. Patients admitted to the hospital with bilateral opacities on chest radiograph not due to isolated left atrial hypertension will be followed for progression to ALI during their hospitalization. Clinical characteristics (demographics, diagnoses, comorbidities, vital signs, and Borg dyspnea scores) will be recorded for the first 72 hours of admission. Independent predictors of progression to ALI will be determined by multivariate logistic regression and incorporated into a clinical definition of early ALI. In SPECIFIC AIM 2, plasma levels of biomarkers (IL-8, sTNFr-1, vWF, ICAM-1, SP-D and RAGE) representing distinct pathways contributing to acute lung injury will be measured at time 0 and 24 hours after study enrollment. Biomarkers will be analyzed by multivariate regression analysis to assess their value for stratifying patients at risk for progression to ALI and provide mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of early ALI. In SPECIFIC AIM 3 I will conduct a randomized clinical trial of aerosoUzed albuterol vs. placebo in patients with early ALI. The primary endpoint will be the Pa02 / Fi02 on day 4 of treatment. Secondary outcome measures will be rate of progression to ALI and change in plasma biologic marker levels. This will be a first-of-its-kind trial to establish that patients with early ALI can be identified and treatment can be initiated prior to need for mechanical ventilation. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Following the paradigm of early goal-directed therapy for severe sepsis, clinical benefit may derive from identifying patients with early ALI and initiating treatment prior to the need for mechanical ventilation (and therefore prior to meeting current study entry criteria). Establishing evidence based clinical definition of early ALI will facilitate identification and risk stratification of subjects for enrollment in future clinical trials.

"Machine-Learning Approach to Label-free Detection of new Bacterial Pathogens DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We appreciate the time and effort spent by all the reviewers, and we are grateful for the useful comments and provided suggestions. We have carefully reviewed the critiques and we are happy to see that the panel was receptive to our proposal. The reviewers expressed three major concerns in the summary statement: (1) although the investigating team is well qualified our history of collaboration is short; (2) details regarding the practical constraints of the BARDOT system are lacking; (3) the machine learning techniques employed in the project are considered fairly standard.  Below we briefly discuss the reviewers comments and indicate how we have changed our revised application to address the critique.  (1) Dr. Dundar moved from industry to academia in the fall of 2008, at which point Dr. Rajwa (one of the original inventors of BARDOT) and Dr. Dundar began their collaboration on new approaches to the problem of non-exhaustively defined classes in phenotypic screening. This scientific partnership immediately produced interesting results, and at the time of submission of the original application, Dr. Dundar and Dr. Rajwa had their first manuscript under review. The approach presented in the original proposal was tested and the results were submitted to the ACM 15th Annual SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD'09), which is the largest and one of the most respected conferences in this field. The manuscript was accepted after a full peer review as one of the 50 regular papers selected from 551 submissions [20]. Following the proposal submission, research efforts continued and produced yet another approach to the problem described in this grant application. The preliminary findings are reported in a new manuscript which is currently under review [4].  (2) We rewrote the background and research methods sections of our proposal to include information re- quested by the reviewers regarding practical aspects of the BARDOT system, such as accuracy issues (Section D.3.2), frequency of encountering new, unknown classes (Section B.3.1), and validation (Section D.3.1).  (3) The problem of phenotypic screening and classification of bacteria can be defined within exhaustive (stan- dard) or non-exhaustive learning frameworks. Although we agree that the implementation of an exhaustive clas- sification approach for BARDOT does require only fairly standard tools, the problem of the non-exhaustive nature of training libraries cannot be addressed by straightforward use of any textbook-level technique. In fact, the presence of non-exhaustively defined set of classes violates basic assumptions for most supervised learning systems. The issue of non-exhaustively defined classes is the major obstacle for application of machine learning in phenotypic analysis since the number of possible phenotypes may be infinite. In our original proposal we argued that learning with a non-exhaustively defined set of classes remains a very challenging problem, and presented evidence demonstrating that simple extensions of standard techniques cannot provide an acceptable solution. Subsequently, we proposed a new approach based on Bayesian simulation of classes and showed that preliminary results outperformed benchmark techniques [4].  Although these initial results looked promising, we did not consider the described preliminary algorithms final and definitive, and we do not believe that at this point we are able to provide an exact algorithmic solution to this complex problem. If we were able to do that, it would mean that we had already accomplished all the grant goals. The very essence of the proposed research is finding the answer to the defined problem, and the answer will remain unknown until after the work has been done. However, positive reviews and an acceptance of our work by KDD'09 conference judges, tell us that we are heading in the right direction.  In the amended version of this application we propose a modified Bayesian approach based on Wishart priors (Section D.2.3). The algorithm creates new classes on the fly and evaluates maximum likelihood with the updated set of classes, gradually improving detection accuracy for future samples. We believe that this offers a substantial improvement over the previous method. Consequently, the preliminary results in Section C are updated to reflect our progress. Since the modified technique allows for classification with non-exhaustive and exhaustive sets using the same algorithm, we consolidated the previous specific aims 3 and 5 into one in the revised application.

"Exploring Clinically-relevant Image Retrieval for Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All people with diabetes have the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy, a vision-threatening complication. Despite advances in diabetes care over the years, diabetic retinopathy remains a potentially devastating complication. Early detection and timely intervention or treatment can reduce the incidence of blindness due to diabetic retinopathy. Recent years, diagnosis based on digital retinal imaging has become an alternative to traditional face-to-face evaluation. The potential benefits of automated analysis of digital images of diabetic retinopathy have been shown in existing studies. However, no current computer-based systems can achieve the same level of performance of human experts. This application takes a new perspective in developing a computer-aided system for improved diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, by exploring novel computational methods for retrieving clinically-relevant images from archived database with prior diagnosis information, for a given novel image. Images are considered as being clinically relevant if they contain the same types of lesions with similar severity levels. Research and development on content-based retinal image search/retrieval is still in its infancy, with only limited success, largely due to the challenge of explicitly coding expert-knowledge into a computational algorithm. To deal with the challenge, this research project takes a distinctly different approach engaging a machine-learning approach, where a labeled image set is used to train a computer algorithm for analyzing other new images, with the focus of training on similarity in clinical relevance instead of image features. The training is enabled in part by the investigators' existing research on computer-based lesion simulation. One specific aim of the research is to build a content-based image retrieval system that can provide a clinician with instant reference to archival images that are clinically relevant to the image under diagnosis. This is an innovative way of exploiting vast expert knowledge hidden in libraries of previously-diagnosed digital images of diabetic retinopathy for a clinician's improved performance in diagnosis. Another specific aim is to build an image information management system for diabetic retinopathy that supports the deployment of the retrieval system in a realistic clinical setting. In addition to the retrieval system, the direct outcome of the research also includes automated evaluation algorithms for diabetic retinopathy images with potentially improved performance compared with existing methods. In particular, the design of the proposed work allows different configurations of the resultant system according to the specific needs of a physician.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project develops a computer-based system for improved diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, a vision- threatening complication in people with diabetes. Early detection and timely intervention or treatment can reduce the incidence of blindness, and the computer-based system can potentially improve not only the speed but also the accuracy in diagnosing or screening patients with diabetic retinopathy.           This project develops a computer-based system for improved diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, a vision- threatening complication in people with diabetes.

"PATHOLOGY MISS RATE RISK REDUCTION IN DIAGNOSTIC SMALL BOWEL CAPSULE ENDOSCOPY    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Well trained, experienced gastroenterologists in academic and high volume settings can reliably recognize 97% of pathologies in Capsule Endoscopy (CE) video. However, community physicians and infrequent users may miss up to 20%. The end goal of our proposed new line of research is to develop clinical software that provides automatic decision support to physicians who are trying to declare that a patient is pathology free or has a certain disease process. The risk for the physician - and their patients - is that of a less than optimal clinical outcome due to:  1) missing a lesion/pathology in the video and putting the patient at risk of developing a more serious condition over time, or  2) mistakenly ""identifying"" a pathology that is not present and thus subjecting the patient to unnecessary further diagnostic or surgical procedures.  The research aims in this proposal will enable Ikona to create a pathology prioritization image processing module. Implementing modern machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Adaboost methodologies together with proprietary image feature analysis, this technology will assign a probability metric to every frame in the image sequence for specific pathology (lesions, ulcers, bleeding, etc) and the major landmarks in the GI tract (ileo-cecal valve, pyloric valve etc.). Filtering and sorting endoscopy image data will be done such that the images with the highest probability of containing pathology will be presented to the reviewer first.  This pathology prioritized sequencing is not intended to replace the clinician in the workflow, but rather to allow the clinician to focus more time on frames with a higher potential of containing pathology. Often times, clinically significant pathology may only be present in a single frame. A single ""pathological"" frame in the middle of a 50,000 frame sequence can easily be overlooked by a novice reviewer or a reviewer whose attention is temporarily distracted. With our proposed pathology prioritization, that single pathological frame will be identified and sorted near the beginning of the image sequence thus greatly increasing the likelihood of detection by the reviewer.  Specifically for Phase I, we plan to investigate and develop different algorithms for classifying image frames and recognizing pathological and normal frames, and, algorithms for ranking frames by severity of pathology. Following the implementation of a working prototype, we will further test the clinical utility of these algorithms with human clinical capsule endoscopy videos.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Capsule Endoscopy (CE) is widely used for assessing the small intestine in obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. Experienced gastroenterologists miss 2-3% of pathologies in part due to fatigue from reviewing 50,000 frames per CE video. Less experienced reviewers miss up to 20%. We propose to reduce the risk of false negatives by developing clinical image processing software to automatically re-order the CE video frames, ranking them by the probability they contain pathology.           Capsule Endoscopy (CE) is widely used for assessing the small intestine in obscure gastrointestinal bleeding.

"Outcomes of Bariatric Surgery among Patients with Bipolar Disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine how bariatric surgery affects psychiatric and metabolic outcomes among patients with bipolar disorder (BD). BD patients are at increased risk of obesity and suffer increased rates of obesity-related comorbidities. They have an estimated 25 years life lost, largely due to cardiovascular disease. There is an urgent need for knowledge about how best to treat obesity and mitigate associated comorbidities among bipolar disorder patients. Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for morbid obesity. Although BD patients suffer disproportionately from obesity, there is virtually no published data on how bariatric surgery affects psychiatric or metabolic course in this population. We propose a retrospective cohort study to examine psychiatric and metabolic outcomes during up to 3 years follow-up among all H100,000 morbidly obese adult patients (2000 BD, 13,000 major depressive disorder, 85,000 neither affective disorder) age 18-69 in Kaiser Permanente Northern California, between 2006 and 2009. Within the cohort, 5149 patients (171 BD, 1999 major depressive disorder, 2979 neither affective disorder) underwent bariatric surgery during the study period. We propose three aims: (1) Determine if predictors of referral to bariatric surgery, and of undergoing bariatric surgery, differ by affective disorder diagnosis (BD, major depressive disorder, neither); (2) Among n=2000 morbidly obese bipolar disorder patients who meet criteria for bariatric surgery, determine if bariatric surgery affects psychiatric course (risk of psychiatric hospitalization, outpatient psychiatric utilization); and (3) Among n=5149 patients who underwent bariatric surgery (171 BD, 1999 major depression, 2979 neither affective disorder), determine if affective disorder is associated with weight loss and metabolic outcomes (diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia). We will employ longitudinal data representation from the counterfactual statistical framework. Multiple linear regression will be employed for linear outcomes (weight loss, number of outpatient visits), and multiple logistic regression will be employed for dichotomous outcomes. This study will be the first to present data on outcomes of bariatric surgery among bipolar disorder patients. Current, there are no BD-specific data on which to base clinic decision making in this population. As the excess mortality in BD is largely due to cardiovascular disease, this study will provide essential information to guide clinical decision making for morbidly obese BD patients and their physicians.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: People with bipolar disorder suffer higher risk of obesity and associated diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We propose to study how the most effective obesity therapy, bariatric surgery, affects psychiatric course, weight loss, and improvement in obesity-associated diseases (diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol) among bipolar disorder patients. Ours will be the first study of bariatric surgery outcomes in bipolar disorder, and will provided much-needed information to help bipolar disorder patients and their physicians make decisions about treatment options for morbid obesity.           People with bipolar disorder suffer higher risk of obesity and associated diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

"Human-Centered Perceptual and Conceptual Classification of Biomedical Images    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biomedical images are ever increasing in quantity and importance yet effective computing solutions for managing images and understanding their content are lacking. Image understanding is a key limiting factor in advancing these endeavors. Major challenges remain in understanding the capabilities of the human visual system with respect to biomedical imaging and in extracting and utilizing tacit knowledge of domain experts. To meet these challenges, we propose an innovative, multidisciplinary approach which combines methods of user centered design, visual perception and computer imaging research to interact with domain experts and to elicit and use their extrinsic and intrinsic knowledge. We will use a novel contextual design approach to inspection of dermatology images to discover relationships between perceptually- relevant visual content of images and users' conceptual understanding as expressed through natural language. Analysis of users' eye movements and verbal descriptions, together with mapping to domain medical ontologies, will allow us to integrate visual data with a user-specified language model to define perceptual categories and inform image classification. This is a fundamental and challenging data to knowledge problem that has not been solved. This study will provide proof of concept of the value of eliciting tacit knowledge from domain experts through multiple perceptually relevant modes in order to integrate data and knowledge models for better image understanding and may help enact a paradigm shift in how we conceptualize and develop biomedical information systems, in general.             Project Narrative Biomedical images are ever increasing in quantity yet their usefulness for research, medicine, and teaching is limited by the design of current computing systems. Discoveries and concrete advances made in this study will contribute to solutions for effective use of digital images-a problem that is central to research and application across science, technology, and medicine. Advancements in our understanding of the design of useful and usable information systems will benefit society at large and contribute to the public health.

"Machine Learning Tools for Prognostication in Melanoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the study is to develop and validate a tool for reliable individualized prognostication of Stage III melanoma patients for use in the clinical setting.  Cutaneous melanoma is the sixth most common cancer in the United States, and its incidence rate is increasing faster than any other cancer. Nearly 69,000 new cases are expected be diagnosed in this country in 2010. While thin melanomas are typically cured with excision alone, thicker melanomas have a greater tendency to metastasize to the regional lymph nodes.  A diagnosis of Stage III melanoma is made if there is spread to the regional lymph nodes. Unfortunately, there is marked diversity in the natural history of Stage III melanoma, and outcomes within this group are extremely heterogeneous, with 5- year survival rates ranging from 23% to 87%. Similarly, treatment options range from intensive forms of systemic therapy to observation. Understanding patients' differences in clinical outcome is critical not only for calibrating therapeutic intensity to metastatic risk but also in the design and analysis of clinical trials.  There is a real void of reliable prognostic tools for Stage III melanoma. Based on novel machine learning approaches, the purpose of this study will be to develop and validate a reliable and individualized tool for prognostication of Stage III melanoma patients that can be used in the clinical setting.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the study is to develop and validate a tool for reliable individualized prognostication of Stage III melanoma patients for use in the clinical setting.           The purpose of the study is to develop and validate a tool for reliable individualized prognostication of Stage III melanoma patients for use in the clinical setting.         ",Machine Learning Tools for Prognostication in Melanoma,8114413,R21CA152775,"['Address', 'American Joint Committee on Cancer', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Cutaneous Melanoma', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Heterogeneity', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Interferons', 'Logic', 'Lymph Node Dissections', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metastatic to', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Natural History', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nodal', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'editorial', 'flexibility', 'forest', 'hazard', 'lymph nodes', 'melanoma', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2011,193798,641965656,-0.019951206093484004
"Assessing Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules With Electrical Impedance Measurements    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thyroid nodules are present in a large fraction of healthy individuals. Between 4% and 7% of the United States adult population has palpable thyroid nodules, and up to 50% of American women older than age 50 have nodules that can be depicted on ultrasound. The vast majority (>95%) of thyroid nodules are benign. However, cancer risk increases with male gender, nodule size, extremes of age (< 30 and > 60 years), underlying autoimmune disease, nodule growth, personal or family history of thyroid cancer, and radiation exposure. Ultrasound imaging and Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAB) remain the mainstays of thyroid nodule evaluation. Unfortunately, 25% of patients who ultimately undergo FNAB of a thyroid nodule have indeterminate cytology. Many of these patients will require at least partial thyroidectomy purely for the purpose of obtaining a definitive diagnosis. Given that only 30% of these will ultimately prove to be malignant on surgical pathology, the majority of these lobectomies could potentially be avoided if better non-invasive methods existed to evaluate indeterminate nodules. Electrical Impedance Scanning (EIS) has been previously investigated for non-invasive evaluation of thyroid nodules. The overall diagnostic accuracy of EIS was encouraging but not sufficient for routine clinical use. We have developed a modified approach termed here Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) that should have substantially higher sensitivity and specificity for this very purpose. When using REIS technology to examine the breast, we obtained initial results that are significantly better in all respects than those obtained with traditional EIS. We believe that REIS technology will similarly improve the assessment of thyroid nodules. REIS hold promise as a reproducible modality for the risk stratification of the many patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules. It is a new non- invasive modality that may help reduce the number of diagnostic lobectomies and would be welcomed by patients with non-diagnostic FNA results. The purpose of this application is to design, assemble, and test in a preliminary clinical study a unique REIS based device for the assessment of thyroid nodules.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to design, assemble, and test in technical and preliminary human studies a non-invasive, easy to use device for measuring Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) of FNA indeterminate thyroid nodules.

"Digital image analysis for quantitative and qualitative assessment of pig islets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The demonstration by the Edmonton group that human islet transplantation can be successfully used to manage adult type 1 diabetes patients with refractory hypoglycemia has led to increased funding of clinical trials and further research to extend the scope of this therapy by using porcine islets in place of human islets. Significant advances have been made in improving immunosuppression treatment regimens so that results obtained from treating adult diabetic patients with human islet transplants are similar to those obtained after pancreas transplantation. The major hurdle to move this therapy from clinical research to routine clinical practice is to improve the yield and quality of islets recovered from human or porcine pancreas. Presently, there are no standardized methods that can accurately assess the number or quality of islets that are used in the islet transplantation procedures so that results between laboratories can be objectively evaluated. This grant is focused on developing a robust, islet image analysis software to objectively analyze the number and quality of porcine islets recovered from the pancreas. The two major aims of the project are first to develop an improved image analysis software program that will provide a standardized measurement of the number and mass of porcine islets in a cell preparation. And second, enhance the capabilities of the software program by correlating the image signatures of each porcine islet to an artificial category. Porcine islets of similar size will be handpicked and sorted into three categories based on the shape, border, integrity, or uniformity of dithizone staining. The first software enhancement will find those features in the images that can be used to distinguish the different categories of islets. The second enhancement will assess the feasibility of using machine learning methods to correlate these features with data recovered from the images but also other discrete or continuous variables that are used to characterize the porcine islet preparations. If successful, the ability to use a rapid and objective image analysis methodology will improve the assessment of the number and quality of islets within and between laboratories; correlate image features with success of transplantation as measured by graft survival and insulin independence; and improve the islet isolation methods to achieve favorable islet image scores that are determined by retrospective analysis. The ability of a commercial firm focused on improving islet yields by focusing on tissue dissociation with a leading academic laboratory that has sophisticated expertise in developing software algorithms from microscopic images provides a fresh approach to a difficult medical that needs to be resolved to realize the full potential of islet transplantation to treat adult type 1 diabetic patients.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An objective, reliable and accurate method for the assessment of islet quantity and quality is paramount to the standardization and subsequent success of islet transplantation as a treatment for type 1 diabetes. Conventional manual methods for determining islet yields using an optical microscope with a calibrated eyepiece reticule are subjective, time consuming and often overestimate islet mass due to sampling errors and erroneous assumptions in the conversion of islet numbers to islet equivalents. The research proposed will utilize recent advances in digital image analysis, including machine learning and pattern recognition, to develop a software algorithm for the rapid characterization of islets destined for transplantation procedures.           An objective, reliable and accurate method for the assessment of islet quantity and quality is paramount to the standardization and subsequent success of islet transplantation as a treatment for type 1 diabetes.

"Clinical Image Retrieval: User needs assessment toolbox development & evaluation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Advances in digital imaging technologies have led to a substantial growth in the number of digital images being created and stored in hospitals, medical systems, and on the Internet in recent years. Effective medical image retrieval systems can play an important role in teaching, research, diagnosis and treatment. Images were historically retrieved using text-based methods. The quality of annotations associated with images can reduce the effectiveness of text-based image retrieval. Despite recent advances, purely content- based image retrieval techniques lag significantly behind their textual counterparts in their ability to capture the semantic essence of the user's query. Preliminary research suggests that a more promising approach is to adaptively combine these complementary techniques to suit the user and their information needs. However, for these approaches to succeed, the researcher needs to enhance her computational skills in addition to acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the relevant clinical domain. This Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) grant application describes a training and career development plan that will allow the candidate, an NLM postdoctoral fellow in Medical Informatics at Oregon Health & Science University to achieve these objectives. The training component will be carried out under the mentorship of Dr. W. Hersh with Dr. Gorman (user studies). Dr. Fuss (radiation medicine) and Dr. Erdogmus (machine learning) providing additional mentoring in their areas of expertise.       The long-term goal of this Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) project is to improve visual information retrieval by better understanding user needs and proposing adaptive methodologies for multimodal image retrieval that will close the semantic gap. During the award period, activities will be focused on the following specific aims: (1) Understand the image retrieval needs of novice and expert users in radiation oncology and develop gold standards for evaluation; (2) Develop algorithms for semantic, multimodal image retrieval; (3) Perform user based evaluation of adaptive image retrieval in radiation oncology; (4) Extend the techniques developed to create a multimodal image retrieval system in pathology          n/a",Clinical Image Retrieval: User needs assessment toolbox development & evaluation,8299311,R00LM009889,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Applications Grants', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion', 'Distance Learning', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image retrieval system', 'Imaging technology', 'Information Retrieval', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric System', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Needs Assessment', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Oregon', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality Control', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer site', 'care delivery', 'career development', 'data mining', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'improved', 'information model', 'meetings', 'oncology', 'open source', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'visual information']",NLM,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R00,2011,239426,551214295,0.001905517512641188
"Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the introduction of Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine in 1796, vaccines have proven invaluable for their ability to stimulate the immune system and to confer protection against pathogenic organisms. Progress in modern vaccine research has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of vaccine-related papers in the published literature. It has become increasingly challenging to identify and annotate vaccine data from this large and diverse literature which no one scientist or team can fully master. Although vaccine databases exist that emphasize commercialized vaccines, no public central repository is available to store research data concerning commercial vaccines, vaccines in clinical trials, or vaccine candidates in early stages of development, in a fashion that render such data available for advanced analyses. To fill this need, we have developed VIOLIN (http://www.violinet.org), a web-based database system for annotation, storage, and analysis of published vaccine data. An ontology represents consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations, with associated definitions which are logically formulated in such a way as to promote automated reasoning. A bottleneck of vaccine research and further VIOLIN development is the lack of a vaccine ontology, which in turn makes a significant obstacle for vaccine data standardization, retrieval, integration, and advanced analysis and prediction. Our goal is to develop the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and apply it to efficient vaccine literature mining and analysis of protective immune mechanisms. We will focus on two model pathogens: Escherichia coli and Brucella species. This project contains three specific aims: (1) develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO), and apply it to establish a vaccine knowledgebase and to promote vaccine data integration and query through Semantic Web. The VO development will be achieved through collaboration with vaccine researchers, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Initiative, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO); (2) develop a VO-based natural language processing (NLP) system and apply it for more efficient retrieval of Brucella and E. coli vaccine information, automated annotation of journal articles with VO terms, and VO improvement. This task will be achieved by collaboration with the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). (3) analyze and predict vaccine targets and protective immune networks attributable to the interactions between host and vaccine. This will be achieved mainly by VO-based literature mining and a novel genome- and literature-based statistical methodology. This project will be implemented by a strong collaborative team and supported from a large user community. The Vaccine Ontology and its applications to literature mining and for studying protective immunity against Brucella spp. and E. coli will lay a strong foundation for further advanced informatics research on vaccines against infectious diseases in the post-genomics and information era.            Narrative: Vaccines stimulate the immune system and confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms. A bottleneck of vaccine research is the lack of an ontology (consensus- based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations) to ensure consistency of literature curation and support automated reasoning.

"Automated Web-Based Behavioral Diagnostics of Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade. A critical goal of Alzheimer's disease research is to improve current methods of diagnosis so that patients can be identified sooner and, therefore, obtain greater advantage from available therapies. The major goal of this project is to develop and validate an automated, web-based method for early diagnosis of cognitive decline and memory loss. We will build on current research that has demonstrated a clear link between performance on the Visual Paired- Comparison Task (VPC) and diagnosis of MCI, and we will extend the impact of this finding by developing a suite of software tools and analysis methods that will improve the accuracy and extend the accessibility of cognitive diagnostics with a web-based VPC task that can be widely deployed. Although the VPC task is promising as a diagnostic aid, clinical application is severely limited by the need to use an eye tracker to precisely monitor subjects' eye movements. Unfortunately, eye trackers are expensive, require trained personnel, and are not widely available. However, our preliminary findings show that it is possible to produce picture examination behavior that is similar to eye-movements, using modified versions of the VPC task that could be administered by anyone, on any computer with an internet connection. In addition, powerful machine learning techniques from computer science can help accurately analyze and diagnose the resulting behavior. An important contribution from this work will be the possibility of predicting oncoming cognitive decline in MCI patients sooner than is now possible, that is, at a time when the nervous system is less compromised and more likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. In support of this objective, we propose three aims: 1) Develop and investigate appropriate representation of eye movement characteristics and corresponding machine learning-based classification techniques for effective identification of the patient status, 2) Develop and validate a web-based version of the VPC task, and 3) explore the feasibility of our task as an automatic screening instrument for the general elderly population. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to dramatically alter the current practice of clinical translational research as well as the current methods used for diagnosing cognitive deficits. This would enable thousands and potentially millions of patients and potential research subjects to take the test as part of their routine checkup, requiring nothing more than a computer with an internet connection.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade.

"Hand Sensorimotor Function and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The median nerve is susceptible to compression in the wrist, leading to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is the most common compression neuropathy and have an immense impact on national health care, worker productivity, and quality of life. Despite its high prevalence and public health cost, our understanding of CTS is limited, and the management of CTS awaits improvement. The central notion of this project is that hand sensorimotor function is sensitive to peripheral median neuropathy and that the central nervous system is affected by CTS, causing the associated sensorimotor deficit. We will investigate this notion with quantifiable sensorimotor data from novel biomechanical and neurophysiological studies. This project has three aims consisting of biomechanical, neurophysiological and translational research. The first aim is to investigate CTS-induced pathokinematic and pathokinetic performance using dexterous manual tasks of thumb opposition, reach-to-pinch, precision grip, and finger pressing. The second aim is to investigate the neurophysiological implications of chronic peripheral neuropathy (i.e., CTS) on the central nervous system by evaluating corticomuscular coupling and stretch reflex. The third aim is to identify novel biomechanical and neurophysiological markers for CTS cases using machine learning and classification algorithms. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of CTS and aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder. More generally, CTS as a chronic neuropathy serves as an effective model to study sensorimotor mechanisms of the peripheral and central nervous systems. In addition, the methodology developed in this project is applicable to other neuromuscular disorders.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly. One of the distinct consequences of carpal tunnel syndrome is that patients experience inexplicable dropping of objects and clumsiness while performing simple daily tasks. In this project, we propose to study the sensorimotor deficit using novel biomechanical and neurophysiological experiments. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and manifestations of carpal tunnel syndrome. This project is clinically translational to aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder.                   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly.

"Real-Time MRI Motion Correction System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MOTIVATION - Motion remains one of the most frequent contributors to image artifacts in MR studies.  The motion susceptibility of MRI is well-known and has spawned a number of elegant navigation techniques.  These methods, however, are tailored to specific MR acquisitions that require modified k-space trajectories or the acquisition of additional MR data, and most are unable to correct certain types of motion, for example, through-plane motion.  Moreover, motion correction has been focused on specific families of sequences, but no generally applicable approach currently exists.  Certain patient populations, such as pediatric or geriatric patients, are more likely to move than others.  In pediatric imaging, anesthesia is used to control motion, adding substantially to exam costs and patient risks.  A sequence-independent, autonomous and prospective motion correction system could greatly improve image quality for a wide spectrum of MR examinations.  For pediatric imaging, in particular, we anticipate reduced reliance on anesthesia to control patient motion.  AIMS - We will be focusing on three independent specific aims (carried out in parallel and completed within 4 years), with corresponding subaims that we believe are important for establishing the technical/scientific merit and to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed R&D efforts for our real-time adaptive motion correction approach.  Specifically, these aims are:  (1) to develop and evaluate a coil-mounted MR-compatible tracking device for routine clinical use; (2) to integrate pose tracking into real-time MRI; and (3) to validate our real-time motion correction system in volunteers and patients.  METHODS -In Aim 1 we will improve the methods for computer-vision-based pose estimation inside an MR scanner and build an MR-compatible coil-mounted pose tracker that can be used in clinical routine examinations.  In Aim 2 we will focus on reducing the latency between pose changes happening and the MR scanner reacting to these pose changes, and on building a software library for the MR pulse sequence development that allows one to implement real-time motion correction into all MR pulse sequences.  In Aim 3 we will perform a thorough evaluation of our system on 60 volunteers (30 adults and 30 children) and 120 patients (80 adults and 40 children).  SIGNIFICANCE - The impact of our technology has several facets.  First, it will improve patient care by reducing the number of MR images with compromised quality because of motion artifacts.  Especially because of the increasing reliance on MR Images as a primary means of diagnosis, this will reduce the number of misdiagnoses.  Secondly, this technology will help to lower the high national spending on imaging by dramatically improving the efficiency of MRI scanners.  Finally, it will improve patient comfort by reducing the need for repeat sequences, as well as reduce the necessity of sedation aimed at keeping the patient still.  Overall, this technology will have a significant impact on MRI both in clinical practice and basic science research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Synopsis Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.  This is not only of increasing concern due to the aging population and its associated diseases, but also in children and patients who are simply too sick to remain still during an exam.  This proposal aims to build an optical tracking system and methods to adapt MRI pulse sequences to changes in patient pose in real time.  The project leverages on previous work from an R21 project in which a prototype system was successfully built.  Specifically, the aims are to (i) introduce innovative improvements to the existing prototype, making the system suitable for use in clinical routine, (ii) modify the optical tracking system to be compatible with multiple MR sequences, and (iii) perform clinical evaluation.  Our real-time technique is a unique and innovative solution that will improve MRI image quality and thus patient care, and will address the escalating burden of imaging costs on the health care system.              Synopsis  Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.

"Improving Prematurity-related Respiratory Outcomes at Vanderbilt (IMPROV)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease that impacts the pulmonary and overall health of more than 10,000 infants in the US each year. The long-term objective of this Clinical Research Center (CRC) is translation of biochemical, genetic and bioinformatics research into innovative interventions that improve outcomes of extremely preterm infants at risk for long- term pulmonary morbidity. Our proposal focuses specifically on the urea cycle-nitric oxide (UC-NO) and glutathione (GSH) pathways as pivotal and interrelated mechanisms in the response of the developing lung to the extrauterine environment. Overall hypotheses: (1) Biochemical immaturity and functional genetic variation in the UC-NO and GSH pathways modulate the BPD phenotype spectrum; (2) The duration and degree of NO insufficiency and free radical excess predicts BPD severity and correlates with pulmonary morbidity after NICU discharge. To investigate our hypothesis, our CRC will enroll 250 infants with birthweights 510-1250 grams and follow the survivors through 1 year of life. Our hypothesis invokes an immature hepatic and gut synthetic capacity to make citrulline and GSH, functional genetic variations in the UC-NO and GSH pathways, nutritional deficiencies and the physiologic and environmental stress of preterm birth. The resultant NO deficiency and free radical excess alters pulmonary vascular and alveolar development. Our biomarker discovery concept includes (a) collection of plasma, urine, red blood cells, DNA and tracheal aspirates for measurements of NO and GSH precursor sufficiency, production of NO metabolites and GSH, functional genetic variants in these pathways, and biomarkers of in vivo oxidative stress and (b) validation of these biomarkers for diagnosis and long term prognosis of patients with BPD. A bioinformatics approach using machine learning and predictive modeling has been developed for respiratory phenotyping and risk stratification at 36 weeks and 40 weeks postmenstrual age and at 12 months after hospital discharge.

"Toward Individually-tailored Medicine: Probabilistic Models of Cerebral Aneurysms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding, both from incidental discovery on imaging studies and on autopsy; it is estimated that anywhere from 1-6% of the American population will develop this problem. Unfortunately, while our ability to detect ICAs has grown, our fundamental understanding of this disease entity remains lacking and significant debate continues in regards to its treatment. Given the high degree of mortality and comorbidity associated with ruptured intracranial aneurysms, it is imperative that new insights and approaches be developed to inform medical decision making involving ICAs. Thus, the objective of this proposal is the creation of an informatics infrastructure to help elucidate the genesis, progression, and treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Building from our efforts from the previous R01, a set of technical developments is outlined to transform the array of information routinely collected from clinical as- sessment of ICA patients into a Bayesian belief network (BBN) that models the disease. First, we evolve the concept of a phenomenon-centric data model (PCDM) as the basis for (temporally) organizing clinically-derived observations, enabling the model to be associated with processing pipelines that can identify and transform targeted variables from the content of clinical data sources. Through these pipelines, specific values in free- text reports (radiology, surgery, pathology, discharge summaries) and imaging studies will be automatically extracted into a scientific-quality database. Second, the PCDM schema for ICAs is mapped to a Bayesian belief network: the linkage between the PCDM and BBN allows automatic updating of the network and its progressive refinement from a growing dataset. The BBN's topology will be determined by clinical experts and conditional probabilities computed from the extracted clinical data. A basic graphical user interface (GUI) will permit users to interact with the BBN, aiding in medical decision making tasks. The GUI will allow a clinician to pose questions from either a set of common clinical queries or to create new queries: loading a patient's medical record into this application will automatically populate BBN variables with extracted information (i.e., from the pipelines). Each technical component of this proposal will be evaluated in a laboratory setting. In addition, the BBN will be tested for its predictive capabilities and compared to other statistical models to assess its potential in guiding ICA treatment. This proposal leverages a clinical collaboration with the UCLA Division of Interventional Neuroradiology, a leader in ICA research and treatment. A combined dataset of 2,000 retrospective and prospective subjects will be used to create the ICA database and BBN. Data collection will encompass a comprehensive set of variables including clinical presentation, imaging assessment (morphology, hemodynamics), histopathology, gene expression, treatment, and outcomes. We will additionally leverage the NIH/NINDS Human Genetic DNA and Cell Line Repository for additional ICA-related data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding on routine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) neuro-imaging studies. The associated mortality rate and comorbidity resultant from ruptured ICAs are extreme: subarachnoid hemorrhage causes 50% of individuals to die within one month of rupture, and more than one third of survivors develop major neurological deficits. Hence, the focus of this re- search is the creation of a comprehensive research database for ICA patients, using the spectrum of data routinely acquired in the diagnosis and treatment of the problem; from this database, a new probabilistic model of ICAs will be created, providing new insights into the disease and its optimal treatment for a given individual.           PROGRAM NARRATIVE Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding on routine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) neuro-imaging studies.

"Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California Population-based biobanks are a critical resource for identifying disease mechanisms and developing screening tests for biomarkers associated with certain disorders. The California Department of Public Health has been banking newborn specimens statewide since 1982 (N~14 million) and maternal prenatal specimens for a portion of the state since 2000 (N~1 million), creating one of the largest, if not the largest single biological specimen banks with linked data in the world. With the fast pace of new knowledge in genetics and laboratory methods, the demand for specimens and data from researchers around the world now far surpasses the Department's ability to fill them. The goal of this infrastructure development project is to create an efficient, high throughput, low cost newborn screening and prenatal/maternal screening specimen biobank and linked data base that could be used by large numbers of researchers around the world for a wide range of studies through the following aims: (1) establishment of highly efficient protocols and procurement and integration of automated systems for pulling and processing specimens; (2) development of an integrated specimen tracking system into the Department's existing web-based Screening Information System; (3) development of a computerized system to track application requests for specimens and data; and (4) development of a linked screening program-vital records database that is organized into a life course, client based system. These aims will be accomplished through expansion of the Department's award-winning Screening Integration System to include web-based tracking of specimens and research requests, and use of an innovative machine-learning record matching application for high-performance linkages. After the 2 year grant period is completed, the California Research Ready Biospecimen Bank will be able to provide researchers with valuable biological specimens in a timely, cost-effective manner, thereby enabling a dramatic expansion of epidemiological research nationwide. The continuity of the system will be ensured by codifying human subjects-sensitive policies and procedures into Departmental regulations and by charging researchers modest fees for specimens, data and other research services.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of a research-ready pregnancy and newborn biobank in California This proposal funds infrastructure development to create a research-ready, efficient, high- throughput, and low-cost prenatal and newborn biobank in California.

"Access to Liver Transplantation for Patients with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic liver disease that has no treatment and is an otherwise fatal disease without liver transplantation. Patients with PSC face unique complications as compared to other patients with end-stage liver disease, including cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), cholangitis from biliary strictures, and complications such as colon cancer from concomitant inflammatory bowel disease. The current model for allocation of livers, instituted on February 27th, 2002, relies on a patient's Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, which accounts for a patient's serum INR, creatinine, and bilirubin. The MELD score places more weight on the INR and creatinine, although in patients with PSC the bilirubin is disproportionately elevated. This fact, along with the fact that complications such as CCA are not captured by the MELD data elements, leads us to believe that the MELD score may place patients with PSC at a survival disadvantage. If this is true, then this may serve as a basis for a policy change in how livers are allocated. For patients with PSC on the waitlist, their risk of death may be higher for two reasons. Either the risk of death for a given MELD score is higher for patients with PSC, or in patients with PSC, the MELD score rises more slowly, making patients less likely to receive a transplant and thereby exposed for a longer duration to the risks of clinical deterioration and removal from the waitlist. Our first aim will address this primary research question in three ways. We will develop two Cox proportional hazard models, one accounting for all of a patient's MELD scores while on the waitlist, and another adjusting only for MELD at listing. We will also perform logistic regression to evaluate the clinically important outcome of death vs. transplant. Our second aim will serve to determine the frequencies with which potential liver transplant recipients are removed from the waitlist due to clinical deterioration among those in whom the reasons for withdrawal are unspecified in UNOS data. By collecting patient level data from individual transplant centers, we will be able to calculate the extent of this outcome misclassification and thereby guide quantitative sensitivity analyses of our primary models in Aim I. Lastly, we will evaluate whether introduction of the MELD system for liver allocation was associated with changes in rates of living donor liver transplantation among patients with PSC relative to corresponding rates among patients without PSC. This analysis is needed as differential rates of referral for living donor transplant among patients with and without PSC could affect the extent to which diagnosis may influence the outcomes in Aim I. The proposed research project will be in the context of the applicant working towards a Masters of Science in Clinical Epidemiology, whereby didactic learning in the classroom, focusing on fundamentals of epidemiology, study design, and statistical and analytic methods of research will enhance and guide the research process of the applicant. The long-term objectives of the applicant for this project are to collect and analyze the data, prepare manuscripts for publication, and build upon the data as part of a future application for a K award.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The allocation of organs for liver transplantation has major public health implications in that decisions must be made as to how we allocate a scarce resource. It is critical that we practice within a system that is equitable, and does not disadvantage one group of patients as a result of their disease status. If it is found that patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis are disadvantaged by the current liver allocation system, then this will form a foundation for which large-scale policy changes are considered to bring about a fairer system of organ transplantation.           Project Narrative/Relevance The allocation of organs for liver transplantation has major public health implications in that decisions must be made as to how we allocate a scarce resource.

"Integrating Quantitative Histological Image and Vascular Density Patterns for Pro    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       With increasing detection of early CaP with improved diagnostic methodologies, it has become important to predict biologic behaviors and ""aggressivity"" to identify patients who might benefit from a ""wait and watch policy"" as opposed to those who need more aggressive strategies. Traditionally, T-stage, amount of cancer in the core biopsy, the Gleason grade, and PSA at diagnosis has been used to evaluate the prognosis in localized CaP. While the Gleason score is currently assumed to be the strongest prognostic marker for CaP, there is often considerably high inter-, intra-observer variability associated with Gleason grade determination by pathologists. While some newer markers have recently shown promise, none of these methods have individually proven to be accurate enough to serve routinely as a prognostic marker for CaP.  Recently, there has been a call to combine multiple prognostic markers to create an integrated meta-marker, with potentially greater accuracy in predicting CaP recurrence compared to any individual marker. While it is apparent that prognostic information resides in histopathology imagery in terms of the arrangement of nuclei and glands, sophisticated graph, and computerized image analysis algorithms are required to quantitatively model and characterize the architectural appearance of prostate cancer histopathology and thus provide a marker that is accurate and reproducible (unlike Gleason grade). In addition, while tumor micro-vascular density has been correlated to CaP outcome, prognostic information may also potentially reside in the specific spatial architectural arrangement of the micro-vascular network. The objective of the proposed work is to develop an integrated quantitative prognostic marker that combines information based on architectural arrangement of nuclear, glandular, and micro-vasculature network patterns on whole mount histology sections (WMHS) obtained via radical prostatectomy (RP) to predict prostate cancer recurrence.  The proposed work comprises a total of 3 specific aims. For this project we will digitize approximately 100 annonymized WMHS obtained via RP that have been matched for Gleason score, stage, PSA, but with different clinical outcomes (half the patients having undergone cancer recurrence and the other not, following RP). Under Aim 1, segmentation algorithms will be developed to automatically identify cancerous nuclei, glands and tumor microvasculature (MV), stained immuno-histochemically via CD31. Under Aim 2 we will apply graph based image analysis algorithms to quantitatively characterize the architectural arrangement of CaP nuclei, glands and the MV network. These graph-based features will be integrated via a computerized machine learning algorithm to yield a numerical image based risk score (IbRiS) reflecting the CaP prognosis (disease recurrence or non-recurrence) of the patient. IbRiS will be evaluated in terms of its ability to distinguish between CaP progressors and non-progressors (matched for stage, Gleason grade, PSA), in a cohort of 50 independent studies (test set) for which survival and outcome data is available.  This project will be a collaboration between investigators at Rutgers University (RU) and the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN). Data accrual will be done at UPENN while algorithmic development for computerized image analysis and classification will be carried out at RU.             The broad long term goal of this project is to develop an integrated image based histological biomarker for  predicting  prostate  cancer  (CaP)  survival  and  outcome  by  integrating  quantitative  image  signatures  that  define  tissue  architecture  and  vascular  density  patterns.  Sophisticated  image  analysis  and  graph  based  algorithms will be developed to yield an image based risk score (IbRis) to predict whether or not a CaP patient  will  have  disease  recurrence  following  treatment.  Our  hypothesis  is  that  IbRis  will  prove  to  be  a  better  prognostic marker compared to such traditional markers as Gleason score and PSA.

"Clinical Image Retrieval: User needs assessment, toolbox development & evaluation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Advances in digital imaging technologies have led to a substantial growth in the number of digital images being created and stored in hospitals, medical systems, and on the Internet in recent years. Effective medical image retrieval systems can play an important role in teaching, research, diagnosis and treatment. Images were historically retrieved using text-based methods. The quality of annotations associated with images can reduce the effectiveness of text-based image retrieval. Despite recent advances, purely content- based image retrieval techniques lag significantly behind their textual counterparts in their ability to capture the semantic essence of the user's query. Preliminary research suggests that a more promising approach is to adaptively combine these complementary techniques to suit the user and their information needs. However, for these approaches to succeed, the researcher needs to enhance her computational skills in addition to acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the relevant clinical domain. This Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) grant application describes a training and career development plan that will allow the candidate, an NLM postdoctoral fellow in Medical Informatics at Oregon Health & Science University to achieve these objectives. The training component will be carried out under the mentorship of Dr. W. Hersh with Dr. Gorman (user studies). Dr. Fuss (radiation medicine) and Dr. Erdogmus (machine learning) providing additional mentoring in their areas of expertise.       The long-term goal of this Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) project is to improve visual information retrieval by better understanding user needs and proposing adaptive methodologies for multimodal image retrieval that will close the semantic gap.

"Early Acute Lung Injury: Prospective Evaluation Prior to Respiratory Failure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Acute lung injury (ALI) is a syndrome of acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to pulmonary and non-pulmonary insults and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite two decades of targeted investigation by the NHLBI, little is known about ALI prior to progression to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Accordingly, the aims of this research plan are to: 1) prospectively identify independent predictors of progression to ALI requiring mechanical ventilation and establish a clinical definition of early ALI; 2) evaluate the pathogenetic role of biologic markers of inflammation and lung injury and their value for refining risk stratification of patients at risk for progression to ALI, and 3) test the potential therapeutic value of an aerosolized beta-2 agonist in patients with early ALI. In SPECIFIC AIM 1 will identify cases of potential early ALI by screening chest radiographs of all adult emergency department and medicine service admissions. Patients admitted to the hospital with bilateral opacities on chest radiograph not due to isolated left atrial hypertension will be followed for progression to ALI during their hospitalization. Clinical characteristics (demographics, diagnoses, comorbidities, vital signs, and Borg dyspnea scores) will be recorded for the first 72 hours of admission. Independent predictors of progression to ALI will be determined by multivariate logistic regression and incorporated into a clinical definition of early ALI. In SPECIFIC AIM 2, plasma levels of biomarkers (IL-8, sTNFr-1, vWF, ICAM-1, SP-D and RAGE) representing distinct pathways contributing to acute lung injury will be measured at time 0 and 24 hours after study enrollment. Biomarkers will be analyzed by multivariate regression analysis to assess their value for stratifying patients at risk for progression to ALI and provide mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of early ALI. In SPECIFIC AIM 3 I will conduct a randomized clinical trial of aerosoUzed albuterol vs. placebo in patients with early ALI. The primary endpoint will be the Pa02 / Fi02 on day 4 of treatment. Secondary outcome measures will be rate of progression to ALI and change in plasma biologic marker levels. This will be a first-of-its-kind trial to establish that patients with early ALI can be identified and treatment can be initiated prior to need for mechanical ventilation. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Following the paradigm of early goal-directed therapy for severe sepsis, clinical benefit may derive from identifying patients with early ALI and initiating treatment prior to the need for mechanical ventilation (and therefore prior to meeting current study entry criteria). Establishing evidence based clinical definition of early ALI will facilitate identification and risk stratification of subjects for enrollment in future clinical trials.

"Human-Centered Perceptual and Conceptual Classification of Biomedical Images    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biomedical images are ever increasing in quantity and importance yet effective computing solutions for managing images and understanding their content are lacking. Image understanding is a key limiting factor in advancing these endeavors. Major challenges remain in understanding the capabilities of the human visual system with respect to biomedical imaging and in extracting and utilizing tacit knowledge of domain experts. To meet these challenges, we propose an innovative, multidisciplinary approach which combines methods of user centered design, visual perception and computer imaging research to interact with domain experts and to elicit and use their extrinsic and intrinsic knowledge. We will use a novel contextual design approach to inspection of dermatology images to discover relationships between perceptually- relevant visual content of images and users' conceptual understanding as expressed through natural language. Analysis of users' eye movements and verbal descriptions, together with mapping to domain medical ontologies, will allow us to integrate visual data with a user-specified language model to define perceptual categories and inform image classification. This is a fundamental and challenging data to knowledge problem that has not been solved. This study will provide proof of concept of the value of eliciting tacit knowledge from domain experts through multiple perceptually relevant modes in order to integrate data and knowledge models for better image understanding and may help enact a paradigm shift in how we conceptualize and develop biomedical information systems, in general.             Project Narrative Biomedical images are ever increasing in quantity yet their usefulness for research, medicine, and teaching is limited by the design of current computing systems. Discoveries and concrete advances made in this study will contribute to solutions for effective use of digital images-a problem that is central to research and application across science, technology, and medicine. Advancements in our understanding of the design of useful and usable information systems will benefit society at large and contribute to the public health.

"Dx Ear: An automated tool for diagnosis of otitis media    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Otitis media is a general term for middle-ear inflammation that is classified clinically as either acute otitis media (AOM) or otitis media with effusion (OME). AOM represents a bacterial super infection of the middle ear fluid and OME a sterile effusion that tends to subside spontaneously. Antibiotics are generally beneficial only for AOM. Accurate diagnosis of AOM, as well as distinction from both OME and no effusion (NOE) requires considerable training.  AOM is the most common infection for which antimicrobial agents are prescribed for children in the US. By age seven, 93 percent of children will have experienced one or more episodes of otitis media.1 AOM results in significant social burden and indirect costs due to time lost from school and work. Estimated direct costs of AOM in 1995 were $1.96 billion and indirect costs were estimated to be $1.02 billion, with a total of 20 million prescriptions for antimicrobials related to otitis media.2 Given these considerations, our goal is to:  Develop a software tool to classify images into one of three stringent clinical diagnostic categories (AOM/OME/NOE), and validate the algorithm on tympanic membrane (TM) images.  We have assembled a strong multidisciplinary team that can successfully develop an automated diagnostic algorithm in this Phase-I program. We have (1) gathered a team of nationally-recognized otoscopists with substantial clinical and research experience in the context of AOM clinical trials; (2) studied the predictive value of diagnostic findings in discriminating AOM from OME from NOE; (3) acquired a large number of TM images from children; and (4) involved an internationally recognized expert in developing algorithms in all areas of image analysis and processing.  In the planned Phase-II, we will use the algorithm developed in the Phase-I program and incorporate it into a user-friendly and marketable digital otoscope-software platform that can be used at the point-of-care by clinicians to improve the care of children with this frequently occurring condition. This will be followed by a clinical trial evaluating its immediate impact on clinical care, and, in particular, utilization of antimicrobials.  Our main goal will be to develop an accurate automated algorithm for classifying the three diagnostic categories (AOM/OME/NOE). We aim to achieve an overall accuracy of 95 percent by applying a newly developed classification algorithm. This will include applying state-of-the-art classification methods as well as segmentation algorithms, for automated, robust diagnosis and classification of the three diagnostic categories (AOM/OME/NOE). We propose to achieve this through the following two specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Develop a robust and accurate diagnostic algorithm that can discriminate TM digital images into 1of 3 stringent diagnostic categories (AOM/OME/NOE).  Specific Aim 2: Validate the algorithm on a dataset that includes over 2000 TM images collected in a recently completed NIAID-sponsored clinical trial.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    AOM is the most common infection for which antimicrobial agents are prescribed in children in the US.

"Prevalence of FMRI Expansions in Movement Disorders Dr. Deborah Ann Hall is applying for a mentored patient-oriented research (K23) award in the area of movement disorders. This proposal describes a research and training program for the development of a clinician-investigator in neurology. The principal investigator, Dr. Hall, has completed neurology residency  raining and a movement disorders fellowship. She received a competitive clinical research fellowship from the American Academy of Neurology and is pursuing a Ph.D. in Clinical Science. The candidate's immediate goals are to continue research in the fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, by directly applying her newly acquired epidemiologic and biostatistics skills in the proposed project. Her long term goals are to study the genetic risk factors, neuroepidemiology, and treatment of ataxia, including sporadic ataxia. During the award period, Dr. Hall will be based in the Department of Neurology at the University of Colorado (UCDHSC). UCDHSC has an extensive track record for supporting and developing clinician-investigators. The Ph.D. in Clinical Sciences program at UCDHSC facilitates mentored multidisciplinary clinical research. The candidate will carry out her research with Professors Tim Byers MD (Epidemiology), Maureen Leehey MD (Neurology), Gary Zerbe PhD (Biostatistics), and Paul Hagerman MD PhD (Biological Chemistry). Dr. Hall's research program is to determine the prevalence of repeat expansions in the FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation) gene in subjects with tremor, ataxia, and/or parkinsonism. Dr. Hall will do a cross- sectional study by recruiting subjects in her clinics with the three phenotypes and performing PCR of the FMR1 gene. All subjects eligible will be recruited and the genetic testing will be done in a research laboratory. The primary outcomes to be measured are the prevalence of repeat expansions in the three groups combined and each phenotypic subgroup. The age of onset, age of diagnosis of neurological signs, and correlations between trinucleotide repeat size and phenotype are also outcomes to be measured. Linear and logistic regression models will be used and covariates including race and ethnicity will be studied. Relevance: This study is important because it may define genetic risk factors for various abnormal movements, such as tremor. This will result in improved diagnosis and potentially treatment of individuals with progressive neurological diseases. These illnesses represent an important public health problem as they cause morbidity and mortality in our aging population. n/a",Prevalence of FMRI Expansions in Movement Disorders,7804478,K23NS052487,"['Academy', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Area', 'Ataxia', 'Award', 'Biochemistry', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Colorado', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'FMR1', 'FMR1 Gene', 'FMR1 Premutation', 'FMR1 repeat expansion', 'FXTAS', 'Fellowship', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Gait abnormality', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intention Tremor', 'Laboratory Research', 'Length', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurology', 'Outcome', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Rain', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Residencies', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Training Programs', 'Tremor', 'Trinucleotide Repeats', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging population', 'base', 'disability', 'genetic risk factor', 'improved', 'male', 'meetings', 'men', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'primary outcome', 'professor', 'programs', 'skills']",NINDS,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2010,173340,55098220,-0.009864608324836308
"A New Paradigm for Integrated Analysis of Multiscale Genomic Imaging Datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A decade ago when microarray was first invented, it was hailed as ""an array of hope"" in Nature Genetics and has received a considerable amount of attention in biomedicine. Subsequently it has been called ""an array of problems"" in Nature Review. An inherent problem with microarray gene expression is that structural information is missing, which limits its ability in biological discovery. To overcome the poor reproducibility and accuracy of microarray imaging, there needs to be a shift in fundamental paradigms to those able to incorporate complementary and multiscale structural imaging information into microarray imaging. Fortunately, the latest progress in high resolution biomolecular imaging probe development coupled with advanced image analysis makes integrative and systematic studies of cellular systems possible. A cell can be labeled using multiscale and multimodality imaging, providing both structural and functional information. With multiscale imaging spreadsheets now available, there is an overwhelming need within the life sciences community to manage this information effectively, to analyze it comprehensively, and to apply the resulting knowledge in the understanding of the genetic system of a cell. However, the management and mining of this large-scale imaging information is limited by today's computational approaches and knowledge-sharing infrastructure. These problems represent a major impediment to progress in the emerging area of bio-molecular image informatics. Therefore, the goal of this project is to develop a unique genomic image management and mining system that can allow geneticists to search, correlate and integrate this multiscale and multi-modality imaging information in an easily operable fashion and further enable new biological discovery. In particular, this system will fill a void left in the current image database systems such as Open Microscope Environment (OME), e.g., the lack of analytic tools for integrative data analysis. To realize this goal, we are bringing together a strong interdisciplinary team consisting of imaging engineers, geneticists and industrial imaging scientists. Building on our diverse and complementary expertise, we are able to provide innovative and interdisciplinary approaches that combine the latest progress in image processing, imaging database design and machine learning with the development of high resolution and high throughput molecular imaging probes in genomics. More specifically, we will accomplish the following specific aims. First, we will develop a suite of algorithms for content extraction and information retrieval from high resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) images. This visual system will effectively manage imaging phenotype information, facilitating knowledge discovery such as identifying visually similar subtypes. Second, we will correlate quantitative traits extracted from FISH imaging with genomic structural rearrangements and gene expression patterns. Finally, we will develop a data integration approach to fuse disparate information from multi-modality imaging databases for improved characterization of biological systems.               Public Health Relevance Statement The anticipated outcome of the project will include a publicly accessible imaging database analysis system to facilitate multiscale genomic image information integration and knowledge mining. The proposed approach challenges the current paradigm by the integration of high resolution structural imaging with functional information, which promises to overcome the poor accuracy and reproducibility problems plagued with microarray imaging. Given the ubiquitous use of microarray imaging in biomedicine, the project is thus expected to be of great impact on the biomedical community.",A New Paradigm for Integrated Analysis of Multiscale Genomic Imaging Datasets,7845601,R21LM010042,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Blast Cell', 'Cells', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Comb animal structure', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Coupled', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'Hybridization Array', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Karyotype', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Microscope', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Prevention', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biological systems', 'complex biological systems', 'data integration', 'database design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder prevention', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'image processing', 'imaging informatics', 'imaging modality', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'knowledge of results', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'mutant', 'public health relevance', 'structural genomics', 'tool', 'trait', 'visual map']",NLM,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R21,2010,186306,92601146,-0.007770145451850701
"Improving Prematurity-related Respiratory Outcomes at Vanderbilt (IMPROV)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease that impacts the pulmonary and overall health of more than 10,000 infants in the US each year. The long-term objective of this Clinical Research Center (CRC) is translation of biochemical, genetic and bioinformatics research into innovative interventions that improve outcomes of extremely preterm infants at risk for long- term pulmonary morbidity. Our proposal focuses specifically on the urea cycle-nitric oxide (UC-NO) and glutathione (GSH) pathways as pivotal and interrelated mechanisms in the response of the developing lung to the extrauterine environment. Overall hypotheses: (1) Biochemical immaturity and functional genetic variation in the UC-NO and GSH pathways modulate the BPD phenotype spectrum; (2) The duration and degree of NO insufficiency and free radical excess predicts BPD severity and correlates with pulmonary morbidity after NICU discharge. To investigate our hypothesis, our CRC will enroll 250 infants with birthweights 510-1250 grams and follow the survivors through 1 year of life. Our hypothesis invokes an immature hepatic and gut synthetic capacity to make citrulline and GSH, functional genetic variations in the UC-NO and GSH pathways, nutritional deficiencies and the physiologic and environmental stress of preterm birth. The resultant NO deficiency and free radical excess alters pulmonary vascular and alveolar development. Our biomarker discovery concept includes (a) collection of plasma, urine, red blood cells, DNA and tracheal aspirates for measurements of NO and GSH precursor sufficiency, production of NO metabolites and GSH, functional genetic variants in these pathways, and biomarkers of in vivo oxidative stress and (b) validation of these biomarkers for diagnosis and long term prognosis of patients with BPD. A bioinformatics approach using machine learning and predictive modeling has been developed for respiratory phenotyping and risk stratification at 36 weeks and 40 weeks postmenstrual age and at 12 months after hospital discharge. Accomplishment of these goals will promote novel clinical trials design to test new therapies to prevent BPD and improve long term pulmonary health of infants born preterm. (End of Abstract)      RELEVANCE: Each year in the US, more than 10,000 premature infants develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease associated with prolonged and recurrent hospitalizations and lifelong alterations in lung function.

"Machine-Learning Approach to Label-free Detection of new Bacterial Pathogens    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We appreciate the time and effort spent by all the reviewers, and we are grateful for the useful comments and provided suggestions. We have carefully reviewed the critiques and we are happy to see that the panel was receptive to our proposal. The reviewers expressed three major concerns in the summary statement: (1) although the investigating team is well qualified our history of collaboration is short; (2) details regarding the practical constraints of the BARDOT system are lacking; (3) the machine learning techniques employed in the project are considered fairly standard.  Below we briefly discuss the reviewers comments and indicate how we have changed our revised application to address the critique.  (1) Dr. Dundar moved from industry to academia in the fall of 2008, at which point Dr. Rajwa (one of the original inventors of BARDOT) and Dr. Dundar began their collaboration on new approaches to the problem of non-exhaustively defined classes in phenotypic screening. This scientific partnership immediately produced interesting results, and at the time of submission of the original application, Dr. Dundar and Dr. Rajwa had their first manuscript under review. The approach presented in the original proposal was tested and the results were submitted to the ACM 15th Annual SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD'09), which is the largest and one of the most respected conferences in this field. The manuscript was accepted after a full peer review as one of the 50 regular papers selected from 551 submissions [20]. Following the proposal submission, research efforts continued and produced yet another approach to the problem described in this grant application. The preliminary findings are reported in a new manuscript which is currently under review [4].  (2) We rewrote the background and research methods sections of our proposal to include information re- quested by the reviewers regarding practical aspects of the BARDOT system, such as accuracy issues (Section D.3.2), frequency of encountering new, unknown classes (Section B.3.1), and validation (Section D.3.1).  (3) The problem of phenotypic screening and classification of bacteria can be defined within exhaustive (stan- dard) or non-exhaustive learning frameworks. Although we agree that the implementation of an exhaustive clas- sification approach for BARDOT does require only fairly standard tools, the problem of the non-exhaustive nature of training libraries cannot be addressed by straightforward use of any textbook-level technique. In fact, the presence of non-exhaustively defined set of classes violates basic assumptions for most supervised learning systems. The issue of non-exhaustively defined classes is the major obstacle for application of machine learning in phenotypic analysis since the number of possible phenotypes may be infinite. In our original proposal we argued that learning with a non-exhaustively defined set of classes remains a very challenging problem, and presented evidence demonstrating that simple extensions of standard techniques cannot provide an acceptable solution. Subsequently, we proposed a new approach based on Bayesian simulation of classes and showed that preliminary results outperformed benchmark techniques [4].  Although these initial results looked promising, we did not consider the described preliminary algorithms final and definitive, and we do not believe that at this point we are able to provide an exact algorithmic solution to this complex problem. If we were able to do that, it would mean that we had already accomplished all the grant goals. The very essence of the proposed research is finding the answer to the defined problem, and the answer will remain unknown until after the work has been done. However, positive reviews and an acceptance of our work by KDD'09 conference judges, tell us that we are heading in the right direction.  In the amended version of this application we propose a modified Bayesian approach based on Wishart priors (Section D.2.3). The algorithm creates new classes on the fly and evaluates maximum likelihood with the updated set of classes, gradually improving detection accuracy for future samples. We believe that this offers a substantial improvement over the previous method. Consequently, the preliminary results in Section C are updated to reflect our progress. Since the modified technique allows for classification with non-exhaustive and exhaustive sets using the same algorithm, we consolidated the previous specific aims 3 and 5 into one in the revised application.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A Machine Learning Approach to Label-free Detection of Bacterial Pathogens  using Laser Light Scattering  PIs: Dr. M.

"Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the introduction of Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine in 1796, vaccines have proven invaluable for their ability to stimulate the immune system and to confer protection against pathogenic organisms. Progress in modern vaccine research has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of vaccine-related papers in the published literature. It has become increasingly challenging to identify and annotate vaccine data from this large and diverse literature which no one scientist or team can fully master. Although vaccine databases exist that emphasize commercialized vaccines, no public central repository is available to store research data concerning commercial vaccines, vaccines in clinical trials, or vaccine candidates in early stages of development, in a fashion that render such data available for advanced analyses. To fill this need, we have developed VIOLIN (http://www.violinet.org), a web-based database system for annotation, storage, and analysis of published vaccine data. An ontology represents consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations, with associated definitions which are logically formulated in such a way as to promote automated reasoning. A bottleneck of vaccine research and further VIOLIN development is the lack of a vaccine ontology, which in turn makes a significant obstacle for vaccine data standardization, retrieval, integration, and advanced analysis and prediction. Our goal is to develop the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and apply it to efficient vaccine literature mining and analysis of protective immune mechanisms. We will focus on two model pathogens: Escherichia coli and Brucella species. This project contains three specific aims: (1) develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO), and apply it to establish a vaccine knowledgebase and to promote vaccine data integration and query through Semantic Web. The VO development will be achieved through collaboration with vaccine researchers, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Initiative, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO); (2) develop a VO-based natural language processing (NLP) system and apply it for more efficient retrieval of Brucella and E. coli vaccine information, automated annotation of journal articles with VO terms, and VO improvement. This task will be achieved by collaboration with the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). (3) analyze and predict vaccine targets and protective immune networks attributable to the interactions between host and vaccine. This will be achieved mainly by VO-based literature mining and a novel genome- and literature-based statistical methodology. This project will be implemented by a strong collaborative team and supported from a large user community. The Vaccine Ontology and its applications to literature mining and for studying protective immunity against Brucella spp. and E. coli will lay a strong foundation for further advanced informatics research on vaccines against infectious diseases in the post-genomics and information era.            Narrative: Vaccines stimulate the immune system and confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms. A bottleneck of vaccine research is the lack of an ontology (consensus- based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations) to ensure consistency of literature curation and support automated reasoning.

"Robust BCT for Clinical Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a major public health threat for over 50% of the population over age 50. Despite its importance, osteoporosis is largely under-treated, with less than 20% of those recommended for testing being screened. With substantial reimbursement cuts being introduced by Medicare for bone densitometry by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, the current clinical standard), with a sensitivity of DXA for fracture prediction of less than 50%, and with the rapidly increasing size of the aging population of the U.S., there is an urgent need for additional and more sensitive modalities than DXA for clinical assessment of fracture risk. Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT) has emerged as a powerful alternative to DXA. This CT-based technology creates a structural ""finite element"" model of a patient's bone from their CT scans, and subjects that model to virtual forces in order to provide an estimate of the strength of the bone. Well validated in cadaver studies and being a better predictor of bone strength than is bone mineral density by DXA, BCT has also been shown to be highly predictive of osteoporotic fractures in clinical research studies. However, robustness remains an issue - can the technique be used easily by non-experts in research and clinical environments? Addressing this issue, the overall goal of this research is to improve the robustness of our software, such that it can automatically analyze scans from a wide range of CT scanners and using a wide variety of CT acquisition protocols, including new low-dose protocols that limit radiation exposure to the patient. Such a robust BCT diagnostic tool could then be offered as a supplementary ""add-on"" analysis to many types of CT exams taken for other purposes such as CT colonography, pelvic, abdominal, and spine exams, thus reducing hospital costs, incurring no addition radiation to the patient, requiring no change in the CT acquisition protocols, and therefore greatly increasing the number of patients that could be screened at low cost. Specifically, we propose in this Phase-I project to combine expertise in computer vision, CT scanning, and biomechanics in order to develop an automated method of ""phantomless"" cross-calibration of CT scans for robust vertebral strength assessment. Focusing on the spine, our major tasks are to perform a series of clinical studies in which patients are scanned twice using a variety of CT acquisition protocols; develop a custom external-calibration phantom and use that to determine the effects of various CT acquisition parameters on scanning standardization; and use machine learning techniques to develop a ""statistical atlas"" of the spine for automation of all image processing. We will combine these efforts to develop a phantomless BCT method that accounts for differences in image quality due to variations in CT scanners and acquisition protocols, including low-dose protocols, and that does so in a highly automated fashion requiring minimal user expertise and input. Should this project be successful, future work will further refine the techniques, extend them to the hip and quantitative analysis of muscle and other soft tissues, and address robustness of longitudinal changes for clinical monitoring.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With a mortality rate up to 30% one year after hip fracture, and an economic burden exceeding $17 billion annually, osteoporotic fracture is a debilitating condition whose impact on our aging society is growing. Early identification of those at risk for fracture can guide prevention and treatment, and BCT will provide a means for such detection with a sensitivity and specificity lacking in DXA based bone densitometry. The greater radiation exposure from CT, however, limits the market for such a diagnostic. The proposed project will result in a robust diagnostic test that significantly lowers radiation dose to the patient, and in some implementations, completely eliminates additional radiation by using CT scans already ordered for other medical purposes. Successful development of this product will broaden the pool of individuals who will benefit from a more accurate and sensitive fracture risk prediction, expand the market for O. N. Diagnostics' business, and result in an important advance in the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.           Statement of Relevance With a mortality rate up to 30% one year after hip fracture, and an economic burden exceeding $17 billion annually, osteoporotic fracture is a debilitating condition whose impact on our aging society is growing.

"Integrated Cardio-Renal Risk Prediction Models in Type 1 Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application addresses broad Challenge Area (03) Biomarker Discovery and Validation, and the specific Challenge Topic that this application addresses is: 03-DK-101 Discovery of biomarkers for disease risk, progression or response to therapy in diseases of interest to NIDDK. The Challenge: Despite tremendous progress in treatment, patients with type 1 diabetes continue to die 15 years earlier, experience excess morbidity and have medical costs over 10 times higher than the general population. The risk of coronary artery disease and diabetic nephropathy is still greatly increased and responsible for 80% of deaths in these patients. Diabetic nephropathy and coronary artery disease are intertwined, suggesting common pathways, and yet current risk prediction is inadequate. Study Rationale: Nearly 25% of T1D patients develop end-stage renal disease. The conventional theory is that the sequence of events leading to diabetic nephropathy begins from microalbuminuria, progressing to overt proteinuria and eventual end-stage renal disease. Primary prevention with ACE/ARB treatment usually begins when persistent microalbuminuria is found. However, recent prospective studies using serial measurements of kidney function estimated from serum cystatin C have changed this paradigm by demonstrating that decline in glomerular filtration may begin in the absence of microalbuminuria or continue despite remission of microalbuminuria. By their mid 40's, over 70% of men and 50% of women with type 1 diabetes develop coronary artery calcification (CAC) - a marker of significant atherosclerotic plaque burden. Cardiovascular disease is particularly prevalent among patients with renal disease, but most cardiac events occur in patients with normal albumin excretion rates. Evidence has accumulated that diabetic nephropathy and CAC are parallel, rather than sequential, complications of type 1 diabetes, sharing a number of important predictors. Accurate prediction of the individual's global cardio-renal risk is needed to guide treatment choices. As a result, there is a recognized need for better risk partitioning, either from the discovery of additional biomarkers or the application of superior methods for discrimination of disease states. Our Approach: We are proposing to use the biobank of 652 adults with type 1 diabetes who have been thoroughly genotyped and prospectively followed for development of diabetic nephropathy and coronary artery disease by the Coronary Artery Calcification in Type 1 Diabetes study (CACTI, R01 HL61753, 1999- 2009) to develop and validate integrated biomarker prediction models for cardio-renal complications in type 1 diabetes. Our study aims are the investigation of biomarkers within the well-characterized CACTI cohort for 1) early progressive renal function decline, 2) the presence and progression of coronary artery calcium, and the 3) development of combined renal and cardiovascular disease burden. Renal disease and coronary artery disease (CAD) are the leading causes of death among adults with type 1 diabetes, but traditional screening tests (urinary albumin and serum creatinine) for renal disease are inadequate, and traditional CAD risk factors (dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking, obesity) do not fully explain the increased burden of disease associated with type 1 diabetes. Renal and cardiovascular complications are intertwined, suggesting shared pathways. Increased systemic inflammation is present in type 1 diabetes and inflammatory mediators such as uric acid, vitamin D and bone metabolism markers have been suggested to play a role in both renal and cardiovascular diseases. As a result, it is of critical public health importance to discover and validate new biomarkers for cardio-renal disease among adults with type 1 diabetes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Renal disease and coronary artery disease (CAD) are the leading causes of death among adults with type 1 diabetes, but traditional screening tests (urinary albumin and serum creatinine) for renal disease are inadequate, and traditional CAD risk factors (dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking, obesity) do not fully explain the increased burden of disease associated with type 1 diabetes.

"Toward Individually-tailored Medicine: Probabilistic Models of Cerebral Aneurysms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding, both from incidental discovery on imaging studies and on autopsy; it is estimated that anywhere from 1-6% of the American population will develop this problem. Unfortunately, while our ability to detect ICAs has grown, our fundamental understanding of this disease entity remains lacking and significant debate continues in regards to its treatment. Given the high degree of mortality and comorbidity associated with ruptured intracranial aneurysms, it is imperative that new insights and approaches be developed to inform medical decision making involving ICAs. Thus, the objective of this proposal is the creation of an informatics infrastructure to help elucidate the genesis, progression, and treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Building from our efforts from the previous R01, a set of technical developments is outlined to transform the array of information routinely collected from clinical as- sessment of ICA patients into a Bayesian belief network (BBN) that models the disease. First, we evolve the concept of a phenomenon-centric data model (PCDM) as the basis for (temporally) organizing clinically-derived observations, enabling the model to be associated with processing pipelines that can identify and transform targeted variables from the content of clinical data sources. Through these pipelines, specific values in free- text reports (radiology, surgery, pathology, discharge summaries) and imaging studies will be automatically extracted into a scientific-quality database. Second, the PCDM schema for ICAs is mapped to a Bayesian belief network: the linkage between the PCDM and BBN allows automatic updating of the network and its progressive refinement from a growing dataset. The BBN's topology will be determined by clinical experts and conditional probabilities computed from the extracted clinical data. A basic graphical user interface (GUI) will permit users to interact with the BBN, aiding in medical decision making tasks. The GUI will allow a clinician to pose questions from either a set of common clinical queries or to create new queries: loading a patient's medical record into this application will automatically populate BBN variables with extracted information (i.e., from the pipelines). Each technical component of this proposal will be evaluated in a laboratory setting. In addition, the BBN will be tested for its predictive capabilities and compared to other statistical models to assess its potential in guiding ICA treatment. This proposal leverages a clinical collaboration with the UCLA Division of Interventional Neuroradiology, a leader in ICA research and treatment. A combined dataset of 2,000 retrospective and prospective subjects will be used to create the ICA database and BBN. Data collection will encompass a comprehensive set of variables including clinical presentation, imaging assessment (morphology, hemodynamics), histopathology, gene expression, treatment, and outcomes. We will additionally leverage the NIH/NINDS Human Genetic DNA and Cell Line Repository for additional ICA-related data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding on routine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) neuro-imaging studies. The associated mortality rate and comorbidity resultant from ruptured ICAs are extreme: subarachnoid hemorrhage causes 50% of individuals to die within one month of rupture, and more than one third of survivors develop major neurological deficits. Hence, the focus of this re- search is the creation of a comprehensive research database for ICA patients, using the spectrum of data routinely acquired in the diagnosis and treatment of the problem; from this database, a new probabilistic model of ICAs will be created, providing new insights into the disease and its optimal treatment for a given individual.           PROGRAM NARRATIVE Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding on routine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) neuro-imaging studies.

"Real-Time MRI Motion Correction System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MOTIVATION - Motion remains one of the most frequent contributors to image artifacts in MR studies.  The motion susceptibility of MRI is well-known and has spawned a number of elegant navigation techniques.  These methods, however, are tailored to specific MR acquisitions that require modified k-space trajectories or the acquisition of additional MR data, and most are unable to correct certain types of motion, for example, through-plane motion.  Moreover, motion correction has been focused on specific families of sequences, but no generally applicable approach currently exists.  Certain patient populations, such as pediatric or geriatric patients, are more likely to move than others.  In pediatric imaging, anesthesia is used to control motion, adding substantially to exam costs and patient risks.  A sequence-independent, autonomous and prospective motion correction system could greatly improve image quality for a wide spectrum of MR examinations.  For pediatric imaging, in particular, we anticipate reduced reliance on anesthesia to control patient motion.  AIMS - We will be focusing on three independent specific aims (carried out in parallel and completed within 4 years), with corresponding subaims that we believe are important for establishing the technical/scientific merit and to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed R&D efforts for our real-time adaptive motion correction approach.  Specifically, these aims are:  (1) to develop and evaluate a coil-mounted MR-compatible tracking device for routine clinical use; (2) to integrate pose tracking into real-time MRI; and (3) to validate our real-time motion correction system in volunteers and patients.  METHODS -In Aim 1 we will improve the methods for computer-vision-based pose estimation inside an MR scanner and build an MR-compatible coil-mounted pose tracker that can be used in clinical routine examinations.  In Aim 2 we will focus on reducing the latency between pose changes happening and the MR scanner reacting to these pose changes, and on building a software library for the MR pulse sequence development that allows one to implement real-time motion correction into all MR pulse sequences.  In Aim 3 we will perform a thorough evaluation of our system on 60 volunteers (30 adults and 30 children) and 120 patients (80 adults and 40 children).  SIGNIFICANCE - The impact of our technology has several facets.  First, it will improve patient care by reducing the number of MR images with compromised quality because of motion artifacts.  Especially because of the increasing reliance on MR Images as a primary means of diagnosis, this will reduce the number of misdiagnoses.  Secondly, this technology will help to lower the high national spending on imaging by dramatically improving the efficiency of MRI scanners.  Finally, it will improve patient comfort by reducing the need for repeat sequences, as well as reduce the necessity of sedation aimed at keeping the patient still.  Overall, this technology will have a significant impact on MRI both in clinical practice and basic science research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Synopsis Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.  This is not only of increasing concern due to the aging population and its associated diseases, but also in children and patients who are simply too sick to remain still during an exam.  This proposal aims to build an optical tracking system and methods to adapt MRI pulse sequences to changes in patient pose in real time.  The project leverages on previous work from an R21 project in which a prototype system was successfully built.  Specifically, the aims are to (i) introduce innovative improvements to the existing prototype, making the system suitable for use in clinical routine, (ii) modify the optical tracking system to be compatible with multiple MR sequences, and (iii) perform clinical evaluation.  Our real-time technique is a unique and innovative solution that will improve MRI image quality and thus patient care, and will address the escalating burden of imaging costs on the health care system.              Synopsis  Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.

"Integrating Quantitative Histological Image and Vascular Density Patterns for Pro    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       With increasing detection of early CaP with improved diagnostic methodologies, it has become important to predict biologic behaviors and ""aggressivity"" to identify patients who might benefit from a ""wait and watch policy"" as opposed to those who need more aggressive strategies. Traditionally, T-stage, amount of cancer in the core biopsy, the Gleason grade, and PSA at diagnosis has been used to evaluate the prognosis in localized CaP. While the Gleason score is currently assumed to be the strongest prognostic marker for CaP, there is often considerably high inter-, intra-observer variability associated with Gleason grade determination by pathologists. While some newer markers have recently shown promise, none of these methods have individually proven to be accurate enough to serve routinely as a prognostic marker for CaP.  Recently, there has been a call to combine multiple prognostic markers to create an integrated meta-marker, with potentially greater accuracy in predicting CaP recurrence compared to any individual marker. While it is apparent that prognostic information resides in histopathology imagery in terms of the arrangement of nuclei and glands, sophisticated graph, and computerized image analysis algorithms are required to quantitatively model and characterize the architectural appearance of prostate cancer histopathology and thus provide a marker that is accurate and reproducible (unlike Gleason grade). In addition, while tumor micro-vascular density has been correlated to CaP outcome, prognostic information may also potentially reside in the specific spatial architectural arrangement of the micro-vascular network. The objective of the proposed work is to develop an integrated quantitative prognostic marker that combines information based on architectural arrangement of nuclear, glandular, and micro-vasculature network patterns on whole mount histology sections (WMHS) obtained via radical prostatectomy (RP) to predict prostate cancer recurrence.  The proposed work comprises a total of 3 specific aims. For this project we will digitize approximately 100 annonymized WMHS obtained via RP that have been matched for Gleason score, stage, PSA, but with different clinical outcomes (half the patients having undergone cancer recurrence and the other not, following RP). Under Aim 1, segmentation algorithms will be developed to automatically identify cancerous nuclei, glands and tumor microvasculature (MV), stained immuno-histochemically via CD31. Under Aim 2 we will apply graph based image analysis algorithms to quantitatively characterize the architectural arrangement of CaP nuclei, glands and the MV network. These graph-based features will be integrated via a computerized machine learning algorithm to yield a numerical image based risk score (IbRiS) reflecting the CaP prognosis (disease recurrence or non-recurrence) of the patient. IbRiS will be evaluated in terms of its ability to distinguish between CaP progressors and non-progressors (matched for stage, Gleason grade, PSA), in a cohort of 50 independent studies (test set) for which survival and outcome data is available.  This project will be a collaboration between investigators at Rutgers University (RU) and the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN). Data accrual will be done at UPENN while algorithmic development for computerized image analysis and classification will be carried out at RU.             The broad long term goal of this project is to develop an integrated image based histological biomarker for  predicting  prostate  cancer  (CaP)  survival  and  outcome  by  integrating  quantitative  image  signatures  that  define  tissue  architecture  and  vascular  density  patterns.  Sophisticated  image  analysis  and  graph  based  algorithms will be developed to yield an image based risk score (IbRis) to predict whether or not a CaP patient  will  have  disease  recurrence  following  treatment.  Our  hypothesis  is  that  IbRis  will  prove  to  be  a  better  prognostic marker compared to such traditional markers as Gleason score and PSA.

"Clinical Image Retrieval: User needs assessment, toolbox development & evaluation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Advances in digital imaging technologies have led to a substantial growth in the number of digital images being created and stored in hospitals, medical systems, and on the Internet in recent years. Effective medical image retrieval systems can play an important role in teaching, research, diagnosis and treatment. Images were historically retrieved using text-based methods. The quality of annotations associated with images can reduce the effectiveness of text-based image retrieval. Despite recent advances, purely content- based image retrieval techniques lag significantly behind their textual counterparts in their ability to capture the semantic essence of the user's query. Preliminary research suggests that a more promising approach is to adaptively combine these complementary techniques to suit the user and their information needs. However, for these approaches to succeed, the researcher needs to enhance her computational skills in addition to acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the relevant clinical domain. This Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) grant application describes a training and career development plan that will allow the candidate, an NLM postdoctoral fellow in Medical Informatics at Oregon Health & Science University to achieve these objectives. The training component will be carried out under the mentorship of Dr. W. Hersh with Dr. Gorman (user studies). Dr. Fuss (radiation medicine) and Dr. Erdogmus (machine learning) providing additional mentoring in their areas of expertise.       The long-term goal of this Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) project is to improve visual information retrieval by better understanding user needs and proposing adaptive methodologies for multimodal image retrieval that will close the semantic gap. During the award period, activities will be focused on the following specific aims: (1) Understand the image retrieval needs of novice and expert users in radiation oncology and develop gold standards for evaluation; (2) Develop algorithms for semantic, multimodal image retrieval; (3) Perform user based evaluation of adaptive image retrieval in radiation oncology; (4) Extend the techniques developed to create a multimodal image retrieval system in pathology          n/a","Clinical Image Retrieval: User needs assessment, toolbox development & evaluation",7739714,K99LM009889,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Applications Grants', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Award', 'Back', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion', 'Distance Learning', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image retrieval system', 'Imaging technology', 'Information Retrieval', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric System', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Needs Assessment', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Oregon', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality Control', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer site', 'care delivery', 'career development', 'data mining', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'improved', 'meetings', 'oncology', 'open source', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'visual information']",NLM,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K99,2009,104963,304670088,0.001905517512641188
"Early Acute Lung Injury: Prospective Evaluation Prior to Respiratory Failure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Acute lung injury (ALI) is a syndrome of acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to pulmonary and non-pulmonary insults and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite two decades of targeted investigation by the NHLBI, little is known about ALI prior to progression to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Accordingly, the aims of this research plan are to: 1) prospectively identify independent predictors of progression to ALI requiring mechanical ventilation and establish a clinical definition of early ALI; 2) evaluate the pathogenetic role of biologic markers of inflammation and lung injury and their value for refining risk stratification of patients at risk for progression to ALI, and 3) test the potential therapeutic value of an aerosolized beta-2 agonist in patients with early ALI. In SPECIFIC AIM 1 will identify cases of potential early ALI by screening chest radiographs of all adult emergency department and medicine service admissions. Patients admitted to the hospital with bilateral opacities on chest radiograph not due to isolated left atrial hypertension will be followed for progression to ALI during their hospitalization. Clinical characteristics (demographics, diagnoses, comorbidities, vital signs, and Borg dyspnea scores) will be recorded for the first 72 hours of admission. Independent predictors of progression to ALI will be determined by multivariate logistic regression and incorporated into a clinical definition of early ALI. In SPECIFIC AIM 2, plasma levels of biomarkers (IL-8, sTNFr-1, vWF, ICAM-1, SP-D and RAGE) representing distinct pathways contributing to acute lung injury will be measured at time 0 and 24 hours after study enrollment. Biomarkers will be analyzed by multivariate regression analysis to assess their value for stratifying patients at risk for progression to ALI and provide mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of early ALI. In SPECIFIC AIM 3 I will conduct a randomized clinical trial of aerosoUzed albuterol vs. placebo in patients with early ALI. The primary endpoint will be the Pa02 / Fi02 on day 4 of treatment. Secondary outcome measures will be rate of progression to ALI and change in plasma biologic marker levels. This will be a first-of-its-kind trial to establish that patients with early ALI can be identified and treatment can be initiated prior to need for mechanical ventilation. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Following the paradigm of early goal-directed therapy for severe sepsis, clinical benefit may derive from identifying patients with early ALI and initiating treatment prior to the need for mechanical ventilation (and therefore prior to meeting current study entry criteria). Establishing evidence based clinical definition of early ALI will facilitate identification and risk stratification of subjects for enrollment in future clinical trials.

"AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 1 million people in the US will experience a heart attack or sudden cardiac death. A large percentage of these patients have no prior symptoms of any kind but suffer from silent heart disease (ischemia), which may cause a heart attack at any time. Currently there is no reliable screening method to identify people who may have silent heart disease and therefore are at risk of ""heart attack"".       We seek to extract additional data from a non-invasive Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the heart (commonly used in most imaging centers), which will better identify patients who are ""vulnerable"" to sudden heart attack. These images are acquired without contrast agents, as a common screening test for measuring coronary calcium, another clinical marker of coronary artery disease. We will prove that additional information about cardiovascular risk can be obtained by quantifying pericardial fat surrounding the heart in these cardiac CT images. Although this information exists in the cardiac CT scans acquired today, it is ignored in clinical practice because currently there are no tools to measure it automatically and reliably, and no information regarding its significance for a given patient.       We will develop fully automated, accurate, new computer software for quantitation of pericardial fat from cardiac CT images acquired for routine assessment of coronary calcium. We plan to achieve complete automation and accuracy, by applying a combination of robust and effective algorithms in machine learning with anatomical knowledge. We aim to prove that the developed automatic software will be as accurate, and more reproducible than experienced imaging physicians in quantifying pericardial fat, and will accomplish the measurement in a fraction of the time. Such software could be immediately made available worldwide to standard imaging workstations. For the first time, this will allow its use as a standard practical imaging tool for cardiovascular risk assessment, without requiring additional time, imaging or radiation risk to the patient.       We will also show that this new quantitative information has important additional value compared to other clinical cardiovascular risk factors and information from blood samples (such as cholesterol, glucose and CRP), and the amount of calcium in the patient's coronary arteries seen on CT scans, and establish its significance in the prediction of silent heart disease.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This new research will allow accurate prediction of who might be more likely to have heart disease which may ultimately cause a heart attack. It will allow doctors to identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed to avoid a heart attack, or more extensive testing, could be recommended, to confirm or rule out heart disease.          n/a",AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR,7588839,R21EB006829,"['Abdomen', 'Algorithms', 'Automation', 'Biochemical', 'Blood specimen', 'C-reactive protein', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patients', 'Pericardial body location', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Radiation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visceral', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'indexing', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool', 'waist circumference']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2009,196375,90419233,0.007846102314499144
"A New Paradigm for Integrated Analysis of Multiscale Genomic Imaging Datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A decade ago when microarray was first invented, it was hailed as ""an array of hope"" in Nature Genetics and has received a considerable amount of attention in biomedicine. Subsequently it has been called ""an array of problems"" in Nature Review. An inherent problem with microarray gene expression is that structural information is missing, which limits its ability in biological discovery. To overcome the poor reproducibility and accuracy of microarray imaging, there needs to be a shift in fundamental paradigms to those able to incorporate complementary and multiscale structural imaging information into microarray imaging. Fortunately, the latest progress in high resolution biomolecular imaging probe development coupled with advanced image analysis makes integrative and systematic studies of cellular systems possible. A cell can be labeled using multiscale and multimodality imaging, providing both structural and functional information. With multiscale imaging spreadsheets now available, there is an overwhelming need within the life sciences community to manage this information effectively, to analyze it comprehensively, and to apply the resulting knowledge in the understanding of the genetic system of a cell. However, the management and mining of this large-scale imaging information is limited by today's computational approaches and knowledge-sharing infrastructure. These problems represent a major impediment to progress in the emerging area of bio-molecular image informatics. Therefore, the goal of this project is to develop a unique genomic image management and mining system that can allow geneticists to search, correlate and integrate this multiscale and multi-modality imaging information in an easily operable fashion and further enable new biological discovery. In particular, this system will fill a void left in the current image database systems such as Open Microscope Environment (OME), e.g., the lack of analytic tools for integrative data analysis. To realize this goal, we are bringing together a strong interdisciplinary team consisting of imaging engineers, geneticists and industrial imaging scientists. Building on our diverse and complementary expertise, we are able to provide innovative and interdisciplinary approaches that combine the latest progress in image processing, imaging database design and machine learning with the development of high resolution and high throughput molecular imaging probes in genomics. More specifically, we will accomplish the following specific aims. First, we will develop a suite of algorithms for content extraction and information retrieval from high resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) images. This visual system will effectively manage imaging phenotype information, facilitating knowledge discovery such as identifying visually similar subtypes. Second, we will correlate quantitative traits extracted from FISH imaging with genomic structural rearrangements and gene expression patterns. Finally, we will develop a data integration approach to fuse disparate information from multi-modality imaging databases for improved characterization of biological systems.               Public Health Relevance Statement The anticipated outcome of the project will include a publicly accessible imaging database analysis system to facilitate multiscale genomic image information integration and knowledge mining. The proposed approach challenges the current paradigm by the integration of high resolution structural imaging with functional information, which promises to overcome the poor accuracy and reproducibility problems plagued with microarray imaging. Given the ubiquitous use of microarray imaging in biomedicine, the project is thus expected to be of great impact on the biomedical community.",A New Paradigm for Integrated Analysis of Multiscale Genomic Imaging Datasets,7641582,R21LM010042,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Blast Cell', 'Cells', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Classification', 'Comb animal structure', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Coupled', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'Hybridization Array', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Karyotype', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Microscope', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Prevention', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biological systems', 'complex biological systems', 'data integration', 'database design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder prevention', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'image processing', 'imaging informatics', 'imaging modality', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'knowledge of results', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'mutant', 'public health relevance', 'structural genomics', 'tool', 'trait', 'visual map']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI KANSAS CITY,R21,2009,219972,6895409,-0.007770145451850701
"Accurate detection of chromosomal abnormalities with multi-color image processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The combination of high resolution assays in genomics with microscopic imaging has been used for the detection of complex chromosomal rearrangements, a significant but difficult problem in prenatal and postnatal diagnosis, birth defect detection and cancer research. As a recently developed molecular cytogenetic technique, multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) imaging has provided rapid and high resolution detection of chromosomal abnormalities associated with cancer and genetic disorders. However, the technique is currently limited to research use and only serves as an adjunct tool to the G-banding based monochromatic chromosomal karyotyping in a clinical laboratory. A primary barrier of the technique is the lower classification accuracy when classifying chromosomes from multi-color microscopic imaging data. Therefore, the goal of this R15 project is to develop innovative multi-spectral image processing and machine learning techniques for M-FISH image analysis so that chromosomal rearrangement detection can be made more reproducible, robust, and faster, thereby significantly increasing the ability and efficacy of this newly developed cellular imaging technique. Our proposed approaches such as multiscale feature extraction, nonlinear manifold analysis and adaptive fuzzy clustering are able to target specific features of multi-spectral imaging data, promising a significant improvement over the current techniques. In order to validate the technique and bring it into clinical use, we will partner with a clinical geneticist, Dr. Merlin Butler, and a cytogeneticist, Dr. Diane Persons both at Kansas University Medical Center. In addition, we will collaborate with an industrial scientist, Dr. Kenneth Castleman, who is the pioneer in developing and commercializing cytogenetic imaging products. Through our interdisciplinary research and collaboration, we will accomplish the following specific aims: 1) develop image normalization approaches to improve the acquisition of multi-color FISH images; 2) develop multiscale dimension analysis to extract features from multi-color images; 3) design adaptive fuzzy clustering and incorporate contextual information to improve the pixel-wise classification of chromosomes; and 4) validate computational approaches with clinical testing in collaboration with medical and industrial partners. This research project will also enhance our research infrastructure in biomedical image informatics and provide undergraduate and graduate students opportunities to touch the frontier of molecular and cellular imaging by participating in the proposed research activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Unraveling complex rearrangements using cytogenetic approaches such as M-FISH imaging has been extremely useful in prenatal, postnatal and cancer diagnoses. Our proposed approaches have the potential to significantly improve the reliability of the newly developed M-FISH imaging technique, making it feasible for clinical use. This will in turn benefit the health of human beings. Furthermore, the developed computational techniques can be applicable to a wide range of multi-color bio-imaging problems, thereby having a broad impact on the biomedical community.           Project Narrative Unraveling complex rearrangements using cytogenetic approaches such as M-FISH imaging has been extremely useful in prenatal, postnatal and cancer diagnoses.

"Identifying network pertubation using secreted protein profiles in glioblastoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project is focused both on career development and on the completion of a specific independent research plan related particularly to the mission of the National Cancer Institute. The career development objective of this award is to enable the transition of Dr. Nathan Price from his current position as a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Systems Biology to an assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign capable of competing for independent funding in cancer research. Dr. Price has an exceptionally strong track record in systems biology for his career stage, having co-authored over 20 articles for publication in his graduate studies as well as completing significant cancer-related studies during his postdoctoral training. Dr. Price accepted a faculty position at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign prior to finishing graduate school, but chose to defer this position for 2-3 years for the express purpose of transitioning his career focus onto systems analysis of cancer. The mentored phase of this award will provide Dr. Price with the opportunity to receive guidance from one of the leading scientists in the world working on systems approaches to cancer, Dr. Leroy Hood, who is President of the Institute for Systems Biology, Director of the Center for Systems Biology, and Co-Director of the Nanosystems Biology Cancer Center. Dr. Price's proposed research focuses on developing a novel capability to identify causal network perturbations involved in glioblastoma through analysis of patterns in secreted protein concentrations. This work will also focus on studying the relationship between transcriptomic data (which is plentiful) with secreted protein data (which serve as ideal diagnostic markers). The associated measurements of secreted proteins will provide a wealth of candidate markers for glioblastomas, and a team of glioblastoma researchers has been assembled to assist in translating the work of this project to the clinic (to be financed elsewhere). The ultimate long-term goal of this work is to develop highly informative secreted protein marker panels for glioblastoma multiforme, the most aggressive and deadly form of glioma. The use of systems analysis of blood, coupled with computational models of interacting networks such as will be developed in this-study, has the long-term potential not only of identifying perturbed networks in vivo, but eventually of enabling a new avenue of studying human biology and disease in vivo in a non-invasive manner.      The relevance of this work to public health is that specific secreted protein markers for glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer common particularly in children, will be developed where none exist today. These rnarkers will allow for the earlier diagnosis and hence better prognosis of patients, and will be far less irjvasive than the brain biopsy currently required to diagnose advanced gliomas. Also, we will identify perturbed subnetworks in the most aggressive type of glioma (glioblastoma multiforme) leading to potential drug targets for further analysis.                    n/a",Identifying network pertubation using secreted protein profiles in glioblastoma,7917085,R00CA126184,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens', 'Arts', 'Astrocytes', 'Atlases', 'Australia', 'Award', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Proteins', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Breast', 'Buffers', 'Calibration', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer cell line', 'Caseins', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Core Facility', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Culture Media', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Dissociation', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug usage', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Essential Amino Acids', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Film', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Glean', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Halobacterium', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Humidity', 'IGFBP2 gene', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunization', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Incubated', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Institutes', 'Ions', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-out', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Linear Regressions', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Location', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurosciences', 'Nutritional', 'Ontology', 'Organ', 'Organ Specificity', 'Outcome', 'PTEN gene', 'Pacific Northwest', 'Participant', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Personal Communication', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Printing', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Fingerprints', 'Protein-Protein Interaction Map', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Refractive Indices', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Running', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Serum-Free Culture Media', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stable Isotope Labeling', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transfection', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'analog', 'base', 'biological systems', 'candidate marker', 'cell growth', 'cell type', 'chemokine', 'clinical application', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'cross reactivity', 'cytokine', 'dalton', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exhaust', 'follow-up', 'glioma cell line', 'halobacteria', 'immortalized cell', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'knock-down', 'knowledge base', 'light intensity', 'macrophage', 'mass spectrometer', 'multiple reaction monitoring', 'nanosystems', 'network models', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oligodendroglioma', 'polyclonal antibody', 'preference', 'processing speed', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protein expression', 'protein profiling', 'protein protein interaction', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'response', 'sarcoma', 'technology development', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R00,2009,249000,76545728,-0.04356804679757365
"Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the introduction of Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine in 1796, vaccines have proven invaluable for their ability to stimulate the immune system and to confer protection against pathogenic organisms. Progress in modern vaccine research has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of vaccine-related papers in the published literature. It has become increasingly challenging to identify and annotate vaccine data from this large and diverse literature which no one scientist or team can fully master. Although vaccine databases exist that emphasize commercialized vaccines, no public central repository is available to store research data concerning commercial vaccines, vaccines in clinical trials, or vaccine candidates in early stages of development, in a fashion that render such data available for advanced analyses. To fill this need, we have developed VIOLIN (http://www.violinet.org), a web-based database system for annotation, storage, and analysis of published vaccine data. An ontology represents consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations, with associated definitions which are logically formulated in such a way as to promote automated reasoning. A bottleneck of vaccine research and further VIOLIN development is the lack of a vaccine ontology, which in turn makes a significant obstacle for vaccine data standardization, retrieval, integration, and advanced analysis and prediction. Our goal is to develop the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and apply it to efficient vaccine literature mining and analysis of protective immune mechanisms. We will focus on two model pathogens: Escherichia coli and Brucella species. This project contains three specific aims: (1) develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO), and apply it to establish a vaccine knowledgebase and to promote vaccine data integration and query through Semantic Web. The VO development will be achieved through collaboration with vaccine researchers, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Initiative, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO); (2) develop a VO-based natural language processing (NLP) system and apply it for more efficient retrieval of Brucella and E. coli vaccine information, automated annotation of journal articles with VO terms, and VO improvement. This task will be achieved by collaboration with the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). (3) analyze and predict vaccine targets and protective immune networks attributable to the interactions between host and vaccine. This will be achieved mainly by VO-based literature mining and a novel genome- and literature-based statistical methodology. This project will be implemented by a strong collaborative team and supported from a large user community. The Vaccine Ontology and its applications to literature mining and for studying protective immunity against Brucella spp. and E. coli will lay a strong foundation for further advanced informatics research on vaccines against infectious diseases in the post-genomics and information era.            Narrative: Vaccines stimulate the immune system and confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms. A bottleneck of vaccine research is the lack of an ontology (consensus- based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations) to ensure consistency of literature curation and support automated reasoning.

"Robust BCT for Clinical Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a major public health threat for over 50% of the population over age 50. Despite its importance, osteoporosis is largely under-treated, with less than 20% of those recommended for testing being screened. With substantial reimbursement cuts being introduced by Medicare for bone densitometry by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, the current clinical standard), with a sensitivity of DXA for fracture prediction of less than 50%, and with the rapidly increasing size of the aging population of the U.S., there is an urgent need for additional and more sensitive modalities than DXA for clinical assessment of fracture risk. Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT) has emerged as a powerful alternative to DXA. This CT-based technology creates a structural ""finite element"" model of a patient's bone from their CT scans, and subjects that model to virtual forces in order to provide an estimate of the strength of the bone. Well validated in cadaver studies and being a better predictor of bone strength than is bone mineral density by DXA, BCT has also been shown to be highly predictive of osteoporotic fractures in clinical research studies. However, robustness remains an issue - can the technique be used easily by non-experts in research and clinical environments? Addressing this issue, the overall goal of this research is to improve the robustness of our software, such that it can automatically analyze scans from a wide range of CT scanners and using a wide variety of CT acquisition protocols, including new low-dose protocols that limit radiation exposure to the patient. Such a robust BCT diagnostic tool could then be offered as a supplementary ""add-on"" analysis to many types of CT exams taken for other purposes such as CT colonography, pelvic, abdominal, and spine exams, thus reducing hospital costs, incurring no addition radiation to the patient, requiring no change in the CT acquisition protocols, and therefore greatly increasing the number of patients that could be screened at low cost. Specifically, we propose in this Phase-I project to combine expertise in computer vision, CT scanning, and biomechanics in order to develop an automated method of ""phantomless"" cross-calibration of CT scans for robust vertebral strength assessment. Focusing on the spine, our major tasks are to perform a series of clinical studies in which patients are scanned twice using a variety of CT acquisition protocols; develop a custom external-calibration phantom and use that to determine the effects of various CT acquisition parameters on scanning standardization; and use machine learning techniques to develop a ""statistical atlas"" of the spine for automation of all image processing. We will combine these efforts to develop a phantomless BCT method that accounts for differences in image quality due to variations in CT scanners and acquisition protocols, including low-dose protocols, and that does so in a highly automated fashion requiring minimal user expertise and input. Should this project be successful, future work will further refine the techniques, extend them to the hip and quantitative analysis of muscle and other soft tissues, and address robustness of longitudinal changes for clinical monitoring.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With a mortality rate up to 30% one year after hip fracture, and an economic burden exceeding $17 billion annually, osteoporotic fracture is a debilitating condition whose impact on our aging society is growing. Early identification of those at risk for fracture can guide prevention and treatment, and BCT will provide a means for such detection with a sensitivity and specificity lacking in DXA based bone densitometry. The greater radiation exposure from CT, however, limits the market for such a diagnostic. The proposed project will result in a robust diagnostic test that significantly lowers radiation dose to the patient, and in some implementations, completely eliminates additional radiation by using CT scans already ordered for other medical purposes. Successful development of this product will broaden the pool of individuals who will benefit from a more accurate and sensitive fracture risk prediction, expand the market for O. N. Diagnostics' business, and result in an important advance in the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.           Statement of Relevance With a mortality rate up to 30% one year after hip fracture, and an economic burden exceeding $17 billion annually, osteoporotic fracture is a debilitating condition whose impact on our aging society is growing.

"Toward Individually-tailored Medicine: Probabilistic Models of Cerebral Aneurysms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding, both from incidental discovery on imaging studies and on autopsy; it is estimated that anywhere from 1-6% of the American population will develop this problem. Unfortunately, while our ability to detect ICAs has grown, our fundamental understanding of this disease entity remains lacking and significant debate continues in regards to its treatment. Given the high degree of mortality and comorbidity associated with ruptured intracranial aneurysms, it is imperative that new insights and approaches be developed to inform medical decision making involving ICAs. Thus, the objective of this proposal is the creation of an informatics infrastructure to help elucidate the genesis, progression, and treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Building from our efforts from the previous R01, a set of technical developments is outlined to transform the array of information routinely collected from clinical as- sessment of ICA patients into a Bayesian belief network (BBN) that models the disease. First, we evolve the concept of a phenomenon-centric data model (PCDM) as the basis for (temporally) organizing clinically-derived observations, enabling the model to be associated with processing pipelines that can identify and transform targeted variables from the content of clinical data sources. Through these pipelines, specific values in free- text reports (radiology, surgery, pathology, discharge summaries) and imaging studies will be automatically extracted into a scientific-quality database. Second, the PCDM schema for ICAs is mapped to a Bayesian belief network: the linkage between the PCDM and BBN allows automatic updating of the network and its progressive refinement from a growing dataset. The BBN's topology will be determined by clinical experts and conditional probabilities computed from the extracted clinical data. A basic graphical user interface (GUI) will permit users to interact with the BBN, aiding in medical decision making tasks. The GUI will allow a clinician to pose questions from either a set of common clinical queries or to create new queries: loading a patient's medical record into this application will automatically populate BBN variables with extracted information (i.e., from the pipelines). Each technical component of this proposal will be evaluated in a laboratory setting. In addition, the BBN will be tested for its predictive capabilities and compared to other statistical models to assess its potential in guiding ICA treatment. This proposal leverages a clinical collaboration with the UCLA Division of Interventional Neuroradiology, a leader in ICA research and treatment. A combined dataset of 2,000 retrospective and prospective subjects will be used to create the ICA database and BBN. Data collection will encompass a comprehensive set of variables including clinical presentation, imaging assessment (morphology, hemodynamics), histopathology, gene expression, treatment, and outcomes. We will additionally leverage the NIH/NINDS Human Genetic DNA and Cell Line Repository for additional ICA-related data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding on routine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) neuro-imaging studies. The associated mortality rate and comorbidity resultant from ruptured ICAs are extreme: subarachnoid hemorrhage causes 50% of individuals to die within one month of rupture, and more than one third of survivors develop major neurological deficits. Hence, the focus of this re- search is the creation of a comprehensive research database for ICA patients, using the spectrum of data routinely acquired in the diagnosis and treatment of the problem; from this database, a new probabilistic model of ICAs will be created, providing new insights into the disease and its optimal treatment for a given individual.           PROGRAM NARRATIVE Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding on routine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) neuro-imaging studies.

"Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California Population-based biobanks are a critical resource for identifying disease mechanisms and developing screening tests for biomarkers associated with certain disorders. The California Department of Public Health has been banking newborn specimens statewide since 1982 (N~14 million) and maternal prenatal specimens for a portion of the state since 2000 (N~1 million), creating one of the largest, if not the largest single biological specimen banks with linked data in the world. With the fast pace of new knowledge in genetics and laboratory methods, the demand for specimens and data from researchers around the world now far surpasses the Department's ability to fill them. The goal of this infrastructure development project is to create an efficient, high throughput, low cost newborn screening and prenatal/maternal screening specimen biobank and linked data base that could be used by large numbers of researchers around the world for a wide range of studies through the following aims: (1) establishment of highly efficient protocols and procurement and integration of automated systems for pulling and processing specimens; (2) development of an integrated specimen tracking system into the Department's existing web-based Screening Information System; (3) development of a computerized system to track application requests for specimens and data; and (4) development of a linked screening program-vital records database that is organized into a life course, client based system. These aims will be accomplished through expansion of the Department's award-winning Screening Integration System to include web-based tracking of specimens and research requests, and use of an innovative machine-learning record matching application for high-performance linkages. After the 2 year grant period is completed, the California Research Ready Biospecimen Bank will be able to provide researchers with valuable biological specimens in a timely, cost-effective manner, thereby enabling a dramatic expansion of epidemiological research nationwide. The continuity of the system will be ensured by codifying human subjects-sensitive policies and procedures into Departmental regulations and by charging researchers modest fees for specimens, data and other research services.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of a research-ready pregnancy and newborn biobank in California This proposal funds infrastructure development to create a research-ready, efficient, high- throughput, and low-cost prenatal and newborn biobank in California.

"Three-Class ROC Analysis for Task-Based Medical Image Quality Assessment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Conventional ROC analysis has been widely accepted as a standard in the assessment of diagnostic techniques for binary diagnoses. Many medical diagnoses, however, involve multiple diagnostic alternatives. Examples are breast cancer diagnosis using mammography, where the diagnostic classes are normal, benign, or malignant tumor, and cardiac disease diagnosis using myocardial perfusion SPECT (MRS), where the classes are normal, reversible or fixed defect. To assess multi-class diagnostic techniques, multi-class ROC is required, but has remained an unsolved problem ever since the introduction of binary ROC analysis in the 1950s. Sparked by a practical challenge raised by MPS optimization, the candidate proposed a three- class ROC analysis method that extends and unifies the decision theoretic, linear discriminant analysis and probabilistic foundations of binary ROC in a three-class paradigm. She has conducted five preliminary studies on three-class ROC analysis: (1) deriving its decision model [He, Metz, et.al IEEE Trans Med Imag (TMI) vol. 25(5), 2006]; (2) investigating its decision theoretic foundation [He and Frey, TMI, vol. 25(8), 2006]; (3) exploring its linear discriminant analysis (LDA) foundation [He and Frey, TMI, in press, 2006]; (4) establishing its probabilistic foundation; and (5) comparing it with conventional three-class LDA and revealing the limitations of conventional three-class LDA. The candidate obtained a PhD in Biomedical Engineering in December 2005 and had intensive training on medical imaging. She increased her interest in medical image quality assessment during the development of three-class ROC analysis; her knowledge of the statistics and decision theory principals used in this research is self-taught. Further exploring new areas opened by three- class ROC analysis requires systematic understanding of the statistical principles in decision theory, statistical learning, and Bayesian modeling, etc. Thus, she requests a two-year mentored phase focusing on formal biostatistics training. The training phase will substantially enhance the candidate's career development as an interdisciplinary investigator and contribute to her independent research to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) to establish the theoretical foundations of three-class ROC analysis; (2) to develop general statistical methods for three-class ROC analysis; (3) to apply the three-class methodologies to task-based medical image quality assessment. The significance of the proposed work is two-fold. First, it provides a rigorous solution to an open theoretical problem and will open new areas of theoretical research in ROC analysis and medical decision making. Second, it enables applications of task-based assessment techniques for multi-class diagnosis. These techniques have the potential to fundamentally improve current imaging techniques for disease detection and characterization, and thus to enhance doctors' performance in disease diagnosis, which will broadly benefit public health.          n/a",Three-Class ROC Analysis for Task-Based Medical Image Quality Assessment,7480255,K99EB007620,"['Area', 'Benign', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Theory', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical assessment', 'Pilot Projects', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Solutions', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'career', 'improved', 'interest', 'programs', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'statistics']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K99,2008,89733,807432003,-0.02243799208461304
"Prevalence of FMRI Expansions in Movement Disorders Dr. Deborah Ann Hall is applying for a mentored patient-oriented research (K23) award in the area of movement disorders. This proposal describes a research and training program for the development of a clinician-investigator in neurology. The principal investigator, Dr. Hall, has completed neurology residency  raining and a movement disorders fellowship. She received a competitive clinical research fellowship from the American Academy of Neurology and is pursuing a Ph.D. in Clinical Science. The candidate's immediate goals are to continue research in the fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, by directly applying her newly acquired epidemiologic and biostatistics skills in the proposed project. Her long term goals are to study the genetic risk factors, neuroepidemiology, and treatment of ataxia, including sporadic ataxia. During the award period, Dr. Hall will be based in the Department of Neurology at the University of Colorado (UCDHSC). UCDHSC has an extensive track record for supporting and developing clinician-investigators. The Ph.D. in Clinical Sciences program at UCDHSC facilitates mentored multidisciplinary clinical research. The candidate will carry out her research with Professors Tim Byers MD (Epidemiology), Maureen Leehey MD (Neurology), Gary Zerbe PhD (Biostatistics), and Paul Hagerman MD PhD (Biological Chemistry). Dr. Hall's research program is to determine the prevalence of repeat expansions in the FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation) gene in subjects with tremor, ataxia, and/or parkinsonism. Dr. Hall will do a cross- sectional study by recruiting subjects in her clinics with the three phenotypes and performing PCR of the FMR1 gene. All subjects eligible will be recruited and the genetic testing will be done in a research laboratory. The primary outcomes to be measured are the prevalence of repeat expansions in the three groups combined and each phenotypic subgroup. The age of onset, age of diagnosis of neurological signs, and correlations between trinucleotide repeat size and phenotype are also outcomes to be measured. Linear and logistic regression models will be used and covariates including race and ethnicity will be studied. Relevance: This study is important because it may define genetic risk factors for various abnormal movements, such as tremor. This will result in improved diagnosis and potentially treatment of individuals with progressive neurological diseases. These illnesses represent an important public health problem as they cause morbidity and mortality in our aging population. n/a",Prevalence of FMRI Expansions in Movement Disorders,7413272,K23NS052487,"['Academy', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Area', 'Ataxia', 'Award', 'Biochemistry', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Colorado', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'FMR1', 'FMR1 Gene', 'FMR1 Premutation', 'FMR1 repeat expansion', 'FXTAS', 'Fellowship', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Gait abnormality', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intention Tremor', 'Laboratory Research', 'Length', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentored Clinical Oncology Award', 'Mentored Clinical Scientist Award', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurology', 'Outcome', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Rain', 'Range', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Residencies', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Subgroup', 'Training Programs', 'Tremor', 'Trinucleotide Repeats', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging population', 'base', 'disability', 'genetic risk factor', 'improved', 'male', 'men', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'professor', 'programs', 'size', 'skills']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K23,2008,173340,292134808,-0.009864608324836308
"AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 1 million people in the US will experience a heart attack or sudden cardiac death. A large percentage of these patients have no prior symptoms of any kind but suffer from silent heart disease (ischemia), which may cause a heart attack at any time. Currently there is no reliable screening method to identify people who may have silent heart disease and therefore are at risk of ""heart attack"".       We seek to extract additional data from a non-invasive Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the heart (commonly used in most imaging centers), which will better identify patients who are ""vulnerable"" to sudden heart attack. These images are acquired without contrast agents, as a common screening test for measuring coronary calcium, another clinical marker of coronary artery disease. We will prove that additional information about cardiovascular risk can be obtained by quantifying pericardial fat surrounding the heart in these cardiac CT images. Although this information exists in the cardiac CT scans acquired today, it is ignored in clinical practice because currently there are no tools to measure it automatically and reliably, and no information regarding its significance for a given patient.       We will develop fully automated, accurate, new computer software for quantitation of pericardial fat from cardiac CT images acquired for routine assessment of coronary calcium. We plan to achieve complete automation and accuracy, by applying a combination of robust and effective algorithms in machine learning with anatomical knowledge. We aim to prove that the developed automatic software will be as accurate, and more reproducible than experienced imaging physicians in quantifying pericardial fat, and will accomplish the measurement in a fraction of the time. Such software could be immediately made available worldwide to standard imaging workstations. For the first time, this will allow its use as a standard practical imaging tool for cardiovascular risk assessment, without requiring additional time, imaging or radiation risk to the patient.       We will also show that this new quantitative information has important additional value compared to other clinical cardiovascular risk factors and information from blood samples (such as cholesterol, glucose and CRP), and the amount of calcium in the patient's coronary arteries seen on CT scans, and establish its significance in the prediction of silent heart disease.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This new research will allow accurate prediction of who might be more likely to have heart disease which may ultimately cause a heart attack. It will allow doctors to identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed to avoid a heart attack, or more extensive testing, could be recommended, to confirm or rule out heart disease.          n/a",AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR,7470355,R21EB006829,"['Abdomen', 'Algorithms', 'Automation', 'Biochemical', 'Blood specimen', 'C-reactive protein', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Invasive', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patients', 'Pericardial body location', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Score', 'Screening procedure', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Today', 'Visceral', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cysteine rich protein', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'human FAT protein', 'indexing', 'novel', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool', 'waist circumference']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2008,245025,90419233,0.007846102314499144

"Developing computerized tools for cryosurgery planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Cryosurgery has been known as an invasive surgical technique since 1961, when Cooper and Lee invented the first cryoprobe. In the 1990s, new developments in Joule-Thomson cooling (the cooling effect associated with a sudden relief of a pressurized gas) led to a dramatic decrease in the size of cryoprobes and an increase in the number of cryoprobes that could be used simultaneously. A dozen or more cryoprobes operating simultaneously in a single prostate cryosurgery is already common practice. If localized effectively, one of the primary benefits of using a large number of miniaturized cryoprobes is superior control over the freezing process.   Currently, the process of selecting the correct placement of the cryoprobes for a specific procedure is an art held by the cryosurgeon, based on the surgeon's own experience and rules of thumb. Cryoprobes are typically operated in a trial-and-error fashion, until the entire target volume is thought to be frozen. Currently, there are no means to determine the optimal locations for the cryoprobes. Suboptimal cryoprobe localization may leave regions in the target volume unfrozen, may lead to cryoinjury of healthy surrounding tissues, may require an unnecessarily large number of cryoprobes, may increase the duration of the surgical procedure, and may increase the likelihood of post cryosurgery complications, all of which affect the quality and cost of the medical treatment. Computerized planning tools would help to alleviate these difficulties.   The ""cryoheater,"" a new device for cryosurgery control has recently been presented by the research team. The cryoheater is a temperature controlled electrical heater. In broad terms, cryoheaters can dramatically increase the ability to control the shape and size of the frozen region, however, to achieve the full benefits of cryoheaters, computerized planning tools for cryoheater localization are necessary.   Our goal is to develop computerized planning tools for cryosurgery that are suitable for all available cooling techniques. The proposed research includes: (1) Development of an efficient numerical scheme for bioheat transfer simulations of cyroprocedures, (2) Development of an efficient optimization technique based on a force-field analogy. (3) Development of knowledge-based optimization techniques. (4) Experimental verification of the planning tool.       Besides planning, another important application of the proposed tool is the training of cryosurgeons. The proposed tool will provide cryosurgeons with the ability to visualize the 3D volumetric nature of the freezing process.   Likewise, it will allow the surgeon to explore the performance of various configurations of cryoprobes and cryoheaters, and observe the defects that would result from each. Such visualization capabilities will provide surgeons with insights into the physics of cryosurgery that are difficult to obtain from physical experiments or surgical practice.         n/a",Developing computerized tools for cryosurgery planning,7210691,R01EB003563,"['Affect', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Catheters', 'Computational Technique', 'Condition', 'Cool-X-A', 'Cryosurgery', 'Defect', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Europe', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Furuncles', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Heating', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Device', 'Invasive', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Liquid substance', 'Localized', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modems', 'Nature', 'Nitrogen', 'Numbers', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physics', 'Placement', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Radio', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Scheme', 'Shapes', 'Simulate', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Surgeon', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Thermal Ablation Therapy', 'Thinking', 'Thumb structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urethra', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'experience', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'miniaturize', 'research study', 'simulation', 'size', 'thermal seeds', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIBIB,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,87443,30434536,-0.01562503399266318
"Three-Class ROC Analysis for Task-Based Medical Image Quality Assessment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Conventional ROC analysis has been widely accepted as a standard in the assessment of diagnostic techniques for binary diagnoses. Many medical diagnoses, however, involve multiple diagnostic alternatives. Examples are breast cancer diagnosis using mammography, where the diagnostic classes are normal, benign, or malignant tumor, and cardiac disease diagnosis using myocardial perfusion SPECT (MRS), where the classes are normal, reversible or fixed defect. To assess multi-class diagnostic techniques, multi-class ROC is required, but has remained an unsolved problem ever since the introduction of binary ROC analysis in the 1950s. Sparked by a practical challenge raised by MPS optimization, the candidate proposed a three- class ROC analysis method that extends and unifies the decision theoretic, linear discriminant analysis and probabilistic foundations of binary ROC in a three-class paradigm. She has conducted five preliminary studies on three-class ROC analysis: (1) deriving its decision model [He, Metz, et.al IEEE Trans Med Imag (TMI) vol. 25(5), 2006]; (2) investigating its decision theoretic foundation [He and Frey, TMI, vol. 25(8), 2006]; (3) exploring its linear discriminant analysis (LDA) foundation [He and Frey, TMI, in press, 2006]; (4) establishing its probabilistic foundation; and (5) comparing it with conventional three-class LDA and revealing the limitations of conventional three-class LDA. The candidate obtained a PhD in Biomedical Engineering in December 2005 and had intensive training on medical imaging. She increased her interest in medical image quality assessment during the development of three-class ROC analysis; her knowledge of the statistics and decision theory principals used in this research is self-taught. Further exploring new areas opened by three- class ROC analysis requires systematic understanding of the statistical principles in decision theory, statistical learning, and Bayesian modeling, etc. Thus, she requests a two-year mentored phase focusing on formal biostatistics training. The training phase will substantially enhance the candidate's career development as an interdisciplinary investigator and contribute to her independent research to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) to establish the theoretical foundations of three-class ROC analysis; (2) to develop general statistical methods for three-class ROC analysis; (3) to apply the three-class methodologies to task-based medical image quality assessment. The significance of the proposed work is two-fold. First, it provides a rigorous solution to an open theoretical problem and will open new areas of theoretical research in ROC analysis and medical decision making. Second, it enables applications of task-based assessment techniques for multi-class diagnosis. These techniques have the potential to fundamentally improve current imaging techniques for disease detection and characterization, and thus to enhance doctors' performance in disease diagnosis, which will broadly benefit public health.          n/a",Three-Class ROC Analysis for Task-Based Medical Image Quality Assessment,7298516,K99EB007620,"['Area', 'Benign', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Theory', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical assessment', 'Pilot Projects', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Solutions', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'career', 'improved', 'interest', 'programs', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'statistics']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K99,2007,88539,807432003,-0.02243799208461304
"Prevalence of FMRI Expansions in Movement Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Deborah Ann Hall is applying for a Pentored Patient-Oriented Research (K23) Award in the area of movement disorders. This proposal describes a research and training program for the development of a clinician-investigator in neurology. The principal investigator, Dr. Hall, has completed neurology residency training and a movement disorders fellowship. She received a competitive clinical research fellowship from the American Academy of Neurology and is pursuing a Ph.D. in Clinical Science. The candidate's immediate goals are to continue research in the fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, by directly applying her newly acquired epidemiologic and biostatistics skills in the proposed project. Her long term goals are to study the genetic risk factors, neuroepidemiology and treatment of ataxia, including sporadic ataxia. During the award period, Dr. Hall will be based in the Department of Neurology at the University of Colorado (UCDHSC).

"Computational Modeling of Anatomical Shape Distributions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Segmentation of detailed, patient-specific models from medical imagery can provide invaluable assistance for surgical planning and navigation. Current segmentation methods often make errors when confronted with subtle intensity boundaries. Adding knowledge of expected shape of a structure, and the range of normal variations in shape, can greatly improve segmentation, by guiding it towards the most likely shape consistent with the image information. The resulting segmentations can be used to plan surgical procedures, and when registered to the patient, can provide navigational guidance around critical structures. Many neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, and Fetal Growth Restriction, affect the shape of specific anatomical areas. To understand the development and progression of these diseases, as well as to develop methods for classifying instances into diseased or normal classes, 1 needs methods that capture differences in shape distributions between populations. Our goal is to develop and validate methods for learning from images concise representations of anatomical shape and its variability, Modeling shape distributions will improve segmentation algorithms by biasing the search towards more likely shapes. It will also enable quantitative analysis based on shape in population studies, where imaging is used to study differences in anatomy between populations, as well as changes within a population, for example with age. The proposed research builds on prior methods for segmentation and shape analysis, using tools from computer vision and machine learning applied to questions of shape representation, shape based segmentation and shape analysis for population studies. We plan to further develop the methods and to validate them with our collaborators in several different applications, including surgical planning, neonatal imaging and image-based studies of aging and Alzheimer's disease.            n/a",Computational Modeling of Anatomical Shape Distributions,7186695,R01NS051826,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomic structures', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Back', 'Biomechanics', 'Boston', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical assessments', 'Clutterings', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse Pattern', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'General Hospitals', 'Genetic Markers', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Device', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Invasive', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Link', 'Localized', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Neonatal', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Noise', 'Normal Range', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Premature Infant', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psyche structure', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Statistical Models', 'Statistical Study', 'Statistically Significant', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Instruments', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tweens', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Woman', 'base', 'cohort', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'desire', 'deviant', 'disease classification', 'expectation', 'feeding', 'healthy aging', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'mortality', 'neonate', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neurosurgery', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'programs', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'shape analysis', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tumor']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2007,282619,113554200,0.004387792496826824

"Computer-Aided Interpretation of Oculometric Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed research program is to develop computer software tools with embedded artificial intelligence (AI) that can perform instantaneous, automated analysis and clinical interpretation of wavefront error measurements of the human eye and cornea. Secondary goals are to improve the overall design of oculometric data visualization tools, provide information that will help to establish clinical and scientific standards for ocular measurements and procedures, and improve our understanding of the fundamental relationship between optical performance and visual performance. We hypothesize that a) AI-based algorithms will detect complex patterns of wavefront errors; b) these patterns are specific to and significantly correlated with certain diseases and disorders; and c) AI-based interpretation of complex data will be superior to that performed by expert humans, who are the gold standard for interpreting clinical data. Specifically, we will (1) develop, train, and test AI-based algorithms (Bayesian and neural networks) to interpret the significance of complex wavefront error data obtained retrospectively from examination records of patients with various ocular diseases, disorders, or surgical interventions, as well as normal eyes; (2) simulate wavefront error data using computer models based on statistical distributions of actual ocular aberrations from patient population samples for the purpose of investigating the importance of individual higher order aberrations to retinal image formation and potential visual performance, as well as to generate new data that will enhance the overall AI training and testing process, and (3) establish standard methods to acquire and analyze wavefront error data. AI-based tools will assist vision scientists to efficiently develop study databases and analyze aberration data. Clinicians will diagnose patients faster, more accurately, and with a greater degree of confidence. For patients, refractive surgery outcomes will be more predictable, and they will benefit from earlier detection of diseases such as cataracts and corneal ectasias.         n/a",Computer-Aided Interpretation of Oculometric Data,7287568,R01EY014162,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'eye disorder diagnosis', 'eye refractometry', 'human data', 'image processing', 'ophthalmoscopy']",NEI,LOUISIANA STATE UNIV HSC NEW ORLEANS,R01,2006,38558,0,-0.027660814346233784
"Detection of chewing and swallowing to estimate eating patterns and energy intake DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The prevalence of obesity in developed countries is increasing at an alarming rate. Obesity contributes to an increased risk of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and some cancers and is now considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The objective of this research is to investigate application of novel noninvasive devices and pattern recognition methods to perform studies of human food intake behavior and produce objective estimates of volumetric and caloric food intake that will be relevant for identifying effective measures to treat or prevent diseases like obesity. Such devices and methods could extend our understanding of causes of obesity, and the monitoring devices created in this study could be used for monitoring of obese patients and as a part of a therapy potentially improve quality of life and decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with obesity. The goal of this study is to design and perform a pilot investigation which will provide preliminary data that objective observations of mastication (chewing) and deglutition (swallowing) by a wearable, non-intrusive monitoring device can provide statistically reliable estimates of eating habits by providing objective measures of delution frequency, duration of mastication and identifying periods of food intake with sufficient sensitivity and specificity.  The aims of the proposed research include design of the wearable sensors and associated signal processing methods; development of pattern recognition methodologies that will automatically detect instances of delution and mastication from sensor recordings; development of pattern recognition methods to automatically identify periods of food intake based on detected chewing and swallowing; and to validate these device and methodologies on a group of human subjects.

The primary outcomes to be measured are the prevalence of repeat expansions in the three groups combined and each phenotypic subgroup. The age of onset, age of diagnosis of neurological signs and correlations between tri-nucleotide repeat size and phenotype are also outcomes to be measured. Linear and logistic regression models will be used and covariates including race and ethnicity will be studied. Relevance: This study is important because it may define genetic risk factors for various abnormal movements, such as tremor. This will result in improved diagnosis and potentially treatment of individuals with progressive neurological diseases. These illnesses represent an important public health problem as they cause morbidity and mortality in our aging population.     n/a",Prevalence of FMRI Expansions in Movement Disorders,7103035,K23NS052487,"['aging', 'ataxia', 'cerebellar ataxia /dyskinesia', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis', 'genes', 'genetics', 'phenotype', 'tremor']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K23,2006,187920,292134808,-0.01016453889345054
"Multi-microphone long probe for OAE acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of an innovative multi-microphone probe and acquisition system for recording otoacoustic emissions {OAEs} with advanced noise cancellation algorithms, increased frequency and intensity ranges and pressurization capabilities is proposed. Two advanced noise cancellation algorithm will be implemented: 1) a multi-reference adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) network and 2) two-dimensional filtering. These algorithms will utilize the independent measurements provided by the multiple microphones in order to reduce noise contaminants. Each microphone or microphone groupings will be connected to individual analog-to-digital (A/D) converters in order to allow for the implementation of the digital signal processing algorithms. The pressurization capabilities of the probe will allow implementation of tympanometry and the acquisition of OAEs while compensating for pressure imbalances between the outer and middle ear. Results from a prototype single microphone long probe are presented demonstrating that the design concept is valid and provides good quality OAE recordings while reducing the undesirable effects of the metal response. The proposed probe will also improve upon the limited dynamic and frequency range of current OAE probes. The probe is expected to be able to provide stimulus levels of up to 90 dB HL and a frequency response of up to 24 kHz. During Phase I, various probes will be constructed and tested under different noise conditions in adult and infant subjects. During Phase II, the pressurization capabilities of the new probe will be further developed and examined. The optimal probe designed will be implemented along with the optimal noise cancellation algorithm and tested in a comprehensive clinical study incorporating the pressurization capabilities of the probe. n/a",Multi-microphone long probe for OAE acquisition,6933674,R43DC007543,"['adult human (21+)', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical equipment development', 'clinical biomedical equipment', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'ear disorder diagnosis', 'infant human (0-1 year)', 'mathematics', 'noise', 'otoacoustic emission', 'sound frequency']",NIDCD,INTELLIGENT HEARING SYSTEMS,R43,2005,100000,618360,-0.007313516226614883
"Perception and Inter-Observer Variability in Mammography DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Inter-observer variability in mammogram reading has been well documented in the literature. Various factors have been used to explain this variability; among them, the most significant are related to the management of perceived findings.  However, the nature of this inter-observer variability has not been explored. Namely, were the lesions that were consistently reported by the radiologists any different from the ones that yield disagreement? Furthermore, could these differences be quantitatively assessed? Moreover, were these differences in any way related with the experience level of the observer? In addition, the interpretation of perceived findings is closely related with the visual search strategy used to scan the breast tissue, because observers compare perceived findings with the background, in order to determine their uniqueness. Hence, what is the effect of visual search strategy on inter-observer variability? Can this effect be modeled using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)? Can inferences be made regarding the observers' decision patterns by analyzing the results of simulations run on the ANNs?  The work described here aims at answering these questions. We will use spatial frequency analysis to characterize the areas on mammogram cases where mammographers, chest radiologists with experience reading mammograms and radiology residents at the end of their mammography rotation, indicate the presence of a finding, or fail to do so. We will assess inter-observer agreement, as well as intra- and inter-group agreement for the various groups of observers. In addition, we will train artificial neural networks to represent each observer, in such a way that by changing the nature of the features input to the ANNs we will be able to simulate how such changes would have affected the actual observer. We will assess the effects on inter-observer variability of changing the search strategy used by the observer to sample the breast tissue. In our setting, the inter-observer variability will be assessed by comparing the outputs of the ANNs that represent each observer. In addition, the changes in sampling strategy will correspond to actual possible strategies for the human observers themselves. n/a",Perception and Inter-Observer Variability in Mammography,6924688,R21CA100107,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'breast neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'human data', 'human therapy evaluation', 'mammography', 'visual perception']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2005,167063,570146095,-0.04356538496534788
"Detection of chewing and swallowing to estimate eating patterns and energy intake DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The prevalence of obesity in developed countries is increasing at an alarming rate. Obesity contributes to an increased risk of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and some cancers and is now considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The objective of this research is to investigate application of novel noninvasive devices and pattern recognition methods to perform studies of human food intake behavior and produce objective estimates of volumetric and caloric food intake that will be relevant for identifying effective measures to treat or prevent diseases like obesity. Such devices and methods could extend our understanding of causes of obesity, and the monitoring devices created in this study could be used for monitoring of obese patients and as a part of a therapy potentially improve quality of life and decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with obesity. The goal of this study is to design and perform a pilot investigation which will provide preliminary data that objective observations of mastication (chewing) and deglutition (swallowing) by a wearable, non-intrusive monitoring device can provide statistically reliable estimates of eating habits by providing objective measures of delution frequency, duration of mastication and identifying periods of food intake with sufficient sensitivity and specificity.  The aims of the proposed research include design of the wearable sensors and associated signal processing methods; development of pattern recognition methodologies that will automatically detect instances of delution and mastication from sensor recordings; development of pattern recognition methods to automatically identify periods of food intake based on detected chewing and swallowing; and to validate these device and methodologies on a group of human subjects. Modern methods of computational intelligence such as artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic will be used along with statistical methods to achieve the highest 'accuracy of pattern recognition. n/a",Detection of chewing and swallowing to estimate eating patterns and energy intake,7022662,R21HL083052,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavior test', 'bioenergetics', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical automation', 'biomedical equipment development', 'biosensor device', 'biotechnology', 'caloric dietary content', 'calorimetry', 'clinical biomedical equipment', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'disease /disorder prevention /control', 'human morbidity', 'human subject', 'mastication', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'nutrient intake activity', 'nutrition related tag', 'obesity', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'quality of life', 'statistics /biometry', 'swallowing']",NHLBI,CLARKSON UNIVERSITY,R21,2005,217756,0,-0.0024390899093276156
"Computer-Aided Interpretation of Oculometric Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed research program is to develop computer software tools with embedded artificial intelligence (AI) that can perform instantaneous, automated analysis and clinical interpretation of wavefront error measurements of the human eye and cornea. Secondary goals are to improve the overall design of oculometric data visualization tools, provide information that will help to establish clinical and scientific standards for ocular measurements and procedures, and improve our understanding of the fundamental relationship between optical performance and visual performance. We hypothesize that a) AI-based algorithms will detect complex patterns of wavefront errors; b) these patterns are specific to and significantly correlated with certain diseases and disorders; and c) AI-based interpretation of complex data will be superior to that performed by expert humans, who are the gold standard for interpreting clinical data. Specifically, we will (1) develop, train, and test AI-based algorithms (Bayesian and neural networks) to interpret the significance of complex wavefront error data obtained retrospectively from examination records of patients with various ocular diseases, disorders, or surgical interventions, as well as normal eyes; (2) simulate wavefront error data using computer models based on statistical distributions of actual ocular aberrations from patient population samples for the purpose of investigating the importance of individual higher order aberrations to retinal image formation and potential visual performance, as well as to generate new data that will enhance the overall AI training and testing process, and (3) establish standard methods to acquire and analyze wavefront error data. AI-based tools will assist vision scientists to efficiently develop study databases and analyze aberration data.

"Automated Plaque Detection and Classification using MRI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Acute thrombus formation on disrupted/eroded human atherosclerotic lesions plays a critical role on the onset of acute coronary syndromes and progression of atherosclerosis. Pathological evidence has clearly established that it is plaque composition rather than stenotic severity that modulates plaque vulnerability and thrombogenicity. Therefore, the possibility of detecting and characterizing atherosclerotic lesions would have significant clinical implications. Among the different imaging modalities, MRI seems to be the most promising in terms of discrimination and due to its non-invasive nature. We propose to develop an automated MRI image analysis system for detecting, measuring, and classifying atherosclerotic plaques. The proposed project will be conducted by a highly experienced team of experts in signal processing, pattern recognition, statistics, and product development in close collaboration with key cardiovascular researchers, with specific expertise in MRI imaging and atherosclerosis. Automation would establish a fast, objective (observer-independent), and standard diagnostic measure of plaque burden, allowing for comparison of results between laboratories, throughout longitudinal studies, and across different imaging equipment. In a clinical setting, this system would greatly reduce the diagnostic costs involved in measuring the degree of stenosis and detecting thrombosis-prone plaques. n/a",Automated Plaque Detection and Classification using MRI,6951380,R44HL071470,"['artificial intelligence', 'atherosclerotic plaque', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical automation', 'cardiovascular disorder diagnosis', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'human data', 'image processing', 'informatics', 'magnetic resonance imaging']",NHLBI,ISCHEM CORPORATION,R44,2005,374972,0,-0.015912138428897007
"Automated (AI) Analysis of Sleep Disordered Breathing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) This training grant is designed to advance the academic career of Dr. Indu Ayappa by building on the applicant?s strong biomedical engineering and computer background and providing comprehensive multi-disciplinary training which will allow her to become an independent investigator. The applicant?s career goals are to enter full time academic research in sleep physiology. Training activities proposed will include academic course work designed to support the research program and expose her to aspects of clinical research in sleep, neural science and artificial intelligence techniques. She will be mentored by David Rapoport, M.D., Joyce Walsleben, Ph.D., and Maurice Ohayon, M.D., Ph.D., as well as faculty in computer science and neurophysiology. The aims of the planned research are to develop an artificial intelligence system for the identification and quantification of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) based solely on non-invasive cardiopulmonary signals collected during routine polysomnography. This will simplify, standardize and improve the diagnosis of SDB and facilitate research in this area. With the long term goal of physiologic characterization of the spectrum of SDB in order to clinically diagnose upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS), the aims of this project are to: 1. Extract features from the nasal cannula airflow signal to characterize the state of resistance/collapsibility of individual breaths. These include amplitude, inspiratory flow contour, Ti/Ttot and presence of vibration which will be used as inputs to a neural network that will be trained and evaluated against breaths that have been classified by reference measurement of upper airway resistance (pressure/flow). 2A. Incorporate information from this classification of individual breaths to detect and classify respiratory events based on the flow signal alone using a trained neural network. 2B. Evaluate the utility of including additional cardiopulmonary signals like oxygen saturation, heart rate, pulse transit time and rib/abdominal movements (amplitude and phase) in the detection and classification of these events.

"Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) The identification of electrographic            seizures during long-term EEG monitoring in the neonate is currently based upon      visual interpretation of the graphic record, a process that is very                  time-consuming. While significant progress has been made in the automated            detection of seizures in the adult population, relatively little work has been       done in the neonatal area. Therefore, the major objective of this project is         the development of techniques for the reliable automated detection of                electrographic seizures in the neonatal EEG. We propose a multi-stage, hybrid        approach to detection that will employ a combination of signal processing,           pattern recognition, neural networks, and expert rules. Through the successive       stages of the detection process, multichannel neonatal EEG data containing all       types of background activity and artifacts will be analyzed to detect and            classify electrographic seizures. We postulate that the varied types and             morphologies of seizures in the neonatal EEG, as compared to seizures in the         adult EEG, can best be detected and classified using this hybrid approach. We        will test the methods we develop on data recorded from infants in the Clinical       Research Center for Neonatal Seizures, The Methodist Hospital, in Houston,           Texas. We expect that the information we gain from the research will lead to         the development of a practical seizure detection system and further our              long-term goals of reduced expense in the reading and interpretation of              neonatal EEGs, and also facilitate the efficient collection of seizure               parameters for possible use in future research studies.                                                                                                                   n/a",Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG,6780874,R01NS040577,"['adult human (21+)', 'age difference', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical equipment development', 'brain electrical activity', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'electroencephalography', 'epilepsy', 'human subject', 'newborn human (0-6 weeks)', 'patient monitoring device', 'patient oriented research']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2004,194888,31980265,-0.013200364442030385

"FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH DRY EYE IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN DESCRIPTION: (Candidate's Abstract) The specific aims of this proposal are as follows: to train Dr. Nichols in the areas of visual epidemiology and biostatistics, to evaluate the systemic and environmental factors associated with dry eye in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, and to investigate the relations among dry eye diagnostic tests in this cohort. We plan to utilize the Observational Study (OS) cohort of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) at The Ohio State University. Approval for this WHI ancillary study has been obtained from the WHI Executive Committee and the WHI Design and Analysis Committee. In an effort to increase statistical power, a dry eye screening survey will be used to enrich the dry eye cases in this cross-section study design (sometimes called a prevalent case-control study). Following the dry eye screening survey, a dry eye examination will be performed on approximately 750 WHI Observational study participants (350 symptomatic patients, and 400 asymptomatic patients frequency matched by age). The definition of dry eye we will use includes the presence of symptoms of ocular irritation and one of three abnormal dry eye diagnostic tests: tear break-up time, fluorescein staining of the cornea, and measurement of tear meniscus height. Logistic regression will be used to assess the factors associated with a dry eye diagnosis using baseline and year3 follow-up data from the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study cohort. Sensitivity and specificity and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses will be performed to evaluate the relations between the additional diagnostic tests performed in the dry eye examination (osmolality, lactoferrin concentration, phenol red thread test, and lissamine green conjunctival staining) and our proposed definition of dry eye. The training plan and the research plan are closely related in this proposal.

"Automated (AI) Analysis of Sleep Disordered Breathing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) This training grant is designed to advance the academic career of Dr. Indu Ayappa by building on the applicant?s strong biomedical engineering and computer background and providing comprehensive multi-disciplinary training which will allow her to become an independent investigator. The applicant?s career goals are to enter full time academic research in sleep physiology. Training activities proposed will include academic course work designed to support the research program and expose her to aspects of clinical research in sleep, neural science and artificial intelligence techniques. She will be mentored by David Rapoport, M.D., Joyce Walsleben, Ph.D., and Maurice Ohayon, M.D., Ph.D., as well as faculty in computer science and neurophysiology. The aims of the planned research are to develop an artificial intelligence system for the identification and quantification of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) based solely on non-invasive cardiopulmonary signals collected during routine polysomnography. This will simplify, standardize and improve the diagnosis of SDB and facilitate research in this area. With the long term goal of physiologic characterization of the spectrum of SDB in order to clinically diagnose upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS), the aims of this project are to: 1. Extract features from the nasal cannula airflow signal to characterize the state of resistance/collapsibility of individual breaths. These include amplitude, inspiratory flow contour, Ti/Ttot and presence of vibration which will be used as inputs to a neural network that will be trained and evaluated against breaths that have been classified by reference measurement of upper airway resistance (pressure/flow). 2A. Incorporate information from this classification of individual breaths to detect and classify respiratory events based on the flow signal alone using a trained neural network. 2B. Evaluate the utility of including additional cardiopulmonary signals like oxygen saturation, heart rate, pulse transit time and rib/abdominal movements (amplitude and phase) in the detection and classification of these events.

"Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) The identification of electrographic            seizures during long-term EEG monitoring in the neonate is currently based upon      visual interpretation of the graphic record, a process that is very                  time-consuming. While significant progress has been made in the automated            detection of seizures in the adult population, relatively little work has been       done in the neonatal area. Therefore, the major objective of this project is         the development of techniques for the reliable automated detection of                electrographic seizures in the neonatal EEG. We propose a multi-stage, hybrid        approach to detection that will employ a combination of signal processing,           pattern recognition, neural networks, and expert rules. Through the successive       stages of the detection process, multichannel neonatal EEG data containing all       types of background activity and artifacts will be analyzed to detect and            classify electrographic seizures. We postulate that the varied types and             morphologies of seizures in the neonatal EEG, as compared to seizures in the         adult EEG, can best be detected and classified using this hybrid approach. We        will test the methods we develop on data recorded from infants in the Clinical       Research Center for Neonatal Seizures, The Methodist Hospital, in Houston,           Texas. We expect that the information we gain from the research will lead to         the development of a practical seizure detection system and further our              long-term goals of reduced expense in the reading and interpretation of              neonatal EEGs, and also facilitate the efficient collection of seizure               parameters for possible use in future research studies.                                                                                                                   n/a",Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG,6642804,R01NS040577,"['adult human (21+)', ' age difference', ' artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' biomedical equipment development', ' brain electrical activity', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' electroencephalography', ' epilepsy', ' human subject', ' newborn human (0-6 weeks)', ' patient monitoring device', ' patient oriented research']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2003,193637,31980265,-0.013200364442030385
"Computer-Aided Interpretation of Oculometric Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed research program is to develop computer software tools with embedded artificial intelligence (AI) that can perform instantaneous, automated analysis and clinical interpretation of wavefront error measurements of the human eye and cornea. Secondary goals are to improve the overall design of oculometric data visualization tools, provide information that will help to establish clinical and scientific standards for ocular measurements and procedures, and improve our understanding of the fundamental relationship between optical performance and visual performance. We hypothesize that a) AI-based algorithms will detect complex patterns of wavefront errors; b) these patterns are specific to and significantly correlated with certain diseases and disorders; and c) AI-based interpretation of complex data will be superior to that performed by expert humans, who are the gold standard for interpreting clinical data. Specifically, we will (1) develop, train, and test AI-based algorithms (Bayesian and neural networks) to interpret the significance of complex wavefront error data obtained retrospectively from examination records of patients with various ocular diseases, disorders, or surgical interventions, as well as normal eyes; (2) simulate wavefront error data using computer models based on statistical distributions of actual ocular aberrations from patient population samples for the purpose of investigating the importance of individual higher order aberrations to retinal image formation and potential visual performance, as well as to generate new data that will enhance the overall AI training and testing process, and (3) establish standard methods to acquire and analyze wavefront error data. AI-based tools will assist vision scientists to efficiently develop study databases and analyze aberration data. Clinicians will diagnose patients faster, more accurately, and with a greater degree of confidence. For patients, refractive surgery outcomes will be more predictable, and they will benefit from earlier detection of diseases such as cataracts and corneal ectasias.         n/a",Computer-Aided Interpretation of Oculometric Data,6617187,R01EY014162,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' eye disorder diagnosis', ' eye refractometry', ' human data', ' image processing', ' ophthalmoscopy']",NEI,LOUISIANA STATE UNIV HSC NEW ORLEANS,R01,2003,241570,0,-0.027660814346233784
"Automated Quantitation of 3D Echocardiograms In Phase I we developed a method for automated border detection (ABD) of echocardiographic scans that is feasible for clinical application. The accuracy of our processes provides exceeds Phase I goals and is comparable to interobserver variability in measuring volume and ejection fraction, and in border location. For a diverse set of patients, we have achieved an accuracy of 10 ml for endocardial volume, 4% for ejection fraction, and ,2.0 mm for border position. Our processes operates in 4 min. In Phase II we propose to continue research and development to move our ABD technology closer to clinical user. Our first specific aim is to reduce the amount of manual input required even further. Our second aim is to develop a prototype system suitable for clinical evaluation. Our third aim is to perform a pilot trial to evaluate the performance of our ABD process, as a preparation for a more formal, multi-center clinical trial planned for Phase III.

"Sub-millimeter Simultaneous SPECT-CT for Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    We are proposing to develop a single, bench-top animal scanner that will acquire both functional SPECT images and anatomical CT images with sub-millimeter spatial resolution for both imaging modalities. The sub-mm SPECT-CT will provide a technique for noninvasive functional imaging in mice for a wide range of applications, including the development of new radio-pharmaceuticals, assessment of new therapeutic approaches, and investigation of fundamental biological processes in transgenic and knockout mice. This would allow investigators to perform serial imaging studies in the same animal at multiple time points to investigate tumor growth, tissue pathology, the effects of therapy, and the mechanism of action of new diagnostic agents. The system will have wide applicability and significant impact in research that uses small animals to advance our understanding of human disease processes. During phase I we successfully completed all proposed feasibility studies to demonstrate SPECT/CT with gamma performance of 1.3mm intrinsic spatial resolution, E range from 30keV to 350keV, and,deltaE/E=12% at 140keV and - 100mu m CT capability from a 50xS0mm CMOS based digital x-ray detector.

"Optical Detection of Intravenous Infiltration  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): About 80% of hospital patients in the United States require IV therapy and 50% of IV lines fail due to infiltration, a clot in the cannula, an inflammatory response of the vein, or separation of the cannula from the vein. IV infiltration is usually accompanied by pain, erythema, and swelling at the cannula tip or the insertion site. Severe infiltration may lead to necrosis requiring skin debridement, skin grafting, or amputation. Early detection of infiltration prevents the occurrence of serious incidents that may require surgical correction. The long-term objective of this project is to develop an infiltration sensor for monitoring IV failures. The Phase II research design includes the development of an advanced prototype, improvement of algorithms, evaluation of the prototype on animal models and human measurements, investigation of its accuracy and utility, and the examination of the commercial potential.

"Development of Ultrasonic Appratus for Dental Diagnosis DESCRIPTION: An ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus has been proposed for Dental applications in determining tooth pathologies such as demineralization/caries, hidden fractures, and formation of abscesses. The equipment adopts a piezoelectric and laser optic hybrid transduction system for interrogation of teeth. Ultrasonic responses of the tooth structure will be analyzed by a pattern recognition expert system (artificial intelligence) to determine the diagnosis of the tooth inspected. The proposed research will eventually help to reduce the use of harmful X-ray radiation in Dental clinics and contribute to artificial intelligence based diagnosis. The proposed concept has been successfully demonstrated in the previous Phase I study. In this Phase II study, instrumentation for clinical data collection using a combination of conventional piezoelectric and new laser-based ultrasonic technologies will be developed and optimized; an artificial intelligence based diagnostic function will be developed using clinical data and implemented using embedded computing; numerical simulations will be used to enhance diagnostic function development; and finally, initial clinical trials will be conducted to demonstrate the performance of the prototype equipment.

"FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH DRY EYE IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN DESCRIPTION: (Candidate's Abstract) The specific aims of this proposal are as follows: to train Dr. Nichols in the areas of visual epidemiology and biostatistics, to evaluate the systemic and environmental factors associated with dry eye in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, and to investigate the relations among dry eye diagnostic tests in this cohort. We plan to utilize the Observational Study (OS) cohort of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) at The Ohio State University. Approval for this WHI ancillary study has been obtained from the WHI Executive Committee and the WHI Design and Analysis Committee. In an effort to increase statistical power, a dry eye screening survey will be used to enrich the dry eye cases in this cross-section study design (sometimes called a prevalent case-control study). Following the dry eye screening survey, a dry eye examination will be performed on approximately 750 WHI Observational study participants (350 symptomatic patients, and 400 asymptomatic patients frequency matched by age). The definition of dry eye we will use includes the presence of symptoms of ocular irritation and one of three abnormal dry eye diagnostic tests: tear break-up time, fluorescein staining of the cornea, and measurement of tear meniscus height. Logistic regression will be used to assess the factors associated with a dry eye diagnosis using baseline and year3 follow-up data from the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study cohort. Sensitivity and specificity and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses will be performed to evaluate the relations between the additional diagnostic tests performed in the dry eye examination (osmolality, lactoferrin concentration, phenol red thread test, and lissamine green conjunctival staining) and our proposed definition of dry eye. The training plan and the research plan are closely related in this proposal. The research plan will produce a data set of adequate scope and size to allow Dr. Nichols to apply the epidemiologic and biostatistical theory learned in the classroom. Throughout the course of the training plan, Dr. Nichols will complete the Ph.D. program in Vision Science/Physiological Optics and the Master's in Public Health program with an emphasis in epidemiology and biostatistics at The Ohio State University.

"Deployment Framework for Medical Imaging Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are many reasons for the relatively slow proliferation of advanced medical image processing methods but a significant reason is the present paradigm for providing access: most applications are still tied to proprietary software and hardware environments that carry significant up-front costs. The ultimate intent of this work is leverage commodity computing technologies to develop an open, extensible framework for deploying medical image processing applications in the heterogeneous, networked computing environment of today. The framework will provide clinicians and researchers access to state-of-the-art image processing applications regardless of their particular computing platform or locally available computing resources connecting them with federated database resources, with high-end computing resources, or even with their colleagues in a peer-to-peer computing environment. The aims for Phase I of this project are: (1) Demonstrate that the framework provides access to image processing applications to an extent that is largely independent of local computing resources. (2) Demonstrate that the framework is general in that the same components can be reused for deploying a wide variety of medical imaging applications. (3) Demonstrate that the framework is customizable both by third-party developers and by end-users allowing power-users to both create and deploy new applications. Work in Phase II will extend the framework and develop two-demonstration applications--computer aided diagnosis (CAD) for mammography and multimodality image fusion. The ultimate goal is to obtain key partnerships and the private equity investment necessary for commercialization, which will proceed by launching revenue-generating versions of the CAD and image fusion applications. n/a",Deployment Framework for Medical Imaging Applications,6494576,R44EB000149,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' clinical research', ' computed axial tomography', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer human interaction', ' computer network', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' human data', ' image processing', ' mammography', ' mathematics', ' positron emission tomography', ' telemedicine']",NIBIB,"FRONTIER MEDICAL, LLC",R44,2002,143577,0,-0.023003603667451418

"Development of Ultrasonic Apparatus for Dental Diagnosis   DESCRIPTION: Ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus has been proposed (Phases 1 and 2)      for Dental applications in determining tooth pathologies such as                     demineralization, caries, fractures, abscesses, and tooth wear. The equipment        adopts piezoelectric and optic hybrid transduction system for interrogation on       teeth. Ultrasonic responses of the tooth structure will then be analyzed by a        pattern recognition expert system (artificial intelligence) to determine the         diagnosis of the tooth inspected. The proposed research will eventually help to      reduce the use of harmful X-ray radiation in Dental clinic and also contribute       to artificial intelligence based diagnosis. In the Phase 1 research, tooth           specimens will be collected from local Dental clinics; demonstration                 instrumentation will be constructed; ultrasonic testing will be conducted on         the tooth specimens in vitro; and finally, the test data will be analyzed to         show the potential for Dental pathology identification. The feasibility of the       proposed research concept will be demonstrated, if: 1) meaningful ultrasonic         tests can be conducted using the simple piezo-/opto-ultrasonic system on the         tooth specimens collected; 2) various Dental pathologies in the tooth specimens      may be characterized by using wave pattern of the ultrasonic responses; and 3)       by identifying particular features of an ultrasonic wave pattern, the actual         tooth pathology may be recognized.

"Shearography for Non-Invasive Dental Health Evaluation   DESCRIPTION: Optical holography has been applied to non-invasive clinical            diagnosis and monitoring of Dental and oral/facial pathology, but has been           sharply limited in its usefulness by its requirements of high laser coherence.       absolute stability of setup. and wet processing of holograms. Physical Optics        Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a shearographic micro-optic camera as a        novel means of non-invasive Dental evaluation and characterization based on          shearing speckle interferometry, miniature camera imaging, and proprietary           neural network image processing. The innovation in this concept is the use of        shearography to avoid the need for high stability, high temporal coherence, and      wet processing. Nearfield shearography will have high spatial resolution, and        the neural network will perform real-time data processing and display.                                                                                                    The unique high resolution. real-time operation. low cost. and miniaturization       will make this device attractive to a large commercial market in Dental and          clinical applications.                                                                                                                                                    In Phase 1. POC will develop a miniature shearographic micro-optic camera            (SMOC) with fiber light delivery. a micro-CCD imaging component. and neural          network. It will be capable of distinguishing among tooth enamel, cementum,           dentine, pulp, and soft tissue.

"Educational Tools for Neuroscience   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SHAI proposes to bring two instructional        technologies together to compliment neuroscience lectures and distance               learning. Specifically we want to embed Computer Simulations of experiments and      the chemical, genetic, and physiological systems that underlie them within an        Intelligent Tutoring System. Simulations are excellent tools for revealing the       structure and dynamics of systems to students. They can also serve as a basis        of interactive experiments where students can ""discover"" the answers to              questions. Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) are an emerging educational            technology based on artificial intelligence research. They play the role of          tutor, in that they guide students with appropriate information or                   demonstrations when they are having difficulty with a lesson. They also              adaptively plan the presentation of new lessons based on evaluations of a            student's past performance and knowledge level. The objective of this phase I        proposal is to develop a prototype of NeuroTutor, a simulation-based ITS to          provide students with individualized instruction in a simulation centered            environment. Steps to reaching this objective include designing a curriculum,        developing instructional, presentations and support, developing appropriate          methods for Student Modeling and Diagnosis, and implementing a limited               prototype.

"FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH DRY EYE IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN DESCRIPTION: (Candidate's Abstract) The specific aims of this proposal are as follows: to train Dr. Nichols in the areas of visual epidemiology and biostatistics, to evaluate the systemic and environmental factors associated with dry eye in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, and to investigate the relations among dry eye diagnostic tests in this cohort. We plan to utilize the Observational Study (OS) cohort of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) at The Ohio State University. Approval for this WHI ancillary study has been obtained from the WHI Executive Committee and the WHI Design and Analysis Committee. In an effort to increase statistical power, a dry eye screening survey will be used to enrich the dry eye cases in this cross-section study design (sometimes called a prevalent case-control study). Following the dry eye screening survey, a dry eye examination will be performed on approximately 750 WHI Observational study participants (350 symptomatic patients, and 400 asymptomatic patients frequency matched by age). The definition of dry eye we will use includes the presence of symptoms of ocular irritation and one of three abnormal dry eye diagnostic tests: tear break-up time, fluorescein staining of the cornea, and measurement of tear meniscus height. Logistic regression will be used to assess the factors associated with a dry eye diagnosis using baseline and year3 follow-up data from the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study cohort. Sensitivity and specificity and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses will be performed to evaluate the relations between the additional diagnostic tests performed in the dry eye examination (osmolality, lactoferrin concentration, phenol red thread test, and lissamine green conjunctival staining) and our proposed definition of dry eye. The training plan and the research plan are closely related in this proposal. The research plan will produce a data set of adequate scope and size to allow Dr. Nichols to apply the epidemiologic and biostatistical theory learned in the classroom. Throughout the course of the training plan, Dr. Nichols will complete the Ph.D. program in Vision Science/Physiological Optics and the Master's in Public Health program with an emphasis in epidemiology and biostatistics at The Ohio State University. Together, the research plan and the training plan will provide Dr. Nichols with the skills and experience needed to excel as a patient-based clinician-scientist.  n/a",FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH DRY EYE IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN,6261256,K23EY000393,"['clinical research', ' environmental stressor', ' epidemiology', ' eye disorder diagnosis', ' female', ' fluorescent dye /probe', ' human subject', ' interview', ' keratoconjunctivitis sicca', ' longitudinal human study', ' physiologic stressor', ' postmenopause', ' questionnaires', ' statistics /biometry', "" women's health""]",NEI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,K23,2001,119812,241268189,-0.012084384085389208
"Automated (AI) Analysis of Sleep Disordered Breathing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) This training grant is designed to advance the academic career of Dr. Indu Ayappa by building on the applicant?s strong biomedical engineering and computer background and providing comprehensive multi-disciplinary training which will allow her to become an independent investigator. The applicant?s career goals are to enter full time academic research in sleep physiology. Training activities proposed will include academic course work designed to support the research program and expose her to aspects of clinical research in sleep, neural science and artificial intelligence techniques. She will be mentored by David Rapoport, M.D., Joyce Walsleben, Ph.D., and Maurice Ohayon, M.D., Ph.D., as well as faculty in computer science and neurophysiology. The aims of the planned research are to develop an artificial intelligence system for the identification and quantification of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) based solely on non-invasive cardiopulmonary signals collected during routine polysomnography. This will simplify, standardize and improve the diagnosis of SDB and facilitate research in this area. With the long term goal of physiologic characterization of the spectrum of SDB in order to clinically diagnose upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS), the aims of this project are to: 1. Extract features from the nasal cannula airflow signal to characterize the state of resistance/collapsibility of individual breaths. These include amplitude, inspiratory flow contour, Ti/Ttot and presence of vibration which will be used as inputs to a neural network that will be trained and evaluated against breaths that have been classified by reference measurement of upper airway resistance (pressure/flow). 2A. Incorporate information from this classification of individual breaths to detect and classify respiratory events based on the flow signal alone using a trained neural network. 2B. Evaluate the utility of including additional cardiopulmonary signals like oxygen saturation, heart rate, pulse transit time and rib/abdominal movements (amplitude and phase) in the detection and classification of these events. Successful completion of the training and research program will allow Dr. Ayappa to contribute independently to research in the field of sleep physiology. n/a",Automated (AI) Analysis of Sleep Disordered Breathing,6320670,K25HL004420,"['artificial intelligence', ' automated data processing', ' breath tests', ' cardiopulmonary disease', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' disease /disorder classification', ' electrocardiography', ' electroencephalography', ' electromyography', ' electrooculography', ' human subject', ' noninvasive diagnosis', ' patient oriented research', ' polysomnography', ' respiratory airflow disorder', ' respiratory airflow measurement', ' respiratory disorder diagnosis', ' sleep disorders']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K25,2001,147450,329565273,0.008451115173175807
"Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) The identification of electrographic            seizures during long-term EEG monitoring in the neonate is currently based upon      visual interpretation of the graphic record, a process that is very                  time-consuming. While significant progress has been made in the automated            detection of seizures in the adult population, relatively little work has been       done in the neonatal area. Therefore, the major objective of this project is         the development of techniques for the reliable automated detection of                electrographic seizures in the neonatal EEG. We propose a multi-stage, hybrid        approach to detection that will employ a combination of signal processing,           pattern recognition, neural networks, and expert rules. Through the successive       stages of the detection process, multichannel neonatal EEG data containing all       types of background activity and artifacts will be analyzed to detect and            classify electrographic seizures. We postulate that the varied types and             morphologies of seizures in the neonatal EEG, as compared to seizures in the         adult EEG, can best be detected and classified using this hybrid approach. We        will test the methods we develop on data recorded from infants in the Clinical       Research Center for Neonatal Seizures, The Methodist Hospital, in Houston,           Texas. We expect that the information we gain from the research will lead to         the development of a practical seizure detection system and further our              long-term goals of reduced expense in the reading and interpretation of              neonatal EEGs, and also facilitate the efficient collection of seizure               parameters for possible use in future research studies.                                                                                                                   n/a",Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG,6383999,R01NS040577,"['adult human (21+)', ' age difference', ' artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' biomedical equipment development', ' brain electrical activity', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' electroencephalography', ' epilepsy', ' human subject', ' newborn human (0-6 weeks)', ' patient monitoring device', ' patient oriented research']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2001,200999,31980265,-0.013200364442030385

COMPUTER AIDED CARDIAC MEASUREMENT The objective of the proposed research is to develop a method for providing fast and accurate measurements of volume and ejection fraction from 3D echo images. Our Computer Aided Measurement System will reconstruct the LV endocardium using a few user selected points on oriented echocardiographic images together with prior shape and size knowledge. The Specific Aims for Phase I are: 1. To improve the accuracy of quantitative echo while minimizing manual labor. 2. To improve the ease of use of the prototype system for application in a clinical setting. 3. To expand the catalog representing our knowledge base by acquiring additional large volume and abnormally shaped LV's in order to enhance fitting accuracy for atypical shapes. Previously described methods of analyzing echocardiograms in 3D require so much manual labor that this modality has been limited to research applications. The advantages of our proposed approach are that it makes the superior accuracy and reproducibility of 3D echo available for clinical practice. Furthermore this process will be applicable to other imaging modalities.

"MODEL BASED INTERPRETATION OF INTRACARDIAC ELECTROGRAMS Catheter ablation is a medical procedure that involves the destruction of        small volumes of heart tissue with radiofrequency energy.  To be                 successful, catheter ablation requires precise localization of the tissue        to be destroyed. To accomplish this in a typical ablation procedure, five        catheters containing a total of 19 electrode pairs are utilized to record        potentials (called electrograms) from spatially distinct locations within        the heart throughout the cardiac cycle. Experienced cardiologists                interpret the electrograms to locate the conduction pathways responsible         for the arrhythmia. The pathways are destroyed by applications of                radiofrequency energy, thus treating the arrhythmia.                                                                                                              Ablation procedures are performed by highly trained and experienced              cardiology sub-specialists yet the massive amount of data produced during        these procedures creates a data overload problem that can impede the             performance of even the best practitioners. This may be evidenced by (1)         overlooking important signal features, (2) misinterpreting the signals,          and (3) misinterpreting catheter locations in the heart, all of which may        lead to increased procedure duration and/or applications of radiofrequency       energy to the wrong part of the heart.                                                                                                                            The purpose of this project is to develop a model-based system for               interpreting intracardiac electrograms in near real-time. The system is          intended to assist physicians in ""making sense"" of the enormous amounts of       data recorded during a cardiac electrophysiology study. New computer             algorithms for reasoning about the time- and space-varying nature of             intracardiac electrograms from underlying causal models of the heart will        be developed. The models can be represented as a graph of nodes connected        by arcs. The nodes represent specific an atomic regions of the heart while       the arcs represent the connections between the regions.                                                                                                           The analytic approach will be a variation of the hypothesize-and-test            paradigm. The control loop will be based on the ""tracking"" concept whereby       models will be tracked as long as the data supports the model. Rule-based        knowledge will be utilized to generate models based on the observed data.        The output of the system will be a series of ladder diagrams describing          the data. In the event that the data admits more than a single explanatory       model, ladder diagrams will be generated for all created models.                                                                                                  This proposal is an extension of the applicant's graduate and post-              doctoral project, which used the same approach to the simpler domain of          the interpretation of the body-surface electrocardiogram. The domain of          this proposal is more complex because it adds reasoning with a more              detailed three dimensional cardiac model to the temporal reasoning               required for previous work. Also, this domain requires the ability to            account for simultaneous activation of the heart at multiple locations,          which was performed at a rudimentary level in the previous work.                                                                                                  This project is important for three reasons: (1) it offers new knowledge-        based algorithms for reasoning about time- and space-varying data, (2) a         comprehensive and extensible model of the cardiac conduction will be             created that incorporates the spatial resolution necessary for                   interpreting intracardiac electrograms, and (3) a software tool such the         one proposed may help clinicians improve the quality of health care.              n/a",MODEL BASED INTERPRETATION OF INTRACARDIAC ELECTROGRAMS,6126011,R29LM006004,"['arrhythmia', ' artificial intelligence', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' electrocardiography', ' heart catheterization', ' heart conduction system', ' human data', ' interactive multimedia', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development']",NLM,SOUTHWEST RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R29,2000,149839,0,-0.0006397408278598606
"NEW ROC METHODOLOGY TO ASSESS DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract):  Receiver Operating             Characteristic (ROC) analysis is recognized widely as the best way of            measuring and specifying the accuracies of diagnostic procedures, because it     is able to distinguish between actual differences in discrimination              capacity, on one hand, and apparent differences that are due only to             decision-threshold effects, on the other.  Key methodological needs remain       to be satisfied before ROC analysis can address all of the practically           important situations that arise in diagnostic applications, however.  This       project employs signal detection theory and computer simulation to address       several of those needs, by:  (1) refining and continuing distribution of         software developed previously by the applicants for fitting ROC curves and       for testing the statistical significance of differences between ROC curve        estimates; (2) developing and evaluating new algorithms for ROC                  curve-Fitting and statistical testing, based on their recently-developed         ""proper"" binormal model, that should provide more meaningful results in          experimental situations that involve small samples of cases; (3)                 investigating the usefulness of a form of ROC methodology that is based on       mixture distributions in order to rduce the need for diagnostic truth in ROC     experiments; (4) investigating the effect of case-saple difficulty on the        statistical power tests for differences between ROC curves, in order to          determine the optimal difficulty of cases that shouldbe studied on rank          diagnostic systems; and (5) developing methods for training artificial           neural networks (ANNs) to maximize diagnostic accuracy in terms of ROC           analysis and signal detection theory.                                             n/a",NEW ROC METHODOLOGY TO ASSESS DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY,6181168,R01GM057622,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' method development', ' statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2000,218176,246330700,-0.025509404017556084
