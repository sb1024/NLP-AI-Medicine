"Data-driven subtyping to find patients with drug interactions leading to stroke Project Summary Stroke is a highly heterogeneous and complex disease and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Identification of the cause of disease is essential for risk stratification and optimal treatment, but can be difficult, as up to 35% of causes are undetermined by traditional subtyping criteria and very few causative genetic variants have been found. In addition, certain causes may be hidden within the clinical picture of a patient, such as an adverse drug reaction. Using data-driven approaches to analyze the medical records of patients may uncover novel patterns of risk factors and clinical features leading to stroke. The long-term goal of this research is to identify novel subtypes of highly heterogeneous diseases such as stroke and to reduce the genetic heterogeneity of a disease cohort by identifying patients with the same subtype. The objective of this application is to propose a pipeline that applies a data-driven analysis of medical notes to identify novel subtypes of stroke, focus on a subtype caused by an adverse drug reaction or drug pair interaction, validate the subtype in a genotyped study cohort, and look for gene variant enrichment in this cohort. This application’s central hypothesis is that applying deep learning to the electronic health record (EHR) of acute ischemic stroke patients will form subtypes based on more granular information than currently implemented and with reduced genetic heterogeneity by identifying novel patterns of risk factors and clinical picture leading to the stroke. In addition, we hypothesize that at least one subtype will identify patients whose stroke is an adverse drug reaction or drug-drug interaction. To do this, Aim 1 will first identify all acute ischemic stroke patients in the EHR by developing a machine learning classifier trained on structured data in the EHR. Aim 2 will then build and train an unsupervised deep learning algorithm on text from medical notes to identify clusters, or subtypes, of patients with similar clinical pictures. Aim 3 will finally validate reduction in genetic heterogeneity of these cohorts by estimating observational heritability of all subtypes using a tool created in our lab and comparing this with the heritability estimates of subtypes derived from physician-based criteria. It will also focus on a not well-studied subtype, stroke due to an adverse drug reaction or drug-drug interaction, by identifying its enrichment in the novel subtypes, validating this subtype in a study cohort with genotyped data, and finally looking for enrichment of pharmacogenetic variants in this subtype. These aims will generate a computational pipeline that identifies novel subtypes of acute ischemic stroke, enabling improved future genetic studies by reducing genetic heterogeneity of cohorts and improved understanding of the underlying causes of the disease. Project Narrative Stroke is a highly complex disease that is a leading cause of death and severe disability. Identifying the cause of stroke is essential for risk stratification and optimal treatment, but up to a third of cases are of undetermined cause, and very few genetic variants have been identified due to the heterogeneity of the disease. To address this, this research proposal develops a computational pipeline that applies data-driven deep learning to medical notes to identify novel combinations of environmental, genetic, and medical risk factors causing the disease; this tool may clarify the etiology of unknown stroke cases, provide cohorts of patients enriched with similar genetic variants, and be expanded to subtype any disease.",Data-driven subtyping to find patients with drug interactions leading to stroke,9999028,F30HL140946,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heritability', 'Internet', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acute stroke', 'adverse drug reaction', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'computational pipelines', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease heterogeneity', 'experience', 'falls', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'learning classifier', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient health information', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'population based', 'random forest', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'structured data', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F30,2020,50016,558628098,0.24130024486329532
"A Machine Learning Approach For CTA-based Plaque Characterization and Stroke Risk Prediction in Carotid Artery Atherosclerosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Carotid artery atherosclerosis is a major vascular risk factor and accounts for approximately 15% of all strokes. A major risk marker in patients with carotid atherosclerosis has been the degree of narrowing, or stenosis, of the carotid artery lumen. While stenosis is often quantified via angiography, imaging can also provide detailed assessments of plaque. Our project is motivated by converging data that correlate vulnerable plaque elements, which can be captured with imaging, with increased stroke risk. Identifying high-risk or vulnerable carotid plaques before a stroke occurs is important because stroke prevention treatments, like carotid endarterectomy or stenting, carry risks and ideally should only be performed only those patients at highest risk of stroke. CTA (computed tomographic angiography) is an attractive tool for plaque imaging since it is not operator dependent, can be quickly performed, and is more widely available than MRI. Although CTA offers significant potential to evaluate these plaque features, small studies have not reached a consensus regarding their reliability and clinical relevance. In this project, we plan to explore the utility of CTA for the detailed carotid vessel wall imaging by employing a unique, large-scale clinical dataset and advanced algorithms. Our overarching objective in this R21 project is to conduct developmental and interdisciplinary research that will lay the foundation for the implementation and validation of novel CTA-based technologies that can be adopted in the risk stratification of patients with carotid atherosclerosis. Our central hypothesis is that there are CTA-based carotid plaque features that can be reliably extracted and used for stroke risk stratification, which will be more sensitive and specific than standard stenosis grading. To pursue our objective, we will pursue two specific aims: In Specific Aim 1 we plan to optimize the use of human reader defined plaque features in predicting culprit carotid plaques. We will perform a blinded, multi-reader study of CTA-derived carotid plaque features in a large scale clinical dataset to test the association between CTA-derived human-defined features and stroke, and compute accuracy metrics. In Specific Aim 2, we plan to develop algorithms to automatically characterize and discriminate culprit carotid plaque in CTA. We will implement and test image processing algorithms that automatically compute from a CTA scan stroke-associated carotid artery plaque features (from Aim 1), and then train a machine learning algorithm to distinguish culprit from asymptomatic carotid artery plaques. We believe that this R21 study is significant because it will establish a novel, machine learning-aided imaging strategy which can aid in identifying high-risk carotid artery plaques before they cause stroke and when they can be properly treated to prevent stroke from occurring in the future. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because the discovery of novel and treatable vascular risk factors will ultimately improve risk factor screening and stroke prevention efforts, thereby reducing the incidence of a disabling and lethal disease. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NHLBI's mission that involves reducing the burden of vascular disease by fostering research on prevention.",A Machine Learning Approach For CTA-based Plaque Characterization and Stroke Risk Prediction in Carotid Artery Atherosclerosis,9904175,R21HL145427,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Carotid Endarterectomy', 'Carotid Stenosis', 'Carotid stent', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Ischemia', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Statistical Models', 'Stenosis', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Ulcer', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'calcification', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'feature extraction', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'stroke patient', 'stroke risk', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'vascular risk factor']",NHLBI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2020,121967,227555357,0.28282739711447946
"Point-of-Care CT Perfusion (PoC CT-P) for Early Stroke Assessment Abstract The goal of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a portable and affordable cranial x-ray-based Computed Tomography Perfusion (CT-P) device for expedited front-line evaluation and triage of ischemic cerebral stroke victims. CT-P is the gold standard modality for assessment and classifying stroke patients to determine the best candidates for revascularizing procedures; however, CT-P is generally unavailable early in the current acute care treatment model. Unlike existing conventional CT-P equipment which is generally large, expensive, and stationary, the proposed device would be compact, portable, and affordable to be deployed in nursing homes, urgent care centers, hospital ER triage areas, ICUs, and EMS response vehicles, yet also provide sufficient time and contrast resolution for reliable perfusion metrics. Rapidly acquired point-of-care CT and CT-P images showing blood flow, volume, and transit times will enable (1) early classification of hemorrhage or ischemic, and (2) assessment of the recoverable brain tissue volume. This will enable early screening evaluation for appropriate acute stroke patient prioritization and routing. In addition, it may also provide an economical and safe bedside means of assessing cranial perfusion for follow up care in the ICU, recovery room, or even eventually in a residential care setting. Xoran Technologies LLC specializes in point-of-care (POC) medical imaging and has successfully marketed over 750 POC imaging devices in the US. Project Narrative When an individual is suffering from acute stroke, time is of the essence; however, it is critically important to assess the type of stroke as well as the amount and location of potentially recoverable brain tissue to determine the appropriate routing and priority to achieve the best outcome for that individual. In this project a new compact and portable device is proposed that allows cranial perfusion studies to be performed earlier in the process than the current standard of care, potentially in a nursing home, urgent care center, or in an emergency vehicle such as an ambulance. Public health is affected both by the potential for improved outcomes for individuals, but also for systemwide cost savings and efficiency gains by not transporting patients who are not likely to benefit from a trip to a level one stroke treatment center.",Point-of-Care CT Perfusion (PoC CT-P) for Early Stroke Assessment,10009036,R43NS117244,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Ambulances', 'American Stroke Association', 'Area', 'Blood flow', 'Caliber', 'Caring', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebral Infarction', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Cities', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cost Savings', 'Cost efficiency', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Emergency Situation', 'Equipment', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health care facility', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Ischemia', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Military Personnel', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nursing Homes', 'Ocular orbit', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery Room', 'Residential Treatment', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Rotation', 'Route', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Service delivery model', 'Services', 'Slice', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Technology', 'Teleradiology', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vascularization', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute care', 'acute stroke', 'arm', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinical center', 'commercial application', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'design', 'disability', 'early screening', 'follow-up', 'functional independence', 'imager', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'phantom model', 'point of care', 'portability', 'product development', 'prototype', 'radiologist', 'response', 'rural area', 'standard of care', 'stroke patient', 'stroke symptom', 'stroke therapy', 'stroke victims', 'treatment center', 'urgent care']",NINDS,"XORAN TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R43,2020,249154,1528783,0.17645130323555336
"Ultrafast Quantitative pH MRI for Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients ABSTRACT Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. The goal of acute ischemic stroke therapy is to salvage tissue that is at risk of infarction, but still viable, through the use of reperfusion strategies. Current reperfusion therapies are limited by a tight time window for treatment and by the potential risk of brain hemorrhage. Using this time-based approach, only a limited number of stroke patients are eligible for treatment. Patients who present beyond the standard treatment time windows can benefit from therapy when identified based on multimodal MRI; however, precise and accurate identification of the salvageable tissue is essential, as the potential beneficial effect of treatment must be weighed against the risk of hemorrhage. Although a diffusion/perfusion MRI mismatch has been suggested as a guide with which to identify the presence of salvageable tissues and to serve as a selection marker for thrombolysis, the results of clinical trials using this criterion have been inconclusive, in part because of the inclusion of regions of oligemia in the penumbra, which overestimates the size of the tissue at risk. Amide proton transfer (APT) MRI has shown promise in detecting such an acidosis-based ischemic penumbra in animal models and in human stroke patients. However, most currently used APT imaging protocols are not very practical and not optimized with respect to the magnitude of signal changes caused by the pH effect. More quantitative APT-MRI typically would require an even longer scan time due to the use of multiple RF saturation frequencies, multiple acquisitions, and a long RF saturation pulse (or pulse train), all of which hamper clinical translation due to the very small time-window between stroke onset and possible thrombolysis treatment. Our long-term goal is to develop an ultrafast pH imaging technique for routine clinical use to guide reperfusion therapies for hyperacute stroke patients at various therapeutic time windows, as well as predict the risk of hemorrhagic transformation (HT) following acute ischemic stroke. The first clinical hypothesis is that, similar to animal studies, the pH imaging penumbra due to ischemic tissue acidosis predicts the maximum final infarction size if no reperfusion is initiated. Our second clinical hypothesis is that the presence of severe tissue acidosis in the ischemic core is associated with an increased probability of secondary HT. Our hypotheses will be tested through three specific aims: 1) to develop and optimize an ultrafast quantitative pH imaging method; 2) to validate this technique and assess the diagnostic accuracy of the acidosis-based ischemic penumbra in a clinical setting; and 3) to develop a novel deep-learning model with which to predict HT following acute ischemic stroke, and quantify the sensitivity and specificity of pH imaging. This work is expected to accelerate the translation of APT-MRI into a clinically viable and robust method. The addition of pH imaging to the standard MRI protocol is expected to enable better visualization of the true ischemic penumbra, thus improving predictions of clinical outcome and reducing the incidence of HT. NARRATIVE This research proposal is designed to optimize the speed and evaluate the accuracy of a novel pH MRI technique for identifying stroke patients with salvageable brain regions, as well as patients at increased risk for developing hemorrhage after an acute ischemic stroke. The results would enhance patient selection for treatment, extend the therapeutic time window, and improve the risk-benefit ratio of recanalization therapies.",Ultrafast Quantitative pH MRI for Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients,9968624,R01NS112242,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acidosis', 'Acute', 'Alteplase', 'Amides', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cause of Death', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Infarction', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Ischemic Penumbra', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research Proposals', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombectomy', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'blood-brain barrier permeabilization', 'clinical translation', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'human imaging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'predict clinical outcome', 'radio frequency', 'risk benefit ratio', 'standard care', 'stroke patient', 'stroke therapy', 'targeted treatment', 'thrombolysis', 'time use', 'treatment effect']",NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,384813,807432003,0.24620219515347877
"Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) Nearly 800,000 people in the United States (US) each year are affected by stroke, which remains the leading cause of adult disability and 5th leading cause of death. Despite the proliferation of stroke centers nationwide, access to timely stroke care and evidence-based therapies is still poor with multiple inefficiencies, redundancies, errors, and system-based barriers that lead to care fragmentation. A stroke system of care that integrates and coordinates care between non-stroke center hospitals, primary stroke centers, and comprehensive stroke centers has been recommended since it would reduce stroke-related deaths by 20,000 annually in the US and nearly 400,000 worldwide. This proposal is significant because it addresses two important gaps in knowledge about the acute evaluation and treatment of stroke patients: prehospital screening errors and delays in inter-hospital transfer. The Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) study will (1) enhance existing LVO screening tools, assess whether machine learning approaches improve LVO prediction, and evaluate the impact of an Enhanced LVO Screening Tool in the prehospital setting; and (2) use learning collaboratives and simulations to design, implement, and pilot test a new inter-hospital stroke transfer protocol. We bring together systems engineers and stroke health service researchers in a novel collaboration that will produce generalizable knowledge that can be widely applied to other urban regions of the country and provide preliminary data and demonstration of novel approaches that could be evaluated in large-scale comparative effectiveness studies across multiple regions. NARRATIVE Timely acute stroke treatments can be life-saving and reduce disability from stroke; however, a minority of patients receive these treatments in a timely manner or at all.

"A Machine Learning Approach to Classifying Time Since Stroke using Medical Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) is the dominant and most proven treatment option, but its use is only indicated within 4.5 hours following a stroke. Unfortunately, up to 30% of stroke patients present with an unknown time since stroke (TSS) symptom onset, which makes them ineligible to receive IV tPA. Many of these individuals could be spared severe morbidity or mortality if there existed an alternative method for establishing TSS, allowing them to be identified and treated. This proposal will develop machine learning methods to create a physiologically grounded method for predicting TSS based on multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) imaging data. We believe our proposed techniques will outperform state-of-the-art methods that are based on subjective image interpretation, and have the potential to provide an objective data point that may be used in conjunction with the subjective assessments of experts, or in clinical environments that lack expertise in stroke imaging Research has established that MR and CT imaging captures information that correlates with TSS. However, existing methods for extracting this information are based on a physician subjectively interpreting the images and delineating regions of interest, processes that have been documented to have only weak to moderate agreement across trained expert reviewers. An automated approach that comprehensively analyzes the spectrum of imaging data could identify complex relationships across channels that more accurately classify TSS. For example, in MR, diffusion-weighted, perfusion-weighted, and fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging all play important roles in characterizing a stroke, but a deep understanding of how each channel may be combined to describe TSS is unknown. We propose to establish new deep learning methods for fusing this information. Specifically, we will: 1) develop a machine learning framework for classifying TSS; 2) develop a deep convolutional autoencoder to generate novel multimodal image representations from MR and CT to improve classification; and 3) implement visualization techniques that elucidate the relationship between deep features and pathophysiological stroke processes. Under this project, we will use data from the UCLA and UCI Stroke Centers, allowing us to study different patient populations and imaging techniques. The successful completion of this research will provide a new method for estimating TSS from imaging, leading to new prospective trials for providing therapy to patients with unknown TSS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year; however patients who present with an unknown stroke onset time are ineli- gible for receiving the leading therapy.

"Longitudinal and quantitative MR plaque imaging for prediction of response to medical management in symptomatic intracranial atherosclerosis ABSTRACT Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is one of the most common causes of ischemic stroke worldwide. Despite intensive medical management, the current standard of care for secondary stroke prevention, the rate of recurrent stroke is 13% in the first year and as high as 35% in certain populations by 2 years. Currently, the initial and follow-up evaluations of these patients rely exclusively on assessments of clinical risk factors and, in some circumstances, the degree of luminal stenosis on imaging. However, this strategy may overlook subtle non-luminal changes within ICAD lesions. A tool that can directly probe atherosclerotic plaques and accurately quantify longitudinal changes of plaque features may help early identify non-responsive patients in whom an alternative therapy can be initiated. Magnetic resonance (MR) vessel wall imaging (VWI) has the potential to fulfill this role because of its compacity to directly visualize the vessel wall and characterize plaque features. However, there are several technical challenges associated with intracranial VWI: small size, tortuous course, and deep sitting warrant a high-resolution and 3D imaging approach; multiple lesion sites require a large imaging view; signals arising from neighboring blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) need to be adequately suppressed; relatively long imaging time and potential image corruption by patient motion; and lack of dedicated plaque analysis tools particularly for 3D dataset. In this proposal, we will develop a reliable 3D VWI- based MR plaque imaging (MRPI) strategy for prediction of response to medical management in symptomatic ICAD. Specifically, we will first develop a whole-brain 3D VWI sequence with intracranial vessel-dedicated motion compensation and motion-adaptive imaging acceleration (Aim1-Task1) and develop an automated intracranial vessel wall (IVA) tool integrating 3D vessel wall segmentation and computational algorithms for deriving quantitative plaque features (Aim1-Task2) followed by a validation study (Aim1-Task3). The validated techniques will then be used in a cross-sectional study to determine the MRPI-derived quantitative plaque features that are associated with ICAD lesions within the infarcted territory in patients with acute symptomatic ICAD (Aim 2). We will finally conduct a longitudinal study to determine the capacity of longitudinal and quantitative MRPI to predict response to medical management in symptomatic ICAD patients (Aim 3). Successful completion of the project will validate the compacity of VWI-based MRPI to quantitatively characterize ICAD and predict response to medical management in symptomatic ICAD patients. This will open the door to future clinical trials investigating the role of MRPI in developing personalized management paradigms and assessing new therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atherosclerosis in the brain is an important cause of ischemic stroke worldwide and carries a high risk of recurrent stroke despite treatment.

"Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data It is a common clinical occurrence that neuroimaging scans obtained in the course of routine clinical care discover a prior brain infarction in patients with no history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Indeed, epidemiologic studies indicate that silent brain infarctions (SBI) are far more common than strokes; MRI- defined SBI can be detected in ~20% of the healthy elderly. In these studies based on screened patients, the findings have been shown to be associated with subtle, typically unrecognized, deficits in physical and cognitive function. These imaging findings are also strong, independent risk factors for future stroke and dementia. Despite the very high prevalence of SBI in screened populations, and their serious consequences, little is known about the significance or the appropriate management of SBI when discovered incidentally in routine care. While there is strong evidence that antiplatelet therapy and statin therapy are effective in preventing recurrent stroke in patients with prior stroke, the degree to which these results apply to patients with SBI is unclear. Because patients with SBI define a population that falls in between primary and secondary stroke prevention, the approach to these patients is marked by uncertainty and practice variation, making it an ideal condition for observational comparative effectiveness research. Nonetheless, there are serious challenges for the study of SBI. As patients have no overt symptoms, recruitment into a trial can be problematic. Comparative effectiveness research on SBI, using routinely collected data and leveraging the variation in care of these patients, is impeded by the fact that there are no ICD codes for SBI, and it is generally not included in structured fields of electronic health records (EHR) as it is typically considered an incidental finding. In order to establish the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies for SBI in a large, heterogeneous population, we propose to develop Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to identify individuals with SBI through the automated review of neuroradiology reports. We have performed preliminary work to demonstrate that such an approach is feasible. We will then apply state-of-the-science observational comparative effectiveness methods in a massive database with linked EHR and claims data to examine the effectiveness of statins and antiplatelet agents in preventing future stroke and dementia. Thus, our aims are: Aim 1: We will develop NLP algorithms that can accurately identify cases of SBI and white matter disease (WMD) in two different health systems. Aim 2: We will port, refine, and validate the NLP algorithm in a large heterogeneous database including more than 600 hospitals and 6500 clinics and identify a large cohort of patients with routinely-discovered SBI and WMD. Aim 3: We will characterize the cohort with respect to age- specific prevalence of SBI, management patterns, and the risk of future stroke and dementia associated with SBI and WMD. Aim 4: We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of preventive therapies (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally-discovered SBI. The goal of this project is to improve the evidence base for the prevention of stroke in patients with “silent brain infarct”—i.e., a stroke on neuroimaging (head CT or MRI) but no clinical evidence of a stroke. We will develop a computer-based algorithm using a technology known as natural language processing that can accurately identify cases of silent brain infarction among a large population of adults on whom neuroimages have been obtained, but who are without a history of clinically-evident cerebrovascular disease. We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of medications (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally discovered and reported SBI.",Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data,9931326,R01NS102233,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'American Stroke Association', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Infarction', 'Caring', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention approach', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive therapy', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'White Matter Disease', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'case finding', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'falls', 'improved', 'learning progression', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient screening', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'repository', 'routine care', 'screening', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,520509,17640378,0.273588154439618
"Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are critical to identify because prevention therapy can reduce the risk of future vascular events by > 50%. Diagnostic testing and therapeutic intervention must start as soon as possible because 10-25% of TIAs have a stroke within 90 days. Because so many patients present emergently with transient neurological events the large majority of whom do not go on to have a stroke, methods for identifying TIAs at high risk for stroke have been sought so that work up and treatment can be targeted to those who need it most to save time, money and limited resources. Though the ABCD2 score and brain Diffusion Weighted Imaging-MRI (DWI-MRI) have improved prediction of which TIAs have a stroke, their sensitivity and specificity for prediction of individual cases i poor. In this proposal we propose that peripheral blood leukocytes and platelets play pivotal roles in which TIAs go on to have a stroke and by assessing RNA in whole blood we can evaluate leukocyte and platelet function in TIA patients who go on to have stroke versus those that do not have a stroke. We hypothesize that specific coagulation and immune genes are activated in TIA patients that predispose them to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIA patients who do NOT have a stroke by 90 days. A subset of these leukocyte and platelet mRNA genes will predict TIAs who have a stroke by 90 days. This hypothesis is addressed by the following specific aims. Aim #1 (Derivation Cohort): Demonstrate that mRNA expression measured using RNAseq from whole blood differs in a derivation cohort of TIAs that go on to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIAs who do not have a stroke by 90 days. Demonstrate that most mRNA found to be regulated using RNAseq are also significantly regulated when measured using qRT-PCR. Aim #2 (Derivation Cohort): Apply machine learning algorithms to the mRNA from Aim #1 to derive an optimal subset of mRNA regulated by both RNAseq and qRT-PCR that predict which TIAs have strokes by 90 days compared to those who do not with >95% sensitivity on cross-validation. Aim #3 (Validation Cohort): Use machine/prediction learning algorithms to demonstrate that the genes from Aim #2 when measured using qRT-PCR on an independent validation cohort predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days with >85% sensitivity. The goal of these studies is to discover mRNA profiles in blood that predict which TIA patients go on to have strokes by 90 days. When confirmed in future studies, this will direct in depth testing to those high risk TIAs most in need in order to prevent strokes, and decrease unnecessary testing in those with low risk of stroke. Equally as important, the genes discovered to be associated with high risk of stroke in TIA patients will represent potential novel stroke prevention targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine RNA in blood using RNAseq and qRT-PCR of human subjects with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) who have a stroke by 90 days compared to TIAs who do not have a stroke. The regulated mRNA, exons and alternatively spliced transcripts in a Derivation Cohort of TIA patients will be used to predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days in a Validation Cohort of TIA patients.",Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs),9896876,R01NS097000,"['Address', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Labyrinthine disorder', 'Leukocytes', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Migraine', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prevention therapy', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA', 'ROC Curve', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'cohort', 'emergency settings', 'gene discovery', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'mRNA Expression', 'machine learning algorithm', 'monocyte', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'platelet function', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'release factor', 'stroke risk', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2020,544777,254622553,0.38851526230826955
"Automatic Quantification and Labeling of Cerebral Microbleeds, Oxygen Saturation and Sources of Abnormal Susceptibility ABSTRACT The detection, localization and quantification of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) plays an important role in diagnosing and establishing appropriate treatment plans in neurodegenerative diseases specifically in vascular dementia (VaD). To date, evaluating CMBs is time consuming, inaccurate and sometimes not possible. We propose to mitigate these problems by developing our software, “qSPIN”, that will provide fast and easy-to-use methods for: 1) automatic identification of CMBs and veins, 2) automatic quantification of CMBs, 3) automatic quantification of oxygen saturation in veins, and 4) creation of a user-friendly software for the practicing radiologist. Recent developments in MRI have provided a new means by which to study the role of CMBs and venous abnormalities in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), VaD, stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) has proven to be a powerful tool by which to detect CMBs and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) can be used to measure changes in oxygen saturation. Knowing how many CMBs there are can predict the onset of VaD, determine whether anti-platelet therapy in stroke should be used, and correlate with neuropsychological outcome for patients with TBI. Our recent version of multi-echo SWI makes it possible to obtain both an arteriogram and a venogram simultaneously. Oxygen saturation can also be used to monitor perfusion changes and extend the window of treatment in stroke.  Currently, most radiologists and technologists do not have time to perform such detailed quantitative processing and thus it is not being done clinically. Our qSPIN software will provide this quantitative data. With the number, size, and location of CMBs or venous abnormalities, a better diagnosis would be possible. Our group is uniquely positioned to address this problem having developed many of these techniques. The novelty of our approach is the marriage of SWI, QSM, STAGE and deep learning techniques to detect these vascular and functional abnormalities. To accomplish the goals of this proposal, we will develop user friendly software that incorporates all imaging information from SWI and QSM to label CMBs. We will also provide the location of the CMBs in Talairach coordinates using a template dataset. In the end, we will have a complete picture of the prevalence of CMBs, abnormal oxygen saturation and their locations in patients with neurodegenerative disease that will improve diagnosis and potentially change their treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is a huge demand today for a comprehensive analysis of diseases with cerebral microbleeds, abnormal oxygen saturation and thrombosis such as vascular dementia. The quantification of these features will have major ramifications for the diagnosis and treatment of dementia as well hypertension, stroke and traumatic brain injury all of which can lead to dementia. Therefore, our major objective in this application is to design and develop advanced image processing software that can rapidly and accurately identify and quantify the presence of cerebral microbleeds and changes in oxygen saturation in dementia and related diseases.","Automatic Quantification and Labeling of Cerebral Microbleeds, Oxygen Saturation and Sources of Abnormal Susceptibility",10026456,R44HL145826,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Arteriogram', 'Arteriosclerosis', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Businesses', 'Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse Axonal Injury', 'Disease', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Infarction', 'Iron', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Maps', 'Marriage', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Published Comment', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stroke', 'TBI Patients', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Veins', 'Venous', 'base', 'cerebral microbleeds', 'cerebral vein', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast imaging', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurovascular', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'stroke risk', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'user friendly software']",NHLBI,"MAGNETIC RESONANCE INNOVATIONS, INC.",R44,2020,667050,667050,0.0879587972976856
"Prehospital Diagnostic Biomarker for Large Vessel Occlusion Background: The incidence of Large Vessel Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) has been estimated to be approximately 250,000 patients per year in the United States and is the leading cause of disability and fifth leading cause of death. Although interventional (stentriever) and pharmaceutical (tPA) treatments exist for large vessel occlusion (LVO), their use is limited due to the short time window from symptom onset that these treatments are indicated to be administered in. Moreover, recent estimates suggest only approximately 10% of eligible patients receive interventional treatment which has shown to lead to better outcomes in several worldwide RCTs. In order for intervention to be successful, a standardized, quantitative, field based (pre- hospital) diagnostic tool is needed to improve LVO identification and ensure rapid transfer to a capable medical facility. Currently, the gold standard for stroke diagnosis is CT angiogram (CTA) which is limited to in-hospital use or a low number of mobile stroke ambulances, all costing multi-millions of dollars, requiring expert operators and IV injection of iodine-rich contrast material. Additionally, the clinical stroke assessment scales (RACE, LAMS, CPSS) used in the field although low cost and non-invasive have proven unreliable due to training requirements and low inherent accuracies, with SEN and SPE ranging in a recent study from 0.50-0.64 and 0.83-0.92, respectively. Project Goals and Broad Specific Aims: Validate a biomarker for LVO assessment which can be measured and displayed with a fully automated, non-invasive, transcranial Doppler (TCD) robotic system with performance at or exceeding 90% ROC–AUC (targeting SEN & SPE greater than 90%) to standard of care imaging. Complete a clinical study where Arm 1 demonstrates technical feasibility of the system in acute stroke settings and Arm 2 demonstrates safety, no detrimental change to standard of care, and collect robust data to submit to the FDA an IFU expansion to drive clinical care using our robotic system and the biomarker. The ultimate and future goal of this work is to use the automated device and validated VCI biomarker in a prehospital setting to show improved clinical outcomes after stroke onset due to improved prehospital triage. This work is critical to first validate the biomarker against gold standard CTA, which must be completed in a hospital, to ultimately be used in the pre-hospital setting. Longterm Objective: CTA will not be replaced in comprehensive stroke centers and we do not aim to use our technology to do this in comprehensive centers with CTA. Instead, our technology will be available in centers without CTA or MRA and ultimately in the prehospital environment. The goal of our company is to show that our lower cost, portable, non invasive technology can be used to measure a valid biomarker of large vessel occlusion that can be performed outside of a comprehensive stroke center. The first step is to validate the biomarker, in a center with CTA as a gold standard, which is the ultimate goal of this work.

"Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke Project Summary / Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the world’s most common serious heart rhythm problem and causes 15% of all strokes, a major cause of disability and death among Americans. Long-term monitoring for early AF detection and treatment is recommended for many stroke patients, but although existing cardiac monitors are accurate, they suffer from methodologic and cost limitations that preclude their long-term use. In the proposed, “Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation Real-Time in Stroke,” Study, our overall objective is to enhance paroxysmal AF (pAF) detection by enhancing and testing Pulsewatch, an innovative, smartwatch-based technology for long-term rhythm monitoring of stroke patients. For Aim 1, we embed our state-of-the art AF detection algorithms, interactive messaging to promote adherence, and novel contact and motion noise correction capabilities into a smartwatch to enable near-continuous pulse waveform analysis. We will further refine Pulsewatch through focus groups and a Hack-a-thon with stroke patients and their medical providers. For Aim 2, we will enroll 90 stroke survivors and provide them with a smartphone and smartwatch, both encoded with Pulsewatch. We will compare the performance of Pulsewatch when worn daily for 7 days to conventional 7-day cardiac monitoring for pAF detection. For Aim 3, we will determine the acceptability and usability of Pulsewatch through follow-up interviews and focus groups in 30 randomly selected participants from Aim 2 asked to continue wearing smartwatch daily for an additional 30 days. We will identify patient factors associated with adherence and evaluate the impact of Pulsewatch use on disease-specific quality of life, anxiety, and self- activation among the 30 users compared to 30 stroke patients treated with usual care through baseline and 1- month assessments. Our research will lead to the development of a highly acceptable, enabling cardiovascular monitoring technology designed by, and for, stroke patients that facilitates long-term non-invasive screening for pAF, as well as communication between stroke patients and their medical providers.

"Detecting bleeding events using EHRs for prediction in Afib Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects millions of mostly older Americans. Atrial fibrillation contributes to stroke and weighing stroke risk against risk of bleeding from oral anticoagulants (AC) is central to AF management. AC decision-making has become more complex in recent years with the introduction of several target specific oral AC agents. It remains challenging to advise older AF patients about AC since they are frequently at high risk for stroke and complications from AC, particularly bleeding, and data are limited on real-world outcomes of AC among vulnerable populations. Our project, Detecting bleeding Events using Electronic records for Prediction in Atrial Fibrillation (DEEP AF), will leverage novel biomedical natural language processing (NLP) approaches to integrate bleeding-related information from both the structured and unstructured EHR records and statistical and deep learning approaches to predict risk of bleeding on AF patients on AC therapy. DEEP AF will address present knowledge gaps to accurately identify bleeding events from longitudinal electronic health records and to improve bleeding prediction accuracy and focus on modifiable, clinically relevant risk factors, thereby facilitating future large-scale comparative effectiveness studies evaluating AC agents, and helping clinicians develop better approaches to weighing AC risks and benefits.

"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),9889924,P50DC014664,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Employment', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Savings', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'behavior test', 'chronic stroke', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'predicting response', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2020,2187036,45219910,0.21109447710176174
"Data-driven subtyping to find patients with drug interactions leading to stroke Project Summary Stroke is a highly heterogeneous and complex disease and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Identification of the cause of disease is essential for risk stratification and optimal treatment, but can be difficult, as up to 35% of causes are undetermined by traditional subtyping criteria and very few causative genetic variants have been found. In addition, certain causes may be hidden within the clinical picture of a patient, such as an adverse drug reaction. Using data-driven approaches to analyze the medical records of patients may uncover novel patterns of risk factors and clinical features leading to stroke. The long-term goal of this research is to identify novel subtypes of highly heterogeneous diseases such as stroke and to reduce the genetic heterogeneity of a disease cohort by identifying patients with the same subtype. The objective of this application is to propose a pipeline that applies a data-driven analysis of medical notes to identify novel subtypes of stroke, focus on a subtype caused by an adverse drug reaction or drug pair interaction, validate the subtype in a genotyped study cohort, and look for gene variant enrichment in this cohort. This application’s central hypothesis is that applying deep learning to the electronic health record (EHR) of acute ischemic stroke patients will form subtypes based on more granular information than currently implemented and with reduced genetic heterogeneity by identifying novel patterns of risk factors and clinical picture leading to the stroke. In addition, we hypothesize that at least one subtype will identify patients whose stroke is an adverse drug reaction or drug-drug interaction. To do this, Aim 1 will first identify all acute ischemic stroke patients in the EHR by developing a machine learning classifier trained on structured data in the EHR. Aim 2 will then build and train an unsupervised deep learning algorithm on text from medical notes to identify clusters, or subtypes, of patients with similar clinical pictures. Aim 3 will finally validate reduction in genetic heterogeneity of these cohorts by estimating observational heritability of all subtypes using a tool created in our lab and comparing this with the heritability estimates of subtypes derived from physician-based criteria. It will also focus on a not well-studied subtype, stroke due to an adverse drug reaction or drug-drug interaction, by identifying its enrichment in the novel subtypes, validating this subtype in a study cohort with genotyped data, and finally looking for enrichment of pharmacogenetic variants in this subtype. These aims will generate a computational pipeline that identifies novel subtypes of acute ischemic stroke, enabling improved future genetic studies by reducing genetic heterogeneity of cohorts and improved understanding of the underlying causes of the disease. Project Narrative Stroke is a highly complex disease that is a leading cause of death and severe disability. Identifying the cause of stroke is essential for risk stratification and optimal treatment, but up to a third of cases are of undetermined cause, and very few genetic variants have been identified due to the heterogeneity of the disease. To address this, this research proposal develops a computational pipeline that applies data-driven deep learning to medical notes to identify novel combinations of environmental, genetic, and medical risk factors causing the disease; this tool may clarify the etiology of unknown stroke cases, provide cohorts of patients enriched with similar genetic variants, and be expanded to subtype any disease.",Data-driven subtyping to find patients with drug interactions leading to stroke,9772123,F30HL140946,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heritability', 'Internet', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acute stroke', 'adverse drug reaction', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease heterogeneity', 'experience', 'falls', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'population based', 'random forest', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F30,2019,50016,558628098,0.24130024486329532
"A Machine Learning Approach For CTA-based Plaque Characterization and Stroke Risk Prediction in Carotid Artery Atherosclerosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Carotid artery atherosclerosis is a major vascular risk factor and accounts for approximately 15% of all strokes. A major risk marker in patients with carotid atherosclerosis has been the degree of narrowing, or stenosis, of the carotid artery lumen. While stenosis is often quantified via angiography, imaging can also provide detailed assessments of plaque. Our project is motivated by converging data that correlate vulnerable plaque elements, which can be captured with imaging, with increased stroke risk. Identifying high-risk or vulnerable carotid plaques before a stroke occurs is important because stroke prevention treatments, like carotid endarterectomy or stenting, carry risks and ideally should only be performed only those patients at highest risk of stroke. CTA (computed tomographic angiography) is an attractive tool for plaque imaging since it is not operator dependent, can be quickly performed, and is more widely available than MRI. Although CTA offers significant potential to evaluate these plaque features, small studies have not reached a consensus regarding their reliability and clinical relevance. In this project, we plan to explore the utility of CTA for the detailed carotid vessel wall imaging by employing a unique, large-scale clinical dataset and advanced algorithms. Our overarching objective in this R21 project is to conduct developmental and interdisciplinary research that will lay the foundation for the implementation and validation of novel CTA-based technologies that can be adopted in the risk stratification of patients with carotid atherosclerosis. Our central hypothesis is that there are CTA-based carotid plaque features that can be reliably extracted and used for stroke risk stratification, which will be more sensitive and specific than standard stenosis grading. To pursue our objective, we will pursue two specific aims: In Specific Aim 1 we plan to optimize the use of human reader defined plaque features in predicting culprit carotid plaques. We will perform a blinded, multi-reader study of CTA-derived carotid plaque features in a large scale clinical dataset to test the association between CTA-derived human-defined features and stroke, and compute accuracy metrics. In Specific Aim 2, we plan to develop algorithms to automatically characterize and discriminate culprit carotid plaque in CTA. We will implement and test image processing algorithms that automatically compute from a CTA scan stroke-associated carotid artery plaque features (from Aim 1), and then train a machine learning algorithm to distinguish culprit from asymptomatic carotid artery plaques. We believe that this R21 study is significant because it will establish a novel, machine learning-aided imaging strategy which can aid in identifying high-risk carotid artery plaques before they cause stroke and when they can be properly treated to prevent stroke from occurring in the future. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because the discovery of novel and treatable vascular risk factors will ultimately improve risk factor screening and stroke prevention efforts, thereby reducing the incidence of a disabling and lethal disease. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NHLBI's mission that involves reducing the burden of vascular disease by fostering research on prevention.",A Machine Learning Approach For CTA-based Plaque Characterization and Stroke Risk Prediction in Carotid Artery Atherosclerosis,9655181,R21HL145427,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Carotid Endarterectomy', 'Carotid Stenosis', 'Carotid stent', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Ischemia', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Statistical Models', 'Stenosis', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Ulcer', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'calcification', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'stroke risk', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'vascular risk factor']",NHLBI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2019,121619,227555357,0.28282739711447946
"Automatic Quantification and Labeling of Cerebral Microbleeds, Oxygen Saturation and Sources of Abnormal Susceptibility ABSTRACT The detection, localization and quantification of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) plays an important role in diagnosing and establishing appropriate treatment plans in neurodegenerative diseases specifically in vascular dementia (VaD). To date, evaluating CMBs is time consuming, inaccurate and sometimes not possible. We propose to mitigate these problems by developing our software, “qSPIN”, that will provide fast and easy-to-use methods for: 1) automatic identification of CMBs and veins, 2) automatic quantification of CMBs, 3) automatic quantification of oxygen saturation in veins, and 4) creation of a user-friendly software for the practicing radiologist. Recent developments in MRI have provided a new means by which to study the role of CMBs and venous abnormalities in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), VaD, stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) has proven to be a powerful tool by which to detect CMBs and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) can be used to measure changes in oxygen saturation. Knowing how many CMBs there are can predict the onset of VaD, determine whether anti-platelet therapy in stroke should be used, and correlate with neuropsychological outcome for patients with TBI. Our recent version of multi-echo SWI makes it possible to obtain both an arteriogram and a venogram simultaneously. Oxygen saturation can also be used to monitor perfusion changes and extend the window of treatment in stroke.  Currently, most radiologists and technologists do not have time to perform such detailed quantitative processing and thus it is not being done clinically. Our qSPIN software will provide this quantitative data. With the number, size, and location of CMBs or venous abnormalities, a better diagnosis would be possible. Our group is uniquely positioned to address this problem having developed many of these techniques. The novelty of our approach is the marriage of SWI, QSM, STAGE and deep learning techniques to detect these vascular and functional abnormalities. To accomplish the goals of this proposal, we will develop user friendly software that incorporates all imaging information from SWI and QSM to label CMBs. We will also provide the location of the CMBs in Talairach coordinates using a template dataset. In the end, we will have a complete picture of the prevalence of CMBs, abnormal oxygen saturation and their locations in patients with neurodegenerative disease that will improve diagnosis and potentially change their treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is a huge demand today for a comprehensive analysis of diseases with cerebral microbleeds, abnormal oxygen saturation and thrombosis such as vascular dementia. The quantification of these features will have major ramifications for the diagnosis and treatment of dementia as well hypertension, stroke and traumatic brain injury all of which can lead to dementia. Therefore, our major objective in this application is to design and develop advanced image processing software that can rapidly and accurately identify and quantify the presence of cerebral microbleeds and changes in oxygen saturation in dementia and related diseases.","Automatic Quantification and Labeling of Cerebral Microbleeds, Oxygen Saturation and Sources of Abnormal Susceptibility",9845173,R44HL145826,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Arteriogram', 'Arteriosclerosis', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Businesses', 'Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse Axonal Injury', 'Disease', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Infarction', 'Iron', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Maps', 'Marriage', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Published Comment', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stroke', 'TBI Patients', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Veins', 'Venous', 'base', 'cerebral microbleeds', 'cerebral vein', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast imaging', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurovascular', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'stroke risk', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'user friendly software']",NHLBI,"MAGNETIC RESONANCE INNOVATIONS, INC.",R44,2019,214510,667050,0.0879587972976856
"Fast and Easy Assessment of Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this study is to develop an objective tool for the fast and easy assessment of stroke, by developing a novel analytics platform that quickly identifies potential stroke from movement signatures captured with wearable sensors. The tool uses unobtrusive wearable sensors and does not require medical training to operate, and thus will be valuable for families and caregivers of older Americans with high stroke risk who are either living at home or in an assisted living facility. Ischemic stroke affects nearly 700,000 Americans each year, costs approximately $33 billion annually, and is the fifth leading cause of death and a leading cause of disability in the US. IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been an FDA approved therapy for ischemic stroke since 1995, yet only 5-10% of eligible patients receive this therapy. Arrival time in the emergency room (ER) after initial stroke symptoms is directly associated with better outcomes after tPA and endovascular therapy, specifically 4.5 hours and up to 24 hours in select patients, respectively. It is well established that treatment with tPA decreases the lifetime cost of stroke to third party payers by $25,000 per patient. As a result, health plans will be the ultimate economic buyer for this new technology. Here, we are not developing a new therapy for stroke, where so many others have failed. We seek, rather, to fill a well-accepted and clear gap for stroke patients: the early recognition of stroke symptoms that prevents them from accessing PROVEN but time dependent treatments in stroke, whose impact on outcomes is well established. Early identification of symptoms and timely treatment is the single most important determinant of outcomes in ischemic stroke. However, despite massive public health campaigns, most people do not identify stroke symptoms, resulting in costly delays in calling 9-1-1 and patients arriving in the hospital too late to benefit from ischemic stroke treatments. This is a growing problem, given the aging US population of which a significant portion lives at home alone, the staffing crisis at assisted living and nursing facilities, and the prevalence of stroke which is expected to increase by 20% by 2030. Given these trends, administrators and aging experts are increasingly recognizing the value of remote monitoring and aging in place initiatives. Thus, there a clear and urgent, unmet need for a method to assist untrained stroke victims, their families and caregivers in the early recognition of stroke. Bridging this gap with a fast, easy and objective solution would have significant public health impact, because millions of patients could access therapies in a window that is already known to improve outcomes for brain injury. To address this problem, we have leveraged our team’s unique expertise in stroke neurology and developed a set of activation tasks coupled with a wearable solution to assess and quantify ischemic stroke. Once deployed, our solution will improve stroke emergency response and increase the number of patients receiving IV tPA and other reperfusion therapies in the acute setting. NARRATIVE Ischemic stroke affects nearly 700,000 Americans, costs approximately $33 billion annually, and is the fifth leading cause of death and a leading cause of disability in the US. Though treatment for stroke has been available for over 20 years, only a very small number of eligible patients receive it because individuals who have suffered a stroke do not reach the emergency room in time. We have developed a method for quick, easy, real-time assessment for stroke, which will dramatically improve the number of patients receiving timely therapy after stroke and improve the outcome for stroke.",Fast and Easy Assessment of Stroke,9847511,R43NS110338,"['Accelerometer', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alteplase', 'American', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Early identification', 'Economics', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Emergency response', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Campaign', 'Health care facility', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Innovation Corps', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Limb structure', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurologist', 'Nurses', 'Oranges', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physician Executives', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Third-Party Payer', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aging in place', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'disability', 'health plan', 'healthy volunteer', 'hemiparesis', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'life time cost', 'motor impairment', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phase 1 study', 'post stroke', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'sex', 'societal costs', 'standard of care', 'stroke neurology', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'stroke risk', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke symptom', 'stroke therapy', 'stroke victims', 'tool', 'trend', 'volunteer', 'wearable device']",NINDS,"ALVA HEALTH, INC.",R43,2019,256988,0,0.3932201466431412
"Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) Nearly 800,000 people in the United States (US) each year are affected by stroke, which remains the leading cause of adult disability and 5th leading cause of death. Despite the proliferation of stroke centers nationwide, access to timely stroke care and evidence-based therapies is still poor with multiple inefficiencies, redundancies, errors, and system-based barriers that lead to care fragmentation. A stroke system of care that integrates and coordinates care between non-stroke center hospitals, primary stroke centers, and comprehensive stroke centers has been recommended since it would reduce stroke-related deaths by 20,000 annually in the US and nearly 400,000 worldwide. This proposal is significant because it addresses two important gaps in knowledge about the acute evaluation and treatment of stroke patients: prehospital screening errors and delays in inter-hospital transfer. The Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) study will (1) enhance existing LVO screening tools, assess whether machine learning approaches improve LVO prediction, and evaluate the impact of an Enhanced LVO Screening Tool in the prehospital setting; and (2) use learning collaboratives and simulations to design, implement, and pilot test a new inter-hospital stroke transfer protocol. We bring together systems engineers and stroke health service researchers in a novel collaboration that will produce generalizable knowledge that can be widely applied to other urban regions of the country and provide preliminary data and demonstration of novel approaches that could be evaluated in large-scale comparative effectiveness studies across multiple regions.

"Longitudinal and quantitative MR plaque imaging for prediction of response to medical management in symptomatic intracranial atherosclerosis ABSTRACT Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is one of the most common causes of ischemic stroke worldwide. Despite intensive medical management, the current standard of care for secondary stroke prevention, the rate of recurrent stroke is 13% in the first year and as high as 35% in certain populations by 2 years. Currently, the initial and follow-up evaluations of these patients rely exclusively on assessments of clinical risk factors and, in some circumstances, the degree of luminal stenosis on imaging. However, this strategy may overlook subtle non-luminal changes within ICAD lesions. A tool that can directly probe atherosclerotic plaques and accurately quantify longitudinal changes of plaque features may help early identify non-responsive patients in whom an alternative therapy can be initiated. Magnetic resonance (MR) vessel wall imaging (VWI) has the potential to fulfill this role because of its compacity to directly visualize the vessel wall and characterize plaque features. However, there are several technical challenges associated with intracranial VWI: small size, tortuous course, and deep sitting warrant a high-resolution and 3D imaging approach; multiple lesion sites require a large imaging view; signals arising from neighboring blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) need to be adequately suppressed; relatively long imaging time and potential image corruption by patient motion; and lack of dedicated plaque analysis tools particularly for 3D dataset. In this proposal, we will develop a reliable 3D VWI- based MR plaque imaging (MRPI) strategy for prediction of response to medical management in symptomatic ICAD. Specifically, we will first develop a whole-brain 3D VWI sequence with intracranial vessel-dedicated motion compensation and motion-adaptive imaging acceleration (Aim1-Task1) and develop an automated intracranial vessel wall (IVA) tool integrating 3D vessel wall segmentation and computational algorithms for deriving quantitative plaque features (Aim1-Task2) followed by a validation study (Aim1-Task3). The validated techniques will then be used in a cross-sectional study to determine the MRPI-derived quantitative plaque features that are associated with ICAD lesions within the infarcted territory in patients with acute symptomatic ICAD (Aim 2). We will finally conduct a longitudinal study to determine the capacity of longitudinal and quantitative MRPI to predict response to medical management in symptomatic ICAD patients (Aim 3). Successful completion of the project will validate the compacity of VWI-based MRPI to quantitatively characterize ICAD and predict response to medical management in symptomatic ICAD patients. This will open the door to future clinical trials investigating the role of MRPI in developing personalized management paradigms and assessing new therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atherosclerosis in the brain is an important cause of ischemic stroke worldwide and carries a high risk of recurrent stroke despite treatment.

"A Machine Learning Approach to Classifying Time Since Stroke using Medical Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) is the dominant and most proven treatment option, but its use is only indicated within 4.5 hours following a stroke. Unfortunately, up to 30% of stroke patients present with an unknown time since stroke (TSS) symptom onset, which makes them ineligible to receive IV tPA. Many of these individuals could be spared severe morbidity or mortality if there existed an alternative method for establishing TSS, allowing them to be identified and treated. This proposal will develop machine learning methods to create a physiologically grounded method for predicting TSS based on multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) imaging data. We believe our proposed techniques will outperform state-of-the-art methods that are based on subjective image interpretation, and have the potential to provide an objective data point that may be used in conjunction with the subjective assessments of experts, or in clinical environments that lack expertise in stroke imaging Research has established that MR and CT imaging captures information that correlates with TSS. However, existing methods for extracting this information are based on a physician subjectively interpreting the images and delineating regions of interest, processes that have been documented to have only weak to moderate agreement across trained expert reviewers. An automated approach that comprehensively analyzes the spectrum of imaging data could identify complex relationships across channels that more accurately classify TSS. For example, in MR, diffusion-weighted, perfusion-weighted, and fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging all play important roles in characterizing a stroke, but a deep understanding of how each channel may be combined to describe TSS is unknown. We propose to establish new deep learning methods for fusing this information. Specifically, we will: 1) develop a machine learning framework for classifying TSS; 2) develop a deep convolutional autoencoder to generate novel multimodal image representations from MR and CT to improve classification; and 3) implement visualization techniques that elucidate the relationship between deep features and pathophysiological stroke processes. Under this project, we will use data from the UCLA and UCI Stroke Centers, allowing us to study different patient populations and imaging techniques. The successful completion of this research will provide a new method for estimating TSS from imaging, leading to new prospective trials for providing therapy to patients with unknown TSS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year; however patients who present with an unknown stroke onset time are ineli- gible for receiving the leading therapy.

"Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data It is a common clinical occurrence that neuroimaging scans obtained in the course of routine clinical care discover a prior brain infarction in patients with no history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Indeed, epidemiologic studies indicate that silent brain infarctions (SBI) are far more common than strokes; MRI- defined SBI can be detected in ~20% of the healthy elderly. In these studies based on screened patients, the findings have been shown to be associated with subtle, typically unrecognized, deficits in physical and cognitive function. These imaging findings are also strong, independent risk factors for future stroke and dementia. Despite the very high prevalence of SBI in screened populations, and their serious consequences, little is known about the significance or the appropriate management of SBI when discovered incidentally in routine care. While there is strong evidence that antiplatelet therapy and statin therapy are effective in preventing recurrent stroke in patients with prior stroke, the degree to which these results apply to patients with SBI is unclear. Because patients with SBI define a population that falls in between primary and secondary stroke prevention, the approach to these patients is marked by uncertainty and practice variation, making it an ideal condition for observational comparative effectiveness research. Nonetheless, there are serious challenges for the study of SBI. As patients have no overt symptoms, recruitment into a trial can be problematic. Comparative effectiveness research on SBI, using routinely collected data and leveraging the variation in care of these patients, is impeded by the fact that there are no ICD codes for SBI, and it is generally not included in structured fields of electronic health records (EHR) as it is typically considered an incidental finding. In order to establish the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies for SBI in a large, heterogeneous population, we propose to develop Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to identify individuals with SBI through the automated review of neuroradiology reports. We have performed preliminary work to demonstrate that such an approach is feasible. We will then apply state-of-the-science observational comparative effectiveness methods in a massive database with linked EHR and claims data to examine the effectiveness of statins and antiplatelet agents in preventing future stroke and dementia. Thus, our aims are: Aim 1: We will develop NLP algorithms that can accurately identify cases of SBI and white matter disease (WMD) in two different health systems. Aim 2: We will port, refine, and validate the NLP algorithm in a large heterogeneous database including more than 600 hospitals and 6500 clinics and identify a large cohort of patients with routinely-discovered SBI and WMD. Aim 3: We will characterize the cohort with respect to age- specific prevalence of SBI, management patterns, and the risk of future stroke and dementia associated with SBI and WMD. Aim 4: We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of preventive therapies (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally-discovered SBI. The goal of this project is to improve the evidence base for the prevention of stroke in patients with “silent brain infarct”—i.e., a stroke on neuroimaging (head CT or MRI) but no clinical evidence of a stroke. We will develop a computer-based algorithm using a technology known as natural language processing that can accurately identify cases of silent brain infarction among a large population of adults on whom neuroimages have been obtained, but who are without a history of clinically-evident cerebrovascular disease. We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of medications (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally discovered and reported SBI.",Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data,9726113,R01NS102233,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'American Stroke Association', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Infarction', 'Caring', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention approach', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive therapy', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'White Matter Disease', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'case finding', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'effectiveness research', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'falls', 'improved', 'learning progression', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient screening', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'repository', 'routine care', 'screening', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,531215,17640378,0.273588154439618
"Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are critical to identify because prevention therapy can reduce the risk of future vascular events by > 50%. Diagnostic testing and therapeutic intervention must start as soon as possible because 10-25% of TIAs have a stroke within 90 days. Because so many patients present emergently with transient neurological events the large majority of whom do not go on to have a stroke, methods for identifying TIAs at high risk for stroke have been sought so that work up and treatment can be targeted to those who need it most to save time, money and limited resources. Though the ABCD2 score and brain Diffusion Weighted Imaging-MRI (DWI-MRI) have improved prediction of which TIAs have a stroke, their sensitivity and specificity for prediction of individual cases i poor. In this proposal we propose that peripheral blood leukocytes and platelets play pivotal roles in which TIAs go on to have a stroke and by assessing RNA in whole blood we can evaluate leukocyte and platelet function in TIA patients who go on to have stroke versus those that do not have a stroke. We hypothesize that specific coagulation and immune genes are activated in TIA patients that predispose them to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIA patients who do NOT have a stroke by 90 days. A subset of these leukocyte and platelet mRNA genes will predict TIAs who have a stroke by 90 days. This hypothesis is addressed by the following specific aims. Aim #1 (Derivation Cohort): Demonstrate that mRNA expression measured using RNAseq from whole blood differs in a derivation cohort of TIAs that go on to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIAs who do not have a stroke by 90 days. Demonstrate that most mRNA found to be regulated using RNAseq are also significantly regulated when measured using qRT-PCR. Aim #2 (Derivation Cohort): Apply machine learning algorithms to the mRNA from Aim #1 to derive an optimal subset of mRNA regulated by both RNAseq and qRT-PCR that predict which TIAs have strokes by 90 days compared to those who do not with >95% sensitivity on cross-validation. Aim #3 (Validation Cohort): Use machine/prediction learning algorithms to demonstrate that the genes from Aim #2 when measured using qRT-PCR on an independent validation cohort predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days with >85% sensitivity. The goal of these studies is to discover mRNA profiles in blood that predict which TIA patients go on to have strokes by 90 days. When confirmed in future studies, this will direct in depth testing to those high risk TIAs most in need in order to prevent strokes, and decrease unnecessary testing in those with low risk of stroke. Equally as important, the genes discovered to be associated with high risk of stroke in TIA patients will represent potential novel stroke prevention targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine RNA in blood using RNAseq and qRT-PCR of human subjects with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) who have a stroke by 90 days compared to TIAs who do not have a stroke. The regulated mRNA, exons and alternatively spliced transcripts in a Derivation Cohort of TIA patients will be used to predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days in a Validation Cohort of TIA patients.",Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs),9650647,R01NS097000,"['Address', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Labyrinthine disorder', 'Leukocytes', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Migraine', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prevention therapy', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA', 'ROC Curve', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'cohort', 'emergency settings', 'gene discovery', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'mRNA Expression', 'machine learning algorithm', 'monocyte', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'platelet function', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'release factor', 'stroke risk', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2019,552408,254622553,0.38851526230826955
"Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and a leading cause of death in the US, and results in $21 billion in direct medical costs each year. Stroke disproportionately impacts minorities including Hispanics who have higher stroke risk, poorer outcomes after stroke, and a higher prevalence of post-stroke sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Declining stroke mortality in combination with the aging US population will result in dramatic increases in the number of disabled stroke survivors, with the largest increases projected among Hispanics. New approaches to improve stroke outcomes are therefore urgently needed, and may be particularly important among Hispanics, the largest US minority population. One critical yet scarcely explored opportunity may exist through identification and treatment of SDB in individuals with stroke. SDB is highly prevalent after stroke, and its presence predicts poor functional outcome and higher mortality. Nonetheless, very few stroke patients are screened or treated for SDB. Little information is available about which patients are likely to have high risk SDB after stroke; the trajectory of SDB in this setting and how to predict it; and almost no data are available for Hispanics. This information may offer opportunities to improve critical post-stroke outcomes and lessen ethnic stroke disparities. Thus, the main goals of the research proposed are 1) develop risk stratification models for post-stroke patients with SDB, 2) provide novel insight into the trajectory that SDB takes after stroke to inform management decisions, 3) inform the design of a subsequent clinical trial that will assess the impact of treatment of high risk SDB on key post-stroke outcomes, and 4) explore a possible treatable cause for worse stroke outcomes in Hispanics. We plan to take advantage of an exceptional opportunity provided by the ongoing Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project (R01 NS38916). In this population-based stroke surveillance study in a bi-ethnic community, all acute ischemic stroke patients are interviewed at baseline and followed prospectively for 3, 6 and 12 month outcomes. The current application will add longitudinal SDB assessments to BASIC using a validated portable SDB screening device. SDB severity will be assessed with the apnea/hypopnea index, as well as innovative measures derived from signal analysis. Use of BASIC provides a cost-effective opportunity to expand our knowledge about SDB after stroke in ways that can directly impact clinical care, future clinical trial design, and health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), which affects over half of stroke patients, predicts poor outcomes after stroke. Leveraging the infrastructure of the BASIC project, we propose a longitudinal, population-based study of SDB and stroke outcomes to improve the identification and management of important SDB after stroke, provide critical data to plan future clinical trials, and explore a potential target to reduce an important ethnic health disparity.",Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment,9609472,R01HL126700,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Apnea', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elements', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Neurological outcome', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Pulse Rates', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disability', 'ethnic health disparity', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient screening', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'portability', 'post stroke', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'stroke risk', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke trials', 'surveillance study']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,739858,641965656,0.40221317730074
"Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke Project Summary / Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the world’s most common serious heart rhythm problem and causes 15% of all strokes, a major cause of disability and death among Americans. Long-term monitoring for early AF detection and treatment is recommended for many stroke patients, but although existing cardiac monitors are accurate, they suffer from methodologic and cost limitations that preclude their long-term use. In the proposed, “Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation Real-Time in Stroke,” Study, our overall objective is to enhance paroxysmal AF (pAF) detection by enhancing and testing Pulsewatch, an innovative, smartwatch-based technology for long-term rhythm monitoring of stroke patients. For Aim 1, we embed our state-of-the art AF detection algorithms, interactive messaging to promote adherence, and novel contact and motion noise correction capabilities into a smartwatch to enable near-continuous pulse waveform analysis. We will further refine Pulsewatch through focus groups and a Hack-a-thon with stroke patients and their medical providers. For Aim 2, we will enroll 90 stroke survivors and provide them with a smartphone and smartwatch, both encoded with Pulsewatch. We will compare the performance of Pulsewatch when worn daily for 7 days to conventional 7-day cardiac monitoring for pAF detection. For Aim 3, we will determine the acceptability and usability of Pulsewatch through follow-up interviews and focus groups in 30 randomly selected participants from Aim 2 asked to continue wearing smartwatch daily for an additional 30 days. We will identify patient factors associated with adherence and evaluate the impact of Pulsewatch use on disease-specific quality of life, anxiety, and self- activation among the 30 users compared to 30 stroke patients treated with usual care through baseline and 1- month assessments. Our research will lead to the development of a highly acceptable, enabling cardiovascular monitoring technology designed by, and for, stroke patients that facilitates long-term non-invasive screening for pAF, as well as communication between stroke patients and their medical providers.

Accordingly, we propose a series of prospective investigations involving stroke patients and their medical providers focused on developing, validating, and field-testing a new smartwatch-based AF detection platform, Pulsewatch, to create a mobile technology that can detect paroxysms of AF, accelerate their treatment, is user-centric, and is of great intrinsic acceptability.",Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke,9679513,R01HL137734,"['Adherence', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Mail', 'Engineering', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fingers', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart Rate', 'Immigrant', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Market Research', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Representative', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Self Efficacy', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spottings', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cryptogenic stroke', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'heart rhythm', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'iterative design', 'lens', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'post stroke', 'preference', 'prospective', 'screening', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'smart watch', 'smartphone Application', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'usability']",NHLBI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2019,740058,294146927,0.2670392199258643
"Detecting bleeding events using EHRs for prediction in Afib Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects millions of mostly older Americans. Atrial fibrillation contributes to stroke and weighing stroke risk against risk of bleeding from oral anticoagulants (AC) is central to AF management. AC decision-making has become more complex in recent years with the introduction of several target specific oral AC agents. It remains challenging to advise older AF patients about AC since they are frequently at high risk for stroke and complications from AC, particularly bleeding, and data are limited on real-world outcomes of AC among vulnerable populations. Our project, Detecting bleeding Events using Electronic records for Prediction in Atrial Fibrillation (DEEP AF), will leverage novel biomedical natural language processing (NLP) approaches to integrate bleeding-related information from both the structured and unstructured EHR records and statistical and deep learning approaches to predict risk of bleeding on AF patients on AC therapy. DEEP AF will address present knowledge gaps to accurately identify bleeding events from longitudinal electronic health records and to improve bleeding prediction accuracy and focus on modifiable, clinically relevant risk factors, thereby facilitating future large-scale comparative effectiveness studies evaluating AC agents, and helping clinicians develop better approaches to weighing AC risks and benefits.

"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.            Subproject-1    Modeling treated recovery from aphasia    Lead Investigator: Julius Fridriksson, Ph.D.            DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of serious adult disability in the United States. One of the most devastating impairments resulting from stroke is aphasia, a language impairment caused by left hemisphere damage involving cortical language areas. It is generally accepted that behavioral aphasia treatment is effective. Nevertheless, different patients experience very different degrees of benefit from aphasia treatment. Despite considerable differences in the response to aphasia treatment, the relationship between patient factors and treatment response is poorly understood and very few reliable prognostic indicators have been identified. This is a major problem, as both time and resources are wasted when clinicians do not know what patients are likely to respond to treatment, or which treatment best fits individual patients. The purpose of the current project is to develop a model that includes biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors to predict patients' response to aphasia treatment. Aphasia severity is one of the few factors that have been identified as a reliable predictor of performance in treatment; it is generally accepted that more severe aphasia is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. However, aphasia severity is a multidimensional construct and patients with similar overall severity scores might demonstrate very different language impairment profiles. To better understand how language impairment relates to treatment outcomes, the dual stream model (DS model;1) will be consulted. Specifically, we will test whether measures of proportional damage to the cortical areas that comprise the DS model improve prediction of aphasia treatment response, beyond biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors. Although the DS model is a functional model grounded in neuroanatomy, we expect measures of speech and language that assesses processes supported by the two major components of the DS model - the dorsal and ventral streams - might be redundant with measures of cortical damage. To understand whether our predictive model can be generalized across different kinds of treatment foci, each patient will undergo treatment devoted to phonological stimulation and a separate treatment phase focusing on semantic stimulation. Ultimately, the goal here is to construct a predictive model that will be made available on- line so that clinicians can enter test scores from individual patients to predic how likely a given patient is to respond to treatment, as well as the focus of that treatment.         There is a great need for prognostic indicators of aphasia treatment response. At the completion of our research, we will understand why some patients respond better to aphasia treatment than others. We have selected treatment approaches that are routinely used in clinical practice, allowing for immediate translation of the findings directly into patient management. The current project will yield a vast dataset that will be made publicly available allowing others to study further aphasia treatment response in relation to cognitive/linguistic and lesion factors.              ",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),9674421,P50DC014664,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biography', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dorsal', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Employment', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'behavior test', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'fitness', 'hemisphere damage', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'phonology', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2019,2193618,45219910,0.17149440120445703
"Prediction Model for Incident Stroke for Early Screening of an Individual at Risk of Stroke ABSTRACT Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States and other developed countries. About 800,000 people in the United States have a stroke each year. The incidence of stroke is expected to increase (due to diabetes, an aging population and a rise in obesity), which is a major public health concern and great economic burden to society. Early identification of people at risk of stroke is important as it allows for better planning and implementation of preventative strategies. A number of risk prediction models have been proposed for stroke using common biomarkers such as lipids, and conventional risk factors including age, gender, history of hypertension and smoking. However, these models do not adequately capture a substantial proportion of persons at high risk of stroke they lack precision (best accuracy is up to 50% by Framingham risk score) in risk estimation and have other limitations. Therefore, it is a necessity to improve the accuracy of a stroke risk prediction model. Therefore, we aim to develop a novel model using retinal vessel features and conventional risk factors which will provide higher accuracy on stroke prediction than the existing models and provide better preventative strategies for the people at risk of stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the risk of stroke. Hence, identification of patients at risk of incident stroke is critically needed to help prevent this life-threatening disease. To achieve this goal, we propose to develop an automated screening system that can be widely deployed to identify these individuals at risk of stroke.",Prediction Model for Incident Stroke for Early Screening of an Individual at Risk of Stroke,9753419,R43NS102100,"['Age', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'American', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Asians', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Body mass index', 'Brain imaging', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Educational Background', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Hispanics', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Lesion', 'Licensing', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurologist', 'Obesity', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reflex action', 'Reporting', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Veins', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Width', 'aging population', 'base', 'checkup examination', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disability', 'early screening', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'platform-independent', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'racial and ethnic', 'retina blood vessel structure', 'retinal imaging', 'screening', 'stroke incidence', 'stroke risk', 'white matter']",NINDS,"IHEALTHSCREEN, INC.",R43,2018,45747,585067,0.35257871588316464
"Data-driven subtyping to find patients with drug interactions leading to stroke Project Summary Stroke is a highly heterogeneous and complex disease and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Identification of the cause of disease is essential for risk stratification and optimal treatment, but can be difficult, as up to 35% of causes are undetermined by traditional subtyping criteria and very few causative genetic variants have been found. In addition, certain causes may be hidden within the clinical picture of a patient, such as an adverse drug reaction. Using data-driven approaches to analyze the medical records of patients may uncover novel patterns of risk factors and clinical features leading to stroke. The long-term goal of this research is to identify novel subtypes of highly heterogeneous diseases such as stroke and to reduce the genetic heterogeneity of a disease cohort by identifying patients with the same subtype. The objective of this application is to propose a pipeline that applies a data-driven analysis of medical notes to identify novel subtypes of stroke, focus on a subtype caused by an adverse drug reaction or drug pair interaction, validate the subtype in a genotyped study cohort, and look for gene variant enrichment in this cohort. This application’s central hypothesis is that applying deep learning to the electronic health record (EHR) of acute ischemic stroke patients will form subtypes based on more granular information than currently implemented and with reduced genetic heterogeneity by identifying novel patterns of risk factors and clinical picture leading to the stroke. In addition, we hypothesize that at least one subtype will identify patients whose stroke is an adverse drug reaction or drug-drug interaction. To do this, Aim 1 will first identify all acute ischemic stroke patients in the EHR by developing a machine learning classifier trained on structured data in the EHR. Aim 2 will then build and train an unsupervised deep learning algorithm on text from medical notes to identify clusters, or subtypes, of patients with similar clinical pictures. Aim 3 will finally validate reduction in genetic heterogeneity of these cohorts by estimating observational heritability of all subtypes using a tool created in our lab and comparing this with the heritability estimates of subtypes derived from physician-based criteria. It will also focus on a not well-studied subtype, stroke due to an adverse drug reaction or drug-drug interaction, by identifying its enrichment in the novel subtypes, validating this subtype in a study cohort with genotyped data, and finally looking for enrichment of pharmacogenetic variants in this subtype. These aims will generate a computational pipeline that identifies novel subtypes of acute ischemic stroke, enabling improved future genetic studies by reducing genetic heterogeneity of cohorts and improved understanding of the underlying causes of the disease. Project Narrative Stroke is a highly complex disease that is a leading cause of death and severe disability. Identifying the cause of stroke is essential for risk stratification and optimal treatment, but up to a third of cases are of undetermined cause, and very few genetic variants have been identified due to the heterogeneity of the disease. To address this, this research proposal develops a computational pipeline that applies data-driven deep learning to medical notes to identify novel combinations of environmental, genetic, and medical risk factors causing the disease; this tool may clarify the etiology of unknown stroke cases, provide cohorts of patients enriched with similar genetic variants, and be expanded to subtype any disease.",Data-driven subtyping to find patients with drug interactions leading to stroke,9469853,F30HL140946,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heritability', 'Internet', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease heterogeneity', 'experience', 'falls', 'forest', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'population based', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F30,2018,49524,558628098,0.24130024486329532
"Prediction Model for Incident Stroke for Early Screening of an Individual at Risk of Stroke ABSTRACT Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States and other developed countries. About 800,000 people in the United States have a stroke each year. The incidence of stroke is expected to increase (due to diabetes, an aging population and a rise in obesity), which is a major public health concern and great economic burden to society. Early identification of people at risk of stroke is important as it allows for better planning and implementation of preventative strategies. A number of risk prediction models have been proposed for stroke using common biomarkers such as lipids, and conventional risk factors including age, gender, history of hypertension and smoking. However, these models do not adequately capture a substantial proportion of persons at high risk of stroke they lack precision (best accuracy is up to 50% by Framingham risk score) in risk estimation and have other limitations. Therefore, it is a necessity to improve the accuracy of a stroke risk prediction model. Therefore, we aim to develop a novel model using retinal vessel features and conventional risk factors which will provide higher accuracy on stroke prediction than the existing models and provide better preventative strategies for the people at risk of stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the risk of stroke. Hence, identification of patients at risk of incident stroke is critically needed to help prevent this life-threatening disease. To achieve this goal, we propose to develop an automated screening system that can be widely deployed to identify these individuals at risk of stroke.",Prediction Model for Incident Stroke for Early Screening of an Individual at Risk of Stroke,9658923,R43NS102100,"['Age', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'American', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Asians', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Body mass index', 'Brain imaging', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Educational Background', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Hispanics', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Lesion', 'Licensing', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurologist', 'Obesity', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reflex action', 'Reporting', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Veins', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Width', 'aging population', 'base', 'checkup examination', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disability', 'early screening', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'platform-independent', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'racial and ethnic', 'retina blood vessel structure', 'retinal imaging', 'screening', 'stroke incidence', 'stroke risk', 'white matter']",NINDS,"IHEALTHSCREEN, INC.",R43,2018,50000,585067,0.35257871588316464
"Prehospital and Emergency Room Stroke Diagnosis Using Quantitative Cerebral Hemodynamics Large vessel acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is the leading cause of disability and fourth leading cause of death with approximately 250,000 per year in the United States alone. Although treatments including interventional (stentriever) and pharmaceutical (tPA) exist for large vessel occlusion (LVO), there is not a rapid prehospital tool for diagnoses which guides the use of the correct therapy. Because the time to treatment for stroke is critical, there is a large need for a device which can be used in ambulances and other prehospital environments so that patients are rapidly provided the correct care. Currently, computed tomography angiography (CTA) imaging is the standard of care but its use is limited to the hospital or in some cases multimillion dollar stroke on wheels ambulances which are not practical. There is a significant delay that occurs between stroke onset and diagnosis by the time CTA is performed and read resulting in unnecessary death or disability. More delay occurs when patients need to be transferred to a stroke center because the hospital they are at does not perform interventional therapy. Rapid diagnosis in a prehospital setting will enable patients to be taken to the correct hospital and provide LVO location to surgeons in the operating suite.  As the critical factor affecting cerebral anatomy in AIS patients is the limitation of blood flow to the brain the most likely technology to assist in diagnosis of LVO is one that can measure flow directly. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) has been used to directly measure blood flow velocity since 1982 but it relies on a trained operator skilled in both finding the affected vessel as well as interpreting a complicated waveform. Guidelines already exist for how to diagnose LVO with TCD and hospitals with a trained operator currently use it. However, it’s not used in smaller hospitals, urgent care or ambulance settings due to the training requirements.  This work will revolutionize TCD for stroke diagnosis because it removes the need for a trained operator; key for mass adoption of the technology. TCD is already small and portable so it can easily fit in an ambulance similar in size to an automated external defibrillator. This work will use machine learning techniques we have developed to analyze the morphology of TCD waveforms and provide diagnosis information. The key is the ability to remove the operator variability by understanding how waveform morphology of stroke changes based on depth relative to occlusion so that the need to measure in a precise location is eliminated. Our preliminary results show 95% accuracy for LVO diagnosis but we need to broaden our dataset while updating our algorithms. Phase I will use our FDA Cleared Lucid M1 Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound System to measure confirmed stroke subjects after CTA imaging and update our algorithm. Phase II will use algorithms developed in Phase I with a fully automated TCD system we have developed with investor funding that does not require an operator or trained sonographer. We currently have Western IRB approval and are upgrading usability features of the device for ease of use with minimal training. Large vessel acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is the leading cause of disability and fourth leading cause of death with approximately 250,000 per year in the United States alone. This work will reduce the time to treatment for stroke by developing necessary algorithms to diagnose AIS with a portable ultrasound technology which measures cerebral blood flow velocity.

"Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) Nearly 800,000 people in the United States (US) each year are affected by stroke, which remains the leading cause of adult disability and 5th leading cause of death. Despite the proliferation of stroke centers nationwide, access to timely stroke care and evidence-based therapies is still poor with multiple inefficiencies, redundancies, errors, and system-based barriers that lead to care fragmentation. A stroke system of care that integrates and coordinates care between non-stroke center hospitals, primary stroke centers, and comprehensive stroke centers has been recommended since it would reduce stroke-related deaths by 20,000 annually in the US and nearly 400,000 worldwide. This proposal is significant because it addresses two important gaps in knowledge about the acute evaluation and treatment of stroke patients: prehospital screening errors and delays in inter-hospital transfer. The Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) study will (1) enhance existing LVO screening tools, assess whether machine learning approaches improve LVO prediction, and evaluate the impact of an Enhanced LVO Screening Tool in the prehospital setting; and (2) use learning collaboratives and simulations to design, implement, and pilot test a new inter-hospital stroke transfer protocol. We bring together systems engineers and stroke health service researchers in a novel collaboration that will produce generalizable knowledge that can be widely applied to other urban regions of the country and provide preliminary data and demonstration of novel approaches that could be evaluated in large-scale comparative effectiveness studies across multiple regions. NARRATIVE Timely acute stroke treatments can be life-saving and reduce disability from stroke; however, a minority of patients receive these treatments in a timely manner or at all.

"A Machine Learning Approach to Classifying Time Since Stroke using Medical Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) is the dominant and most proven treatment option, but its use is only indicated within 4.5 hours following a stroke. Unfortunately, up to 30% of stroke patients present with an unknown time since stroke (TSS) symptom onset, which makes them ineligible to receive IV tPA. Many of these individuals could be spared severe morbidity or mortality if there existed an alternative method for establishing TSS, allowing them to be identified and treated. This proposal will develop machine learning methods to create a physiologically grounded method for predicting TSS based on multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) imaging data. We believe our proposed techniques will outperform state-of-the-art methods that are based on subjective image interpretation, and have the potential to provide an objective data point that may be used in conjunction with the subjective assessments of experts, or in clinical environments that lack expertise in stroke imaging Research has established that MR and CT imaging captures information that correlates with TSS. However, existing methods for extracting this information are based on a physician subjectively interpreting the images and delineating regions of interest, processes that have been documented to have only weak to moderate agreement across trained expert reviewers. An automated approach that comprehensively analyzes the spectrum of imaging data could identify complex relationships across channels that more accurately classify TSS. For example, in MR, diffusion-weighted, perfusion-weighted, and fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging all play important roles in characterizing a stroke, but a deep understanding of how each channel may be combined to describe TSS is unknown. We propose to establish new deep learning methods for fusing this information. Specifically, we will: 1) develop a machine learning framework for classifying TSS; 2) develop a deep convolutional autoencoder to generate novel multimodal image representations from MR and CT to improve classification; and 3) implement visualization techniques that elucidate the relationship between deep features and pathophysiological stroke processes. Under this project, we will use data from the UCLA and UCI Stroke Centers, allowing us to study different patient populations and imaging techniques. The successful completion of this research will provide a new method for estimating TSS from imaging, leading to new prospective trials for providing therapy to patients with unknown TSS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year; however patients who present with an unknown stroke onset time are ineli- gible for receiving the leading therapy.

"Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are critical to identify because prevention therapy can reduce the risk of future vascular events by > 50%. Diagnostic testing and therapeutic intervention must start as soon as possible because 10-25% of TIAs have a stroke within 90 days. Because so many patients present emergently with transient neurological events the large majority of whom do not go on to have a stroke, methods for identifying TIAs at high risk for stroke have been sought so that work up and treatment can be targeted to those who need it most to save time, money and limited resources. Though the ABCD2 score and brain Diffusion Weighted Imaging-MRI (DWI-MRI) have improved prediction of which TIAs have a stroke, their sensitivity and specificity for prediction of individual cases i poor. In this proposal we propose that peripheral blood leukocytes and platelets play pivotal roles in which TIAs go on to have a stroke and by assessing RNA in whole blood we can evaluate leukocyte and platelet function in TIA patients who go on to have stroke versus those that do not have a stroke. We hypothesize that specific coagulation and immune genes are activated in TIA patients that predispose them to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIA patients who do NOT have a stroke by 90 days. A subset of these leukocyte and platelet mRNA genes will predict TIAs who have a stroke by 90 days. This hypothesis is addressed by the following specific aims. Aim #1 (Derivation Cohort): Demonstrate that mRNA expression measured using RNAseq from whole blood differs in a derivation cohort of TIAs that go on to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIAs who do not have a stroke by 90 days. Demonstrate that most mRNA found to be regulated using RNAseq are also significantly regulated when measured using qRT-PCR. Aim #2 (Derivation Cohort): Apply machine learning algorithms to the mRNA from Aim #1 to derive an optimal subset of mRNA regulated by both RNAseq and qRT-PCR that predict which TIAs have strokes by 90 days compared to those who do not with >95% sensitivity on cross-validation. Aim #3 (Validation Cohort): Use machine/prediction learning algorithms to demonstrate that the genes from Aim #2 when measured using qRT-PCR on an independent validation cohort predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days with >85% sensitivity. The goal of these studies is to discover mRNA profiles in blood that predict which TIA patients go on to have strokes by 90 days. When confirmed in future studies, this will direct in depth testing to those high risk TIAs most in need in order to prevent strokes, and decrease unnecessary testing in those with low risk of stroke. Equally as important, the genes discovered to be associated with high risk of stroke in TIA patients will represent potential novel stroke prevention targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine RNA in blood using RNAseq and qRT-PCR of human subjects with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) who have a stroke by 90 days compared to TIAs who do not have a stroke.

"Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data It is a common clinical occurrence that neuroimaging scans obtained in the course of routine clinical care discover a prior brain infarction in patients with no history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Indeed, epidemiologic studies indicate that silent brain infarctions (SBI) are far more common than strokes; MRI- defined SBI can be detected in ~20% of the healthy elderly. In these studies based on screened patients, the findings have been shown to be associated with subtle, typically unrecognized, deficits in physical and cognitive function. These imaging findings are also strong, independent risk factors for future stroke and dementia. Despite the very high prevalence of SBI in screened populations, and their serious consequences, little is known about the significance or the appropriate management of SBI when discovered incidentally in routine care. While there is strong evidence that antiplatelet therapy and statin therapy are effective in preventing recurrent stroke in patients with prior stroke, the degree to which these results apply to patients with SBI is unclear. Because patients with SBI define a population that falls in between primary and secondary stroke prevention, the approach to these patients is marked by uncertainty and practice variation, making it an ideal condition for observational comparative effectiveness research. Nonetheless, there are serious challenges for the study of SBI. As patients have no overt symptoms, recruitment into a trial can be problematic. Comparative effectiveness research on SBI, using routinely collected data and leveraging the variation in care of these patients, is impeded by the fact that there are no ICD codes for SBI, and it is generally not included in structured fields of electronic health records (EHR) as it is typically considered an incidental finding. In order to establish the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies for SBI in a large, heterogeneous population, we propose to develop Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to identify individuals with SBI through the automated review of neuroradiology reports. We have performed preliminary work to demonstrate that such an approach is feasible. We will then apply state-of-the-science observational comparative effectiveness methods in a massive database with linked EHR and claims data to examine the effectiveness of statins and antiplatelet agents in preventing future stroke and dementia. Thus, our aims are: Aim 1: We will develop NLP algorithms that can accurately identify cases of SBI and white matter disease (WMD) in two different health systems. Aim 2: We will port, refine, and validate the NLP algorithm in a large heterogeneous database including more than 600 hospitals and 6500 clinics and identify a large cohort of patients with routinely-discovered SBI and WMD. Aim 3: We will characterize the cohort with respect to age- specific prevalence of SBI, management patterns, and the risk of future stroke and dementia associated with SBI and WMD. Aim 4: We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of preventive therapies (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally-discovered SBI. The goal of this project is to improve the evidence base for the prevention of stroke in patients with “silent brain infarct”—i.e., a stroke on neuroimaging (head CT or MRI) but no clinical evidence of a stroke. We will develop a computer-based algorithm using a technology known as natural language processing that can accurately identify cases of silent brain infarction among a large population of adults on whom neuroimages have been obtained, but who are without a history of clinically-evident cerebrovascular disease. We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of medications (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally discovered and reported SBI.",Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data,9474690,R01NS102233,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'American Stroke Association', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Infarction', 'Caring', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Informatics', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention approach', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive therapy', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'White Matter Disease', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'case finding', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'effectiveness research', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'falls', 'improved', 'learning progression', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient screening', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'repository', 'routine care', 'screening', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,681151,17640378,0.273588154439618
"Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and a leading cause of death in the US, and results in $21 billion in direct medical costs each year. Stroke disproportionately impacts minorities including Hispanics who have higher stroke risk, poorer outcomes after stroke, and a higher prevalence of post-stroke sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Declining stroke mortality in combination with the aging US population will result in dramatic increases in the number of disabled stroke survivors, with the largest increases projected among Hispanics. New approaches to improve stroke outcomes are therefore urgently needed, and may be particularly important among Hispanics, the largest US minority population. One critical yet scarcely explored opportunity may exist through identification and treatment of SDB in individuals with stroke. SDB is highly prevalent after stroke, and its presence predicts poor functional outcome and higher mortality. Nonetheless, very few stroke patients are screened or treated for SDB. Little information is available about which patients are likely to have high risk SDB after stroke; the trajectory of SDB in this setting and how to predict it; and almost no data are available for Hispanics. This information may offer opportunities to improve critical post-stroke outcomes and lessen ethnic stroke disparities. Thus, the main goals of the research proposed are 1) develop risk stratification models for post-stroke patients with SDB, 2) provide novel insight into the trajectory that SDB takes after stroke to inform management decisions, 3) inform the design of a subsequent clinical trial that will assess the impact of treatment of high risk SDB on key post-stroke outcomes, and 4) explore a possible treatable cause for worse stroke outcomes in Hispanics. We plan to take advantage of an exceptional opportunity provided by the ongoing Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project (R01 NS38916). In this population-based stroke surveillance study in a bi-ethnic community, all acute ischemic stroke patients are interviewed at baseline and followed prospectively for 3, 6 and 12 month outcomes. The current application will add longitudinal SDB assessments to BASIC using a validated portable SDB screening device. SDB severity will be assessed with the apnea/hypopnea index, as well as innovative measures derived from signal analysis. Use of BASIC provides a cost-effective opportunity to expand our knowledge about SDB after stroke in ways that can directly impact clinical care, future clinical trial design, and health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), which affects over half of stroke patients, predicts poor outcomes after stroke. Leveraging the infrastructure of the BASIC project, we propose a longitudinal, population-based study of SDB and stroke outcomes to improve the identification and management of important SDB after stroke, provide critical data to plan future clinical trials, and explore a potential target to reduce an important ethnic health disparity.",Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment,9389004,R01HL126700,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Apnea', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elements', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Neurological outcome', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Pulse Rates', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disability', 'ethnic health disparity', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient screening', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'portability', 'post stroke', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'stroke risk', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke trials', 'surveillance study']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,734204,641965656,0.40221317730074
"Detecting bleeding events using EHRs for prediction in Afib Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects millions of mostly older Americans. Atrial fibrillation contributes to stroke and weighing stroke risk against risk of bleeding from oral anticoagulants (AC) is central to AF management. AC decision-making has become more complex in recent years with the introduction of several target specific oral AC agents. It remains challenging to advise older AF patients about AC since they are frequently at high risk for stroke and complications from AC, particularly bleeding, and data are limited on real-world outcomes of AC among vulnerable populations. Our project, Detecting bleeding Events using Electronic records for Prediction in Atrial Fibrillation (DEEP AF), will leverage novel biomedical natural language processing (NLP) approaches to integrate bleeding-related information from both the structured and unstructured EHR records and statistical and deep learning approaches to predict risk of bleeding on AF patients on AC therapy. DEEP AF will address present knowledge gaps to accurately identify bleeding events from longitudinal electronic health records and to improve bleeding prediction accuracy and focus on modifiable, clinically relevant risk factors, thereby facilitating future large-scale comparative effectiveness studies evaluating AC agents, and helping clinicians develop better approaches to weighing AC risks and benefits. Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects millions of mostly older Americans.

"Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke Project Summary / Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the world’s most common serious heart rhythm problem and causes 15% of all strokes, a major cause of disability and death among Americans.1 Long-term monitoring for early AF detection and treatment is recommended for many stroke patients, but although existing cardiac monitors are accurate, they suffer from methodologic and cost limitations that preclude their long-term use. In the proposed, “Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation Real-Time in Stroke,” Study, our overall objective is to enhance paroxysmal AF (pAF) detection by enhancing and testing Pulsewatch, an innovative, smartwatch-based technology for long-term rhythm monitoring of stroke patients. For Aim 1, we embed our state-of-the art AF detection algorithms, interactive messaging to promote adherence, and novel contact and motion noise correction capabilities into a smartwatch to enable near-continuous pulse waveform analysis. We will further refine Pulsewatch through focus groups and a Hack-a-thon with stroke patients and their medical providers. For Aim 2, we will enroll 90 stroke survivors and provide them with a smartphone and smartwatch, both encoded with Pulsewatch. We will compare the performance of Pulsewatch when worn daily for 7 days to conventional 7-day cardiac monitoring for pAF detection. For Aim 3, we will determine the acceptability and usability of Pulsewatch through follow-up interviews and focus groups in 30 randomly selected participants from Aim 2 asked to continue wearing smartwatch daily for an additional 30 days. We will identify patient factors associated with adherence and evaluate the impact of Pulsewatch use on disease-specific quality of life, anxiety, and self- activation among the 30 users compared to 30 stroke patients treated with usual care through baseline and 1- month assessments. Our research will lead to the development of a highly acceptable, enabling cardiovascular monitoring technology designed by, and for, stroke patients that facilitates long-term non-invasive screening for pAF, as well as communication between stroke patients and their medical providers.

Accordingly, we propose a series of prospective investigations involving stroke patients and their medical providers focused on developing, validating, and field-testing a new smartwatch-based AF detection platform, Pulsewatch, to create a mobile technology that can detect paroxysms of AF, accelerate their treatment, is user-centric, and is of great intrinsic acceptability.",Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke,9523887,R01HL137734,"['Adherence', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Mail', 'Engineering', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fingers', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart Rate', 'Immigrant', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Market Research', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Representative', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Self Efficacy', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spottings', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cryptogenic stroke', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'heart rhythm', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'iterative design', 'lens', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preference', 'prospective', 'screening', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'smartphone Application', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'usability']",NHLBI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2018,853336,294146927,0.2670392199258643
"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.            Subproject-1    Modeling treated recovery from aphasia    Lead Investigator: Julius Fridriksson, Ph.D.            DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of serious adult disability in the United States. One of the most devastating impairments resulting from stroke is aphasia, a language impairment caused by left hemisphere damage involving cortical language areas. It is generally accepted that behavioral aphasia treatment is effective. Nevertheless, different patients experience very different degrees of benefit from aphasia treatment. Despite considerable differences in the response to aphasia treatment, the relationship between patient factors and treatment response is poorly understood and very few reliable prognostic indicators have been identified. This is a major problem, as both time and resources are wasted when clinicians do not know what patients are likely to respond to treatment, or which treatment best fits individual patients. The purpose of the current project is to develop a model that includes biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors to predict patients' response to aphasia treatment. Aphasia severity is one of the few factors that have been identified as a reliable predictor of performance in treatment; it is generally accepted that more severe aphasia is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. However, aphasia severity is a multidimensional construct and patients with similar overall severity scores might demonstrate very different language impairment profiles. To better understand how language impairment relates to treatment outcomes, the dual stream model (DS model;1) will be consulted. Specifically, we will test whether measures of proportional damage to the cortical areas that comprise the DS model improve prediction of aphasia treatment response, beyond biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors. Although the DS model is a functional model grounded in neuroanatomy, we expect measures of speech and language that assesses processes supported by the two major components of the DS model - the dorsal and ventral streams - might be redundant with measures of cortical damage. To understand whether our predictive model can be generalized across different kinds of treatment foci, each patient will undergo treatment devoted to phonological stimulation and a separate treatment phase focusing on semantic stimulation. Ultimately, the goal here is to construct a predictive model that will be made available on- line so that clinicians can enter test scores from individual patients to predic how likely a given patient is to respond to treatment, as well as the focus of that treatment.         There is a great need for prognostic indicators of aphasia treatment response. At the completion of our research, we will understand why some patients respond better to aphasia treatment than others. We have selected treatment approaches that are routinely used in clinical practice, allowing for immediate translation of the findings directly into patient management. The current project will yield a vast dataset that will be made publicly available allowing others to study further aphasia treatment response in relation to cognitive/linguistic and lesion factors.              ",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),9455467,P50DC014664,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biography', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dorsal', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Employment', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'aphasic', 'behavior test', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'fitness', 'hemisphere damage', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'phonology', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2018,2212889,45219910,0.17149440120445703
"Comparative Effectiveness of Oral Anticoagulants in Atrial Fibrillation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Atrial fibrillation (AF), a common cardiac arrhythmia, affects >2 million Americans and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Adequate antithrombotic treatment in AF is critical to preventing stroke and other complications. To date, this has been mostly achieved with vitamin K antagonists (warfarin in the US). Warfarin use, however, is burdensome and carries a significant risk of complications. Recently, new oral anticoagulants (OACs; dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) have proved in randomized trials to be at least as efficacious as warfarin in preventing stroke in AF patients. Randomized trials, however, are not always generalizable to the usual clinical setting. Therefore, additional research is necessary to determine the effectiveness of these new OACs, compared to warfarin, and to identify patients more likely to benefit from the new medications. In this application, we propose to assess the following specific aims: (1) to estimate the effectiveness of new OACs versus warfarin treatment in the prevention of ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, healthcare utilization, and mortality;(2) to assess the risk of bleeding and other complications (myocardial infarction, dyspepsia) associated with use of new OACs versus warfarin in these patients; (3) to identify patient subgroups, defined by age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, and use of other medications, for which the new OACs are particularly beneficial or hazardous; and (4) to develop and validate risk predictive models of stroke / cardioembolic complications and severe hemorrhage in AF patients using new OACs. To address these research questions, we will use two large claim databases, OptumInsight and MarketScan. These databases include health insurance claims from over 1 million patients with AF, and >155,000 users of new OACs. State- of-the-art methods for comparative effectiveness research, including high-dimensional propensity scores, marginal structural models, and instrumental variables, will be used to adjust for confounding. Results from our research will provide key evidence to help patients and clinicians make decisions about their anticoagulant treatment, balancing benefits and risks associated with different therapeutic options. This proposal also has the potential to inform decisions by regulatory agencies, insurers, health system leaders, and professional organizations in issues such as post marketing approval, reimbursements, and clinical guidelines. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Limited information exists on the ""real-world"" effectiveness of new oral anticoagulants compared to warfarin in the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation,a common cardiac arrhythmia. The proposed research will provide timely and necessary information to help clinicians and patients make well-founded decisions on the use and choice of oral anticoagulants.

"Prediction Model for Incident Stroke for Early Screening of an Individual at Risk of Stroke ABSTRACT Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States and other developed countries. About 800,000 people in the United States have a stroke each year. The incidence of stroke is expected to increase (due to diabetes, an aging population and a rise in obesity), which is a major public health concern and great economic burden to society. Early identification of people at risk of stroke is important as it allows for better planning and implementation of preventative strategies. A number of risk prediction models have been proposed for stroke using common biomarkers such as lipids, and conventional risk factors including age, gender, history of hypertension and smoking. However, these models do not adequately capture a substantial proportion of persons at high risk of stroke they lack precision (best accuracy is up to 50% by Framingham risk score) in risk estimation and have other limitations. Therefore, it is a necessity to improve the accuracy of a stroke risk prediction model. Therefore, we aim to develop a novel model using retinal vessel features and conventional risk factors which will provide higher accuracy on stroke prediction than the existing models and provide better preventative strategies for the people at risk of stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the risk of stroke. Hence, identification of patients at risk of incident stroke is critically needed to help prevent this life-threatening disease. To achieve this goal, we propose to develop an automated screening system that can be widely deployed to identify these individuals at risk of stroke.",Prediction Model for Incident Stroke for Early Screening of an Individual at Risk of Stroke,9465584,R43NS102100,"['Age', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'American', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Asians', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Body mass index', 'Brain imaging', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Economic Burden', 'Educational Background', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Hispanics', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Lesion', 'Licensing', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurologist', 'Obesity', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reflex action', 'Reporting', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Veins', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Width', 'aging population', 'base', 'checkup examination', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'platform-independent', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'racial and ethnic', 'retina blood vessel structure', 'screening', 'white matter']",NINDS,"IHEALTHSCREEN, INC.",R43,2017,303622,585067,0.35257871588316464
"Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are critical to identify because prevention therapy can reduce the risk of future vascular events by > 50%. Diagnostic testing and therapeutic intervention must start as soon as possible because 10-25% of TIAs have a stroke within 90 days. Because so many patients present emergently with transient neurological events the large majority of whom do not go on to have a stroke, methods for identifying TIAs at high risk for stroke have been sought so that work up and treatment can be targeted to those who need it most to save time, money and limited resources. Though the ABCD2 score and brain Diffusion Weighted Imaging-MRI (DWI-MRI) have improved prediction of which TIAs have a stroke, their sensitivity and specificity for prediction of individual cases i poor. In this proposal we propose that peripheral blood leukocytes and platelets play pivotal roles in which TIAs go on to have a stroke and by assessing RNA in whole blood we can evaluate leukocyte and platelet function in TIA patients who go on to have stroke versus those that do not have a stroke. We hypothesize that specific coagulation and immune genes are activated in TIA patients that predispose them to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIA patients who do NOT have a stroke by 90 days. A subset of these leukocyte and platelet mRNA genes will predict TIAs who have a stroke by 90 days. This hypothesis is addressed by the following specific aims. Aim #1 (Derivation Cohort): Demonstrate that mRNA expression measured using RNAseq from whole blood differs in a derivation cohort of TIAs that go on to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIAs who do not have a stroke by 90 days. Demonstrate that most mRNA found to be regulated using RNAseq are also significantly regulated when measured using qRT-PCR. Aim #2 (Derivation Cohort): Apply machine learning algorithms to the mRNA from Aim #1 to derive an optimal subset of mRNA regulated by both RNAseq and qRT-PCR that predict which TIAs have strokes by 90 days compared to those who do not with >95% sensitivity on cross-validation. Aim #3 (Validation Cohort): Use machine/prediction learning algorithms to demonstrate that the genes from Aim #2 when measured using qRT-PCR on an independent validation cohort predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days with >85% sensitivity. The goal of these studies is to discover mRNA profiles in blood that predict which TIA patients go on to have strokes by 90 days. When confirmed in future studies, this will direct in depth testing to those high risk TIAs most in need in order to prevent strokes, and decrease unnecessary testing in those with low risk of stroke. Equally as important, the genes discovered to be associated with high risk of stroke in TIA patients will represent potential novel stroke prevention targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine RNA in blood using RNAseq and qRT-PCR of human subjects with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) who have a stroke by 90 days compared to TIAs who do not have a stroke. The regulated mRNA, exons and alternatively spliced transcripts in a Derivation Cohort of TIA patients will be used to predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days in a Validation Cohort of TIA patients.",Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs),9243329,R01NS097000,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Emergency Situation', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Labyrinthine disorder', 'Learning', 'Leukocytes', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Migraine', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prevention therapy', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA', 'ROC Curve', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'cohort', 'gene discovery', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'improved', 'mRNA Expression', 'monocyte', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'release factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2017,569977,254622553,0.38851526230826955
"Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data It is a common clinical occurrence that neuroimaging scans obtained in the course of routine clinical care discover a prior brain infarction in patients with no history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Indeed, epidemiologic studies indicate that silent brain infarctions (SBI) are far more common than strokes; MRI- defined SBI can be detected in ~20% of the healthy elderly. In these studies based on screened patients, the findings have been shown to be associated with subtle, typically unrecognized, deficits in physical and cognitive function. These imaging findings are also strong, independent risk factors for future stroke and dementia. Despite the very high prevalence of SBI in screened populations, and their serious consequences, little is known about the significance or the appropriate management of SBI when discovered incidentally in routine care. While there is strong evidence that antiplatelet therapy and statin therapy are effective in preventing recurrent stroke in patients with prior stroke, the degree to which these results apply to patients with SBI is unclear. Because patients with SBI define a population that falls in between primary and secondary stroke prevention, the approach to these patients is marked by uncertainty and practice variation, making it an ideal condition for observational comparative effectiveness research. Nonetheless, there are serious challenges for the study of SBI. As patients have no overt symptoms, recruitment into a trial can be problematic. Comparative effectiveness research on SBI, using routinely collected data and leveraging the variation in care of these patients, is impeded by the fact that there are no ICD codes for SBI, and it is generally not included in structured fields of electronic health records (EHR) as it is typically considered an incidental finding. In order to establish the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies for SBI in a large, heterogeneous population, we propose to develop Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to identify individuals with SBI through the automated review of neuroradiology reports. We have performed preliminary work to demonstrate that such an approach is feasible. We will then apply state-of-the-science observational comparative effectiveness methods in a massive database with linked EHR and claims data to examine the effectiveness of statins and antiplatelet agents in preventing future stroke and dementia. Thus, our aims are: Aim 1: We will develop NLP algorithms that can accurately identify cases of SBI and white matter disease (WMD) in two different health systems. Aim 2: We will port, refine, and validate the NLP algorithm in a large heterogeneous database including more than 600 hospitals and 6500 clinics and identify a large cohort of patients with routinely-discovered SBI and WMD. Aim 3: We will characterize the cohort with respect to age- specific prevalence of SBI, management patterns, and the risk of future stroke and dementia associated with SBI and WMD. Aim 4: We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of preventive therapies (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally-discovered SBI. The goal of this project is to improve the evidence base for the prevention of stroke in patients with “silent brain infarct”—i.e., a stroke on neuroimaging (head CT or MRI) but no clinical evidence of a stroke. We will develop a computer-based algorithm using a technology known as natural language processing that can accurately identify cases of silent brain infarction among a large population of adults on whom neuroimages have been obtained, but who are without a history of clinically-evident cerebrovascular disease. We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of medications (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally discovered and reported SBI.",Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data,9365110,R01NS102233,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Infarction', 'Caring', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Informatics', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention approach', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive therapy', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'White Matter Disease', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'case finding', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'effectiveness research', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'falls', 'improved', 'learning progression', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'repository', 'routine care', 'screening', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,711929,17640378,0.273588154439618
"Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and a leading cause of death in the US, and results in $21 billion in direct medical costs each year. Stroke disproportionately impacts minorities including Hispanics who have higher stroke risk, poorer outcomes after stroke, and a higher prevalence of post-stroke sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Declining stroke mortality in combination with the aging US population will result in dramatic increases in the number of disabled stroke survivors, with the largest increases projected among Hispanics. New approaches to improve stroke outcomes are therefore urgently needed, and may be particularly important among Hispanics, the largest US minority population. One critical yet scarcely explored opportunity may exist through identification and treatment of SDB in individuals with stroke. SDB is highly prevalent after stroke, and its presence predicts poor functional outcome and higher mortality. Nonetheless, very few stroke patients are screened or treated for SDB. Little information is available about which patients are likely to have high risk SDB after stroke; the trajectory of SDB in this setting and how to predict it; and almost no data are available for Hispanics. This information may offer opportunities to improve critical post-stroke outcomes and lessen ethnic stroke disparities. Thus, the main goals of the research proposed are 1) develop risk stratification models for post-stroke patients with SDB, 2) provide novel insight into the trajectory that SDB takes after stroke to inform management decisions, 3) inform the design of a subsequent clinical trial that will assess the impact of treatment of high risk SDB on key post-stroke outcomes, and 4) explore a possible treatable cause for worse stroke outcomes in Hispanics. We plan to take advantage of an exceptional opportunity provided by the ongoing Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project (R01 NS38916). In this population-based stroke surveillance study in a bi-ethnic community, all acute ischemic stroke patients are interviewed at baseline and followed prospectively for 3, 6 and 12 month outcomes. The current application will add longitudinal SDB assessments to BASIC using a validated portable SDB screening device. SDB severity will be assessed with the apnea/hypopnea index, as well as innovative measures derived from signal analysis. Use of BASIC provides a cost-effective opportunity to expand our knowledge about SDB after stroke in ways that can directly impact clinical care, future clinical trial design, and health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), which affects over half of stroke patients, predicts poor outcomes after stroke. Leveraging the infrastructure of the BASIC project, we propose a longitudinal, population-based study of SDB and stroke outcomes to improve the identification and management of important SDB after stroke, provide critical data to plan future clinical trials, and explore a potential target to reduce an important ethnic health disparity.",Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment,9195060,R01HL126700,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Apnea', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elements', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Neurological outcome', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Pulse Rates', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disability', 'ethnic health disparity', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'portability', 'post stroke', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'stroke survivor', 'surveillance study']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,722492,641965656,0.40221317730074
"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.            Subproject-1    Modeling treated recovery from aphasia    Lead Investigator: Julius Fridriksson, Ph.D.            DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of serious adult disability in the United States. One of the most devastating impairments resulting from stroke is aphasia, a language impairment caused by left hemisphere damage involving cortical language areas. It is generally accepted that behavioral aphasia treatment is effective. Nevertheless, different patients experience very different degrees of benefit from aphasia treatment. Despite considerable differences in the response to aphasia treatment, the relationship between patient factors and treatment response is poorly understood and very few reliable prognostic indicators have been identified. This is a major problem, as both time and resources are wasted when clinicians do not know what patients are likely to respond to treatment, or which treatment best fits individual patients. The purpose of the current project is to develop a model that includes biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors to predict patients' response to aphasia treatment. Aphasia severity is one of the few factors that have been identified as a reliable predictor of performance in treatment; it is generally accepted that more severe aphasia is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. However, aphasia severity is a multidimensional construct and patients with similar overall severity scores might demonstrate very different language impairment profiles. To better understand how language impairment relates to treatment outcomes, the dual stream model (DS model;1) will be consulted. Specifically, we will test whether measures of proportional damage to the cortical areas that comprise the DS model improve prediction of aphasia treatment response, beyond biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors. Although the DS model is a functional model grounded in neuroanatomy, we expect measures of speech and language that assesses processes supported by the two major components of the DS model - the dorsal and ventral streams - might be redundant with measures of cortical damage. To understand whether our predictive model can be generalized across different kinds of treatment foci, each patient will undergo treatment devoted to phonological stimulation and a separate treatment phase focusing on semantic stimulation. Ultimately, the goal here is to construct a predictive model that will be made available on- line so that clinicians can enter test scores from individual patients to predic how likely a given patient is to respond to treatment, as well as the focus of that treatment.         There is a great need for prognostic indicators of aphasia treatment response. At the completion of our research, we will understand why some patients respond better to aphasia treatment than others. We have selected treatment approaches that are routinely used in clinical practice, allowing for immediate translation of the findings directly into patient management. The current project will yield a vast dataset that will be made publicly available allowing others to study further aphasia treatment response in relation to cognitive/linguistic and lesion factors.              ",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),9244766,P50DC014664,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biography', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dorsal', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Employment', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'aphasic', 'behavior test', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'fitness', 'hemisphere damage', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'phonology', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2017,2210408,45219910,0.17149440120445703
"Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are critical to identify because prevention therapy can reduce the risk of future vascular events by > 50%. Diagnostic testing and therapeutic intervention must start as soon as possible because 10-25% of TIAs have a stroke within 90 days. Because so many patients present emergently with transient neurological events the large majority of whom do not go on to have a stroke, methods for identifying TIAs at high risk for stroke have been sought so that work up and treatment can be targeted to those who need it most to save time, money and limited resources. Though the ABCD2 score and brain Diffusion Weighted Imaging-MRI (DWI-MRI) have improved prediction of which TIAs have a stroke, their sensitivity and specificity for prediction of individual cases i poor. In this proposal we propose that peripheral blood leukocytes and platelets play pivotal roles in which TIAs go on to have a stroke and by assessing RNA in whole blood we can evaluate leukocyte and platelet function in TIA patients who go on to have stroke versus those that do not have a stroke. We hypothesize that specific coagulation and immune genes are activated in TIA patients that predispose them to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIA patients who do NOT have a stroke by 90 days. A subset of these leukocyte and platelet mRNA genes will predict TIAs who have a stroke by 90 days. This hypothesis is addressed by the following specific aims. Aim #1 (Derivation Cohort): Demonstrate that mRNA expression measured using RNAseq from whole blood differs in a derivation cohort of TIAs that go on to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIAs who do not have a stroke by 90 days. Demonstrate that most mRNA found to be regulated using RNAseq are also significantly regulated when measured using qRT-PCR. Aim #2 (Derivation Cohort): Apply machine learning algorithms to the mRNA from Aim #1 to derive an optimal subset of mRNA regulated by both RNAseq and qRT-PCR that predict which TIAs have strokes by 90 days compared to those who do not with >95% sensitivity on cross-validation. Aim #3 (Validation Cohort): Use machine/prediction learning algorithms to demonstrate that the genes from Aim #2 when measured using qRT-PCR on an independent validation cohort predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days with >85% sensitivity. The goal of these studies is to discover mRNA profiles in blood that predict which TIA patients go on to have strokes by 90 days. When confirmed in future studies, this will direct in depth testing to those high risk TIAs most in need in order to prevent strokes, and decrease unnecessary testing in those with low risk of stroke. Equally as important, the genes discovered to be associated with high risk of stroke in TIA patients will represent potential novel stroke prevention targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine RNA in blood using RNAseq and qRT-PCR of human subjects with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) who have a stroke by 90 days compared to TIAs who do not have a stroke. The regulated mRNA, exons and alternatively spliced transcripts in a Derivation Cohort of TIA patients will be used to predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days in a Validation Cohort of TIA patients.",Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs),9127532,R01NS097000,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Emergency Situation', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Labyrinthine disorder', 'Learning', 'Leukocytes', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Migraine', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prevention therapy', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'ROC Curve', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'gene discovery', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'improved', 'mRNA Expression', 'monocyte', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'prospective', 'release factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2016,620686,254622553,0.38851526230826955

"High Content Sceening for Hereditary Stroke Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebral Cavernous Malformation (CCM) is a hereditary stroke syndrome that has no treatment other than neurosurgery. Loss of one of three genes causes CCM. By reducing the expression of one of these genes (CCM2) in the cells that line blood vessels (endothelial cells), unique structural and functional phenotypes result. We will use a chemical suppression screen in cell culture systems to discover small molecules that rescue these distinct phenotypes. Our high-throughput platform consists of two primary screens: the first is an imaging screen with machine-learning based phenotype analysis; the second screen uses electric cell substrate impedance sensing to detect changes in endothelial barrier function. We will then further screen the top candidate compounds in a mouse model of human CCM disease.

"Biomarker panel to differentiate stroke from stroke mimic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United States (US), stroke affects more than 700,000 people annually in the U.S. and is the third leading cause of death. Stroke patients may present to the emergency room with a wide variety of symptoms that can be caused by other conditions not related to stroke, collectively called stroke mimic. Even at the most advanced stroke centers, the diagnosis of ischemic stroke is made by clinical examination after ruling out hemorrhagic lesions by imaging. These imaging tests can be used to diagnose hemorrhagic stroke but is relatively ineffective in detecting most ischemic stroke. A reliable and rapid method to distinguish stroke and stroke mimic is a necessary aid to current examination and imaging-based stroke diagnosis and will become more crucial with the implementation of new therapies for the time-critical treatment of ischemic stroke. In contrast to cardiovascular disease and oncology, no approved immunoassay or molecular test is available to aid diagnosis. Analysis of a previous dataset demonstrated that our advanced GeneRx algorithm technologies were able to develop an accurate diagnostic model where other multi-marker panels failed. In this phase I proposal we will perform a validation study, collecting blood samples from 200 admitted with stroke-like symptoms and diagnosed as stroke or stroke mimic. We will measure stroke biomarker protein levels markers present in the top combinations and algorithms from our previous study, and utilize our proprietary GeneRx technology to develop a multiple marker predictive model for accurate differentiation of stroke from stroke mimic. Project Narrative: Currently no blood test is available to help accurately diagnose stroke patients. This study develops a diagnostic to help differentiate stroke patients from the many non-stroke patients that arrive at the ER with stroke-like symptoms. Successful development of this diagnostic will increase the effectiveness and speed of stroke treatment to increase a patient's chances of improvement and safety of treatment.          n/a",Biomarker panel to differentiate stroke from stroke mimic,7405215,R43NS061455,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alteplase', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coagulation Process', 'Condition', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Economic Burden', 'Effectiveness', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Facilities and Administrative Costs', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunoassay', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically significant', 'oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rapid technique', 'social', 'statistics', 'validation studies']",NINDS,"PREDICTION SCIENCES, LLC",R43,2008,252533,0,0.403687481133674
"c-FN as a predictor of hemorrhagic transformation in t-PA treated stroke patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently there is only one approved drug treatment for acute ischemic stroke, t-PA. t-PA is a highly beneficial treatment but is severely underutilized due largely to fear of an often fatal side effect called hemorrhagic transformation. There is a critical clinical need for a diagnostic to identify patients that are at high and low risk of hemorrhagic transformation (HT). A preliminary study showed that plasma level of cellular fibronectin (c-Fn) was predictive of t-PA induced HT. We will collect patient samples and perform a validation study to confirm the utility of c-Fn as a molecular diagnostic for the prediction of more severe forms of HT. In this study we will determine the threshold levels of c-Fn that are most predictive of outcome, determine if the elevation of c-Fn is time dependant, and follow c-Fn levels through treatment. In addition we will analyze additional plasma biomarkers, matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP9), apolipoprotein C-III (Apo-C), and serum amyloid A (SAA) as potential contributors to c-Fn to more accurately predict HT. A successful diagnostic would greatly improve safety and increase use of t-PA/thrombolytics in the treatment of stroke. This validation study develops the first biomarker-based diagnostic to aid physicians in the identification of patients with high and low risk of bleeding as a result of clot busting treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Successful development will increase safety and usage of this highly beneficial treatment as well as lower overall healthcare cost as a result of stroke.          n/a",c-FN as a predictor of hemorrhagic transformation in t-PA treated stroke patients,7220477,R43NS057921,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alteplase', 'American', 'Americas', 'Apolipoproteins C', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood Clot', 'Blood coagulation', 'Brain', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coagulation Process', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease regression', 'Economic Burden', 'Elevation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Evolution', 'Facilities and Administrative Costs', 'Fibronectins', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hour', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Metalloproteases', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Non-linear Models', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological reperfusion', 'Plasma', 'Predictive Factor', 'Publications', 'Purpose', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum amyloid A protein', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Statistically Significant', 'Stroke', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thrombolytic Therapy', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Trees', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Validation', 'Vascular blood supply', 'apolipoprotein C-III', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'desire', 'disability', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'nervous system disorder', 'point of care', 'prognostic', 'social', 'statistics', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NINDS,"PREDICTION SCIENCES, LLC",R43,2007,206191,0,0.22583365424200877
"MEDIC ONE STROKE SCALE As stroke therapies emerge, they will likely work better if given earlier after stroke onset.  This Patient-oriented Research Career Development Award proposal involves the design, implementation and validation of a prehospital stroke scale, the Medic One Stroke Scale (MOSS), with Dr. David Tirschwell as the principal investigator.  Dr. Tirschwell is a neurologist completing a Master's degree in epidemiology at the University of Washington and plans a career as a stroke clinical researcher and epidemiologist.  He will further his research training through study of issues surrounding the creation and validation of clinical measurement tools.  Dr. Tirschwell has been studying the prehospital care of stroke patients in Seattle, Washington in collaboration with members of the Departments of Neurology and Epidemiology and Seattle Medic One (fire department). The hypothesis is that this continued collaboration can produce a rapid, reliable, easy to use stroke evaluation tool for the prehospital setting that will facilitate accurate identification and efficient transport times for acute stroke patients.  A further hypothesis is that with this same tool, one can provide a useful early measure of stroke severity.  Two versions of the MOSS will be created, a cohort of patients evaluated with each, and Dr. Tirschwell will examine the patients at a 3-month follow-up visit to determine outcomes.  The first version (prediction) will record historical and clinical variables and evaluation and transport times.  The shorter second version (validation), incorporating only the most predictive variables, will be associated with diagnosis and triage algorithms to minimize transport time for the most urgent stroke cases.  The ease of use, reliability and predictive value of the MOSS will be validated in the second cohort and compared with the Glasgow Coma Scale and medical record abstracted NIHSS.
