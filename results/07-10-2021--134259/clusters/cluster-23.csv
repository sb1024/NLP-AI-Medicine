"Factors Associated with Mailed Return of Self-Sampling for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Testing Project Summary/Abstract Cervical cancer disproportionately affects women who are low-income and never/underscreened (never screened or under screened) especially in Indiana, where cervical cancer incidence and mortality are higher than the US national average, and screening is lower than the US national average. Women who are low- income have structural and intrapersonal barriers to screening that may prevent them from obtaining provider- based screening. Although HPV testing is now accepted by USPTF guidelines, it is only endorsed for provider- collected sampling. Self-sampling for HPV testing, a method for women to collect their own cervico-vaginal sample, has been established as a feasible and acceptable alternative to provider-based cervical cancer screening in other countries and is supported by US pilot studies. HPV self-sampling is likely to be implemented as a screening option in the US in the future due to its comparable sensitivity to provider- collected HPV samples, acceptability, and potential to reach populations who are never/underscreeners. Self- sampling may overcome barriers to provider-based cervical cancer screening experienced by women who are low-income and never/underscreened and provide a convenient way to access screening. Studies testing mailed HPV kits, however, have demonstrated that 30-50% of women do not return a mailed HPV kit. Prior to widespread implementation, research is needed to identify characteristics of returners and non-returners of mailed HPV self-sampling kits. The purpose of this descriptive study is to identify factors associated with mailed return of HPV self-sampling kits using concepts from the Diffusion of Innovations Theory (advantages, compatibility, complexity, and self-efficacy) while controlling for sociodemographic, healthcare, and health behavior variables in a group of low-income and never/underscreened women. Data for this cross-sectional study will be collected at time of study consent from women (n=200) at a food pantry and nonadherent to cervical cancer screening using valid and reliable instruments. Self-sampling kits will be mailed to the women’s home within one week of consent, and women will have 4 weeks to return the kit to be considered “returners”. Logistic regression analyses will be used to analyze the relationship between the data collected at baseline consent (attributes of innovation-advantages, compatibility, complexity, and self- efficacy) and return of the self-sampling kit via mail (y/n). The results of this study will provide knowledge about factors associated with return of self-sampling kits to better understand the characteristics of returners and non-returners. Results of this project will help guide implementation of HPV self-sampling in populations who are low-income and never/underscreened whom self- sampling may most likely benefit. This study will provide a foundation for the applicant’s long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality from cervical cancer through increasing cervical cancer screening rates with an innovative technology, self-sampling for HPV testing. Project Narrative Women who are low-income and never/underscreeners are unequally burdened by cervical cancer. This study will be one of the first to identify factors associated with mailed return of a cervical cancer screening tool, self- sampling for HPV self-testing, that will provide an alternative to traditional cervical screening by removing barriers for women most at risk for cervical cancer (women who are low-income and never/underscreeners).",Factors Associated with Mailed Return of Self-Sampling for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Testing,10025580,F31NR018791,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Appointment', 'Atopobium vaginae', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Consent', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Failure', 'Food', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Indiana', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Low income', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Netherlands', 'Nurses', 'Pain', 'Pap smear', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Preventive', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Provider', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time Study', 'United States', 'Ursidae Family', 'Woman', 'base', 'cervicovaginal', 'cost effective', 'experience', 'health belief', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'instrument', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'prevent', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'sociodemographics', 'success', 'theories', 'therapy development']",NINR,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,F31,2020,32590,232986943,0.004262343029752884
"Modeling and Assessment of Maternal Uteroplacental Circulation During Pregnancy ABSTRACT In this proposal I am interested in developing a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling approach for volumetric assessment of human uteroplacental blood flow in vivo. The placenta is an organ that exchanges nutrients and oxygen between the maternal circulation and the growing fetus. In the United States, about 3.4% of pregnancies per year are affected by hypertensive pregnancy disorders (HPD) such as preeclampsia (PE), which have been found to carry both fetal and maternal risk. Associated placental pathologies are believed to be linked to alterations in maternal arterial remodeling. Currently, Doppler ultrasound (US) is the primary method of assessing flow to the placenta from the uterine artery (UtA). Clinical studies have shown a relationship between high UtA flow resistance and risk of adverse pregnancy outcome late in gestation, but it has not been reliable as an early gestation screening tool. In order to improve predictive technologies for reliable risk assessment assessment of HPD, more research into the relationship between vessel structure and function in the UtA is needed. I hypothesize that CFD modeling can be a useful tool for investigating possible pathophysiological mechanisms of HPD by simulating complex hemodynamics of the maternal vascular system including pressure, wall shear stress, and pulse wave velocity. I plan to set up various 1D CFD simulations to understand the hemodynamic parameters of normal versus abnormal pregnancies. Then, I will validate the simulations with 4D flow MRI acquired from an in vitro flow phantom and a cohort of normal and hypertensive pregnant women. I anticipate that the results of this investigation can advance scientific knowledge regarding the progression of early HPD phenotypes to adverse pregnancy outcomes. This CFD study can also demonstrate the extent to which patient-specific hemodynamic simulations can be reliable for future improvement of clinical management. This training experience will provide opportunities to build my expertise in cardiovascular physiology, fluid mechanics, medical imaging, data analysis, and clinical care. I will be publishing articles on my CFD/4D flow MRI findings and communicating the impact of this work in medicine at various internal and external symposia. This research will be conducted under the mentorship of award-winning experts and the University of Pennsylvania in cardiovascular MRI (Walter Witschey), fluid mechanics and computational modeling (Paris Perdikaris), maternal fetal medicine (Nadav Schwartz) and cardiovascular physiology (Victor Ferrari). PROJECT NARRATIVE The human placenta is an understudied organ believed to play a critical role in pregnancy health and the pathophysiology of hypertensive pregnancy disorders. Current technologies like ultrasound are limited in its ability to assess complex hemodynamics, and clinical studies have not yet found reliable biomarkers of adverse pregnancy outcomes. We will develop a computational fluid dynamic model of the maternal vessels delivering blood to the placenta and validate it with magnetic resonance imaging to characterize uteroplacental structure and function, providing future avenues for new predictive biomarkers of pregnancy health.",Modeling and Assessment of Maternal Uteroplacental Circulation During Pregnancy,9991192,F31HD100171,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists', 'Angiography', 'Arteries', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doppler Ultrasound', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electric Capacitance', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Navier–Stokes equations', 'Nutrient', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Paris, France', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placentation', 'Play', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Training', 'Tube', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Uteroplacental Circulation', 'Uterus', 'Variant', 'Vascular System', 'Velocimetries', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'arterial remodeling', 'base', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'falls', 'fetal', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'maternal risk', 'neural network', 'non-invasive imaging', 'phantom model', 'predictive marker', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pressure', 'screening', 'shear stress', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'symposium', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,45520,593605914,0.06340861671466129
"Maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress PROJECT SUMMARY Childhood traumatic stress (CTS), resulting from experiences such as abuse and neglect, is a pervasive public health problem with devastating and lasting consequences effecting overall health across the lifespan. Growing evidence shows that the negative effects of CTS are not limited to a single individual and may be transmitted across generations, increasing the risk for behavioral and psychiatric disorders in the offspring. Psychological stress during pregnancy is associated with heightened stress responses, emotional dysregulation, and behavioral problems in infancy and early childhood potentially making it a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of trauma. The majority of studies examining maternal psychological stress (MPS) during pregnancy consider the magnitude of stress as the `risk factor' for alterations in offspring development; however, psychological stress, particularly during the prenatal period, is dynamic and variable. Infant neurodevelopment occurs sequentially and is sensitive to environmental influences, meaning that the effect of any insult is likely as much about the timing, as it is the magnitude. As a result, it remains unclear which aspects of stress most strongly impact offspring development – is it simply the magnitude as previously suggested, or does the trajectory matter as well? Understanding the variability of prenatal factors and their influence on infant neurobiological and psychosocial development is critical to targeting preventive interventions. The goal of this proposal is to explore maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress. The overall hypothesis is that a history of maternal CTS will increase the amplitude and velocity of MPS trajectories compared to a low-risk group, will predict increased offspring limbic system connectivity and negative affect expression, and that an intervention to reduce MPS in a high-risk sample will alter the observed trajectories. These hypotheses will be tested using a novel methodology that characterizes the longitudinal heterogeneity of psychological symptom data to create MPS trajectories. These trajectories will be used to explore the role of timing and rate of change of MPS on offspring neurobiological and affective development and, further, to test whether these trajectories mediate the effects of CTS on infant development. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) To characterize the longitudinal heterogeneity of MPS in a sample of women with and without a history of CTS; (2) To examine the effects of heterogeneous longitudinal trajectories in MPS on offspring limbic system and negative affect development in mothers with and without childhood trauma; and (3) (Exploratory) To determine whether an intervention designed to reduce MPS will alter MPS trajectories in a high-risk sample. This study aims to elucidate the importance of trajectories of MPS for offspring brain and affective development, and as a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of CTS. Achieving these goals will provide insight into the best timing for targeted screening and interventions to alter MPS during pregnancy for women with a history of CTS and, thereby, reduce the risk of offspring psychiatric disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood traumatic stress is a pervasive public health problem with devastating and lasting consequences for psychological well-being, such as increased stress reactivity and increased risk for perinatal psychopathology. The proposed research will integrate tools from developmental neuroscience, clinical science, and computer science to: (1) examine the longitudinal heterogeneity of maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a potential mediator of childhood traumatic stress on infant brain and negative affect development; and (2) evaluate whether an intervention designed to reduce maternal psychological stress will alter the longitudinal heterogeneity of maternal prenatal stress. By identifying the importance of trajectories of maternal psychological stress during pregnancy for offspring brain and affective development, and as a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of CTS, this work stands to improve the targeting and timing of prenatal interventions for women with a history of childhood traumatic stress.",Maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress,9999677,F30MH118762,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Brain', 'Child Traumatic Stress', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Limbic System', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Stress', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Well in self', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abuse neglect', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'early childhood', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'intergenerational', 'maternal risk', 'maternal stress', 'mindfulness based cognitive therapy', 'negative affect', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'offspring', 'pediatric trauma', 'prenatal', 'prenatal intervention', 'prenatal stress', 'psychological symptom', 'psychosocial development', 'random forest', 'rate of change', 'response', 'screening', 'stress reactivity', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,50520,304670088,0.04501979135171599
"Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia PROJECT SUMMARY Preeclampsia (PE) is a devastating hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that is a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity worldwide. It affects 2-10% of women and accounts for 16% of maternal deaths related to childbirth in developed countries. PE is difficult to study because it is a multifactorial disorder with varying molecular mechanisms associated with the development of the spectrum of clinical symptoms associated with early onset, late onset, and severe PE. A personalized medicine approach applied to dissecting the underlying mechanisms of PE may be beneficial to reduce clinical incidence of this devastating syndrome. The placenta plays a key role in the development of PE, leading to widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, and systemic multi-organ failure in PE. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing protein, RNA, and lipid cargo are continuously extruded from the placenta, and are capable of interacting with maternal organs including the kidney. PE is primarily associated with placental and renal dysfunction, and PE is the most common cause of acute kidney injury during pregnancy. However, no studies have investigated the potential of placenta-derived RNA cargo as a link between placental and renal dysfunction in PE. Urinary EVs are derived from multiple tissue types and represent a trove of biomarkers that are increasingly being utilized to diagnose renal disorders. Further, urine samples can be obtained throughout pregnancy non-invasively and could potentially be utilized to identify biomarkers related to placental dysfunction in PE. In the proposed research, during the mentored phase, cutting-edge RNA-Seq technology coupled with computational biological and machine learning approaches will be applied to profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs in women with PE compared to normal pregnancy. Preliminary data indicates that it is possible to isolate and profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs from maternal urine throughout normal gestation, and that placenta-derived and placenta-specific mRNA and miRNA can be detected within the urinary EV population. This presents a novel technique that has potential to identify biomarkers as well as provide information on placental dysfunction in PE in a non-invasive manner. During the independent phase, the candidate will utilize an in vitro approach to investigate the effect of uptake of placenta-derived EVs with miRNA cargo associated with PE on the function of proximal tubule epithelial cells and cortical collecting duct cells. These two renal-specific cell types are involved in tubular reabsorption in the nephron, a process that is compromised leading to increased excretion of protein in the urine in some preeclamptic pregnancies. This proposal is multidisciplinary, utilizing basic biology, clinical research, and high-performance computing applied to investigating placental dysfunction in PE. These experiments are significant because they will generate novel information on the role of placenta- derived EVs in renal dysfunction in PE, as well as point the way towards preventative and therapeutic targets that may be transformative and clinically relevant. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will examine the transcriptome of urinary extracellular vesicles obtained non-invasively as a source of placenta-derived nucleic acids reflective of the development of preeclampsia (PE), and will con- duct in vitro experiments to determine the role of placental extracellular vesicles in renal dysfunction in PE.",Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia,10266768,K99HD096125,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Apoptosis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Childbirth', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Ductal Epithelial Cell', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Excretory function', 'Failure', 'Fetal Mortality Statistics', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypoxia', 'Immune response', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Nephrons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Organ', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Phase', 'Placenta', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Small RNA', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Tubular formation', 'Urine', 'Woman', 'associated symptom', 'biobank', 'cell injury', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'early onset', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'experimental study', 'extracellular vesicles', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kidney dysfunction', 'maternal serum', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal morbidity', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pregnancy disorder', 'premature', 'prevent', 'response', 'stillbirth', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'uptake', 'urinary']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K99,2020,60858,524978793,0.043273479825071744
"Predictive modeling of peripartum depression ABSTRACT Psychiatric problems surrounding parturition affect both the mother’s health and her child’s developmental trajectory. Peripartum depression (PPD), referring to a depressive episode occurring during pregnancy or after childbirth, is both common and morbid. PPD has been implicated in various short and long term adverse outcomes, including preterm delivery and heightened risk for mental illness in the adult offspring. In extreme cases, PPD can lead to maternal suicide and/or infanticide. Although an estimated 760,000 American women (and children) suffer from PPD each year and screening for PPD has been recommended by the USPTF, no accurate screening tool is available to adequately identify women at risk of PPD. This novel study will capitalize on the rich clinical, demographic, and laboratory information in patients’ electronic medical reports (EMRs) to improve screening for PPD. We propose to implement advanced machine learning methods to build a model to optimize identification of women at risk for PPD. We we will adopt a psycho-social- biological approach of mental illness to prospectively explore the combined effect of various disease-related factors in improving the accuracy of PPD prediction. Our dataset will make use of a sample of 20,000 women who have been followed during their obstetrical care in two leading academic hospitals in Boston. We will gather information concerning socioeconomic factors, relevant obstetric factors, and mental and physical conditions in pregnancy and disease history, as derived from laboratory test results and the patient’s report. We expect our findings to advance scientific knowledge of women at risk for PPD. Our work may lead to the development of a screening protocol that is low-cost and easily performed by health providers in clinical settings. Early identification of women at risk could potentially allow targeted interventions to reduce the prevalence and morbidity of PPD in the US. This in turn could reduce treatment costs, avoid a potentially preventable disease, and improve the quality of care and health outcomes of mothers and their children. Our study accords with the NICD high priority area of research aimed at improving the health of women during and after pregnancy and improving pregnancy outcomes. The proposed project will further the NICHD mission that women suffer no harmful effects from reproductive processes, and that children achieve healthy and productive lives. PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripartum depression (PDD) referring to the occurrence of depressive episode during pregnancy or following childbirth is a common and serious illness. While the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends universal screening for PPD, there is no accurate tool to predict women who would be at risk of suffering from PPD. The goal of this study is to test a machine learning predictive model of PPD using information in patients’ medical records to decrease PPD’s prevalence and ultimately prevent it.",Predictive modeling of peripartum depression,9958240,R03HD101724,"['Adopted', 'Adult Children', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Childbirth', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Educational Intervention', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Etiology', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Infanticide', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive service', 'Primigravidities', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality of Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Process', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Screening procedure', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Suicide', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Treatment Cost', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'antenatal', 'antepartum depression', 'base', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'health of the mother', 'holistic approach', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'obstetric care', 'patient health information', 'peripartum depression', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'primipara', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'screening', 'sociodemographic factors', 'tool']",NICHD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2020,84000,551214295,0.05834088383775495
"Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Subsequent Risk of Vascular Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, or Related Dementia: A Retrospective Cohort Study Taking into Account Mid-Life Mediating Factors. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Karen Schliep, a tenure-line Assistant Professor of Public Health at the University of Utah. Dr. Schliep is establishing herself as a young investigator in women’s life-course epidemiology, specifically in a novel area of aging research—to improve our understanding of women’s increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (RD) and create women-specific interventions to mitigate risk and improve outcomes. This award will allow Dr. Schliep to achieve her goal of research independence by providing her support to accomplish the following training aims: 1) develop expertise in biomedical informatics and population-based research methods; 2) gain experience in the conduction of clinical cognitive health assessments; 3) enhance knowledge of modifiable factors affecting women’s mid- and late-life cognitive health; and 4) expand skills to independently lead and manage a successful research program. Dr. Schliep has assembled a mentoring team comprising a primary mentor, Dr. Michael Varner, an obstetrician and nationally renowned maternal-fetal medicine investigator with expertise in pregnancy complications including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), and two co-mentors: Dr. Norman Foster, a cognitive neurologist and geriatric neurologist and recognized leader in dementia research, and Dr. Ken Smith, an internationally known expert in population-based analyses and genetic/family epidemiology. Dr. Schliep has five advisors with expertise in classification modeling, ADRD neuropsychology, mid-life women’s health, longitudinal and survival data analysis, and chronic disease epidemiology.  Little is known regarding the association between HDP, estimated to complicate 2–8% of all pregnancies, and long-term adverse maternal neurological outcomes with similar inflammatory vascular etiologies, including ADRD. An estimated 5.4 million Americans currently suffer from ADRD, two-thirds of whom are women. As the US aging population increases, prevalence of dementia is expected to approach 13.2 to 16.0 million cases by 2050. Why ADRD disproportionately affects women is not known. Dr. Schliep’s research objective is to develop classification models for the various dementia subtypes (including AD, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia) to analyze longitudinal, individual-level data to better understand how HDP may increase a woman’s risk for ADRD. Dr. Schliep will accomplish this through the following research aims: 1) increase accuracy of ADRD diagnoses within health administrative databases; and 2) investigate the association between HDP and ADRD, and mid-life mediating factors. The proposal’s expected outcomes include 1) a novel method to accurately capture dementia cases within large linked health administrative databases; 2) clarity on how HDP may be linked with specific dementia subtypes; and 3) skills, experience, and preliminary data for Dr. Schliep to support future studies identifying other sex-specific risk factors for dementia and mediating factors amenable to interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Women have a two-fold higher lifetime risk for Alzheimer Disease (AD), vascular dementia, and related dementias (RD) compared to men. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including preeclampsia, eclampsia, and gestational hypertension, may contribute to sex differences in ADRD, with midlife experiences such as depression influencing the magnitude of risk. We propose to 1) create a model that can identify AD and related dementias in a large health administrative database; and 2) test the link (and mediating factors) between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and ADRD, which will serve as the first step towards creating women’s tailored intervention that can mitigate ADRD risk for women.","Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Subsequent Risk of Vascular Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, or Related Dementia: A Retrospective Cohort Study Taking into Account Mid-Life Mediating Factors.",9892855,K01AG058781,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease care', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eclampsia', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Fertility', 'Fostering', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life course epidemiology', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Memory', 'Menopause', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurologist', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Population Database', 'Population Research', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Environment', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'administrative database', 'aging population', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'dementia risk', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'family genetics', 'health assessment', 'health difference', 'high risk', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'lifetime risk', 'men', 'middle age', 'mortality risk', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reproductive', 'sex', 'skills', 'sociodemographics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2020,124188,228951281,-0.024984307358751002
"A Multi-Omic Platform for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Characterization and Management Project Summary/Abstract Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age. Due to the complex nature of PCOS, diagnosis is often delayed and options for treatment and self-management are limited. With recent developments in high-throughput, next- generation and metabolomics technologies, there is now a unique opportunity to utilize a cost- effective, multi-omic approach to study individuals with PCOS. In this application, we propose to apply these technologies to examine women with PCOS, developing a platform that is cost-effective, scalable, integrative, and highly accurate. Our multi- omic platform (FemBio) will integrate patient’s medical records, genomics, microbiome (shotgun metagenomics), and metabolomics to create a molecular profile of women with and without PCOS. This approach has the potential to provide a more comprehensive characterization of PCOS, to lead to the identification of improved diagnostic markers, and to allow for the discovery of novel targets for treatment. Moreover, we propose a prospective observational cohort study including whole genome sequencing, shotgun metagenomic sequencing of the gut microbiome, fecal metabolomics, serum and urine hormone levels, and clinical indices in a sample of individuals with PCOS and a healthy control group. This platform (FemBio) will enable broader accessibility to the latest in molecular assays, multi- omic quantification, and computational modeling for the general public, which currently is lacking. In turn, this will improve options for PCOS characterization, long-term management, and open potentially new treatment options for the millions of women suffering from this disorder, as well as serve as a large, annotated multi-omic data set that can help the PCOS field more broadly. Project Narrative Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age. Due to the complex nature of PCOS, diagnosis is often delayed and options for treatment and self-management are limited. With recent developments in sequencing and molecular technologies for studying blood and urine, there is a unique opportunity to utilize a multi-omic approach to study individuals and disease and improve options for monitoring and therapy.",A Multi-Omic Platform for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Characterization and Management,10080951,R43HD103568,"['Age', 'Animals', 'Anovulation', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bacteria', 'Bacteriophages', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Endocrine System Diseases', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'General Population', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Hormones', 'Hyperandrogenism', 'Individual', 'Infertility', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Multiomic Data', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Ovarian', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Polycystic Ovary Syndrome', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Probiotics', 'Recommendation', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Self Management', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Vitamins', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'diet and exercise', 'genome sequencing', 'gut microbiome', 'improved', 'indexing', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbiome', 'multiple omics', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'ovarian dysfunction', 'patient health information', 'personalized intervention', 'prebiotics', 'prospective', 'reproductive', 'small molecule', 'symptom management', 'whole genome']",NICHD,ONEGEVITY HEALTH LLC,R43,2020,155473,155473,0.021935084253953553
"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9942495,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'imaging study', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive signature', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,173441,673201228,0.048775346592373606
"Obesity Prevention in Postpartum Women at High-Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Obesity is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) disease that affects 39% of adults in the U.S. Obesity rates are disproportionately rising among women and contribute to increasing rates of diabetes and CV mortality among women younger than 55 years. Pregnancy represents a life transition when many women gain excess weight. The effect of obesity is further magnified in women with preeclampsia, an independent and underappreciated risk factor for future CV disease. There is a pressing need to better understand predictors of excessive postpartum weight retention in order to deliver effective and scalable weight loss interventions during a period when women at highest risk may be particularly receptive to lifestyle change.  Social incentives, or the influences that impact behavior change based on relationships, are strong motivators of healthy behavior. The use of game design elements, such as goal-setting, has been successfully combined with social incentives to enhance healthy behavior in other disease settings. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a behavioral intervention using these novel approaches, combined with an established behavioral weight loss program, will provide an effective, and scalable solution to reduce the incidence of postpartum obesity. This proposal will leverage mentorship of senior investigators (Drs. Michal Elovitz and Peter Groeneveld) and Penn’s mature research programs in cardiovascular medicine, maternal fetal medicine, and behavioral economics. Research will be conducted in an urban and racially diverse population since these women are most likely to benefit from interventions to reduce CV risk. Aim 1 will use robust statistical methods and machine learning to create a clinical prediction tool for postpartum weight retention in an existing electronic health record database enriched with neighborhood-level data. Aim 2 will use qualitative and mixed methods to identify strategies to enhance the design of a pilot intervention using patient feedback. Aim 3 will implement a 2-arm single site randomized clinical trial to achieve weight loss in women with preeclampsia or gestational hypertension participating in an online behavioral weight loss program using remote technology and social feedback from other postpartum women.  This proposal will identify women at an early stage in life who will benefit the most from intensive lifestyle changes and will test and refine interventions that are able to be disseminated to postpartum women remotely. Dr. Lewey is a general cardiologist trained in women’s health and population science with established expertise in pregnancy associated cardiovascular disorders. The training she proposes in advanced statistical methods, qualitative analysis, and behavioral clinical trial design will position her to become a leader in women’s cardiovascular health. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions to prevent heart disease in women. The results of the proposed K23 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. PROJECT NARRATIVE The postpartum period represents a unique time in a women’s life when many women gain excess weight and make the transition to becoming overweight or obese. We propose to rigorously study predictors of postpartum obesity and evaluate an innovative approach to improve weight loss in the postpartum period using an online behavioral weight loss program and social feedback from a team of other postpartum women. By identifying women at an early stage in life who will benefit the most from intensive lifestyle changes and testing interventions that are low cost, sustainable, and remotely delivered, we hope to significantly improve cardiovascular health and reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease in women, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Obesity Prevention in Postpartum Women at High-Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,10040416,K23HL153667,"['Accountability', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Censuses', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Diseases', 'High Risk Woman', 'Hypertension', 'Incentives', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Perinatal', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physical environment', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Postpartum Women', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Social Characteristics', 'Social Environment', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral clinical trial', 'behavioral economics', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'gestational weight gain', 'health care service utilization', 'healthy lifestyle', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'novel strategies', 'obesity prevention', 'patient oriented', 'peer support', 'postpartum weight', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'prevent', 'programs', 'racial diversity', 'recruit', 'secondary outcome', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'weight loss intervention', 'weight loss program']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2020,175248,593605914,0.06419582267401439
"Developing a virtual placenta biobank Project Summary / Abstract The placenta is the first organ to develop and functions as the fetal lung, kidney, gut, skin, immune and endocrine systems. It is the cause of, and reflects changes from, most diseases in pregnancy, yet remains understudied. This career development proposal will train me in the tools and practice of digital pathology, while I apply them to the placenta with the hypothesis that there are reproducible, quantitative changes in the placenta that can be modeled and used to identify abnormalities via artificial intelligence (AI). I will create a publicly available atlas of microscopically normal placentas from throughout the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. Whole slide imaging will be performed on microscopic slides of placentas from the beginning of the 2nd trimester (13 weeks) through post-term (42 weeks). I will lead a team to annotate tissue type, structures, and cells. Algorithms will be trained to replicate the manual annotations. To study the changes in the placenta over time, automated measurements will be performed to identify changes in shape, size, and cellularity of placental structures that correlate with gestational age. This research can be used to develop a model of placental development and study prematurity. I will demonstrate detection of diseases of pregnancy, using preeclampsia (PreE) as an example. Placentas with microscopic changes classically seen in PreE will be scanned and annotated and algorithms trained and tested to identify them. Like many diseases of pregnancy, placental changes in PreE are variable and sometimes absent. Slides from PreE cases with no microscopic abnormalities will be scanned and examined using the quantitative parameters developed for normal placentas, testing the hypothesis that one or more of them will significantly differ between PreE cases and gestational age- matched controls. I am an Assistant Professor of Pathology at Northwestern University with an emerging focus in informatics and machine learning for diseases of pregnancy. The mentor for this project is Lee D.A. Cooper, PhD, an expert in digital pathology and machine learning. The co-mentor is David M. Aronoff, MD, an expert in maternal-child health. Mentor and co-mentor both have a history of NIH funding and graduating mentees to independence. The advisory committee consists of a digital pathology expert (Gutman), a pediatrician (Mestan) and a pathologist physician scientist (Yang). They have proposed an aggressive schedule of one-on-one meetings, coursework, seminars, and scientific meetings to supplement learning by doing the science. Completion of these studies will build my expertise in the application of machine learning to placental pathology while creating a new, publicly- accessible tool for the rapid assessment and understanding of organ structure and function with great potential to improve maternal-child health. Project Narrative The placenta grows over the course of gestation from a single layer of cells to a complex organ that acts as the fetal skin, lung, gut, kidney, immune system, and endocrine system. This project will develop an online repository of placenta microscopic images over the course of gestation from normal placentas and one disease of pregnancy, preeclampsia. Using artificial intelligence to quantitatively describe the changes over time in normal placentas and those with disease could help understand preterm birth and diseases of pregnancy.",Developing a virtual placenta biobank,10040733,K08EB030120,"['Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Cellularity', 'Child', 'Chorion', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decidual Cell', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elements', 'Endocrine system', 'Endothelium', 'Event', 'Feeds', 'Fetal Lung', 'Fibrinoid necrosis', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Hematoma', 'Hemosiderosis', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infarction', 'Informatics', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Measurement', 'Membrane', 'Mentors', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Organ', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Placenta', 'Placentation', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Radar', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Shapes', 'Skin', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Spiral Artery of the Endometrium', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Umbilical cord structure', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Villous', 'Villus', 'Yang', 'algorithm training', 'biobank', 'career development', 'cell type', 'chorionic plate', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'fetal', 'health of the mother', 'improved', 'interest', 'intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'meetings', 'microscopic imaging', 'novel', 'online repository', 'pediatrician', 'premature', 'professor', 'supplemental instruction', 'tool', 'trophoblast', 'virtual', 'whole slide imaging']",NIBIB,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K08,2020,185630,367414121,0.014336924301861446
"Towards noninvasive diagnosis of malaria PROJECT SUMMARY Plasmodium falciparum causes the deadliest form of malaria, which is responsible for nearly one million deaths annually. There is currently no perfect test to detect if a person has malaria. This is because all available tests have challenges and are all based on testing a blood sample. We have identified volatile organic compounds that are produced by the malaria parasite in culture. In a recent pilot study that was conducted in Lilongwe, Ma- lawi, we found that similar compounds are also present in the breath of children who have uncomplicated falci- parum malaria. We also observed a global change in the breath profile of children with malaria. The objectives of this proposal are to identify candidate biomarkers of malaria, with the long-term goal to develop a new non- invasive test to diagnose clinical malaria infection. Supported by our strong preliminary data that indicate that this strategy will be successful, our objectives will be met through two specific aims: 1) determine reproducible changes in the breath composition in response to malaria infection, in an independent location. 2) Relate breath changes with parasite development stages. Our approach is innovative, since we will enroll naturally infected children in the field. Children harbor the highest parasite and gametocyte densities. The proposed re- search is significant, because we will progress in development of new, much-needed malaria diagnostic tool that will not rely on blood samples. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research is highly relevant to public health because malaria kills many people worldwide each year. Our proposal will advance a new strategy to diagnose this infection, which may lead to improved malaria control efforts.",Towards noninvasive diagnosis of malaria,10005582,R21AI144472,"['Africa', 'Aftercare', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Asia', 'Australia', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood specimen', 'Breath Tests', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Exhalation', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Gene Deletion', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'HRP-2 protein', 'Health Campaign', 'Infection', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Kenya', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Malawi', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical Research', 'Molecular', 'Nose', 'Parasitemia', 'Parasites', 'Parasitology', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Risk', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'breath composition', 'candidate marker', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost', 'density', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'experience', 'global health', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malaria infection', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'pediatric patients', 'portability', 'response', 'sensor', 'specific biomarkers', 'success', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'treatment response', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R21,2020,188226,178185562,0.04992197951367498
"Identification and Prediction of Peripartum Depression from Natural Language Collected in a Mobile Health App PROJECT SUMMARY Background: Depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period affects up to 15% of US mothers, imposing costs on mother, child, and society. Early detection can significantly reduce the incidence of depression, yet depressive symptoms are often missed during prenatal visits, which tend to focus on maternal and fetal physical health, leaving less time for maternal mental health. Even if mental health is addressed during prenatal care, women may not feel comfortable answering questions that are perceived to be embarrassing or invasive. Failing to detect depression is even more likely during the postpartum period due to infrequent physician visits once the baby has been born. Measurement in the form of daily journals, which can be analyzed using natural language processing, can promote early and more frequent detection of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Study Aims: 1) Model which dynamic features of language used over time best predict changes in depression status in the pregnancy and postpartum periods, creating phenotypes of depression risk; 2) examine how the language patterns that predict depression differ for African-American and Caucasian women; and 3) identify the relationship between the characteristics of what depressed peripartum women say and their treatment-seeking behavior. Innovation: The proposed research is innovative in its use of high frequency natural language measurements, captured in daily journals using a smartphone app, combined with advances in natural language processing models, to assess the onset and trajectory of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. This is the first prospective longitudinal study using natural language collection for risk prediction in a clinical population and the first to: 1) characterize the critical topics women discuss during the peripartum period over time using open-ended journals; 2) evaluate multiple facets of language to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between language and depression; 3) use a longitudinal design approach allowing for optimal modeling of language changes associated with depression onset. Methodology and Expected Results: Monthly depression risk identified from the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. will be collected through the MyHealthyPregnancy smartphone app, a mobile health application developed through close collaboration between decision scientists, clinicians, statisticians, and local peripartum women. A daily journal embedded in the MyHealthyPregnancy app will collect natural language text from the participants for 10 months (from their first prenatal visit through two months postpartum). Using three distinct natural language processing algorithmic approaches, this study will characterize how the natural language used by peripartum women in their daily journal entries is connected to the onset and experience of peripartum depression, as measured through monthly-administered depression scales. Group- based trajectory modeling will then classify women according to the patterns in their depression scores over time. Potential Impact: This work lays the foundation for developing and evaluating real-time interventions that could be deployed at scale to women who are using language that signals high depression risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will examine how the topics (the people and events mentioned), sentiment (the positive, negative, and neutral affect), and other aspects of language expressed in daily journal entries correspond to diagnostic measures of depression and treatment-seeking in a peripartum clinical population. Psychometric and daily journal entry data will be gathered through an existing smartphone app, MyHealthyPregnancy, which monitors risk and delivers actionable information as part of routine prenatal care provided to the pregnant members of a large regional healthcare system.",Identification and Prediction of Peripartum Depression from Natural Language Collected in a Mobile Health App,9892136,R21MH119450,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Caucasians', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childbirth', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnostic', 'Disclosure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Failure to Thrive', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Language', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postpartum Depression', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prenatal care', 'Psychometrics', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Voice', 'Well in self', 'Woman', 'Work', 'antepartum depression', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'fetal', 'health assessment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'motherhood', 'natural language', 'patient subsets', 'peripartum depression', 'physical conditioning', 'pregnant', 'racial disparity', 'response', 'routine screening', 'smartphone Application', 'social culture', 'sociodemographics', 'statistical and machine learning', 'time use', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2020,233832,570146095,0.028496922307518463
"Development of a biomarker panel for minimally-invasive screening and diagnosis of gynecological disease PROJECT SUMMARY One-third of all women of reproductive age will experience nonmenstrual pelvic pain at some point in their lives and one-third of outpatient visits to gynecologists in the U.S. are for evaluation of abnormal uterine bleeding. For many women, these symptoms accompany infertility which is reported in ~10% of all US women and even higher percentages worldwide. For almost all of these women, these conditions result in a diagnostic odyssey wherein women struggle through multiple physicians over many years for a definitive diagnosis, frequently culminating in invasive laparoscopy or hysteroscopy with dilation and curettage (D&C) for definitive diagnosis. To reduce the burden of diagnosis and enable early treatment, MDDx, Inc. is developing the first biomarker- based diagnostic test to enable minimally invasive simultaneous diagnosis of four of the most common causes which together result in chronic pain, uterine bleeding and infertility: adenomyosis, endometrial polyps, leiomyoma, and endometriosis. MDDx, Inc. has been leveraging access to >12 years of longitudinally collected and deeply annotated biobanked uterine lavage samples from the Gynecologic Cancer Translational Research Program (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; New York, NY and Nuvance Health; Danbury, CT) to identify diagnostic autoantibodies (AAb) that could serve as diagnostic biomarkers for these benign gynecological diseases. By performing AAb profiling against the entire human proteome and applying our novel machine-learning based method for classification of molecular profiles we have determined that there is a common set of ~200 biomarkers that could be used to diagnose women with adenomyosis, endometrial polyps, leiomyoma, or endometriosis. The goal of Phase I is to finalize and validate the optimized set of ~200 diagnostic AAbs, while Phase II will focus on validation of the commercial diagnostic assay. In Aim 1 we will expand our proprietary database of uterine lavage autoantibody profiles to ensure that we have a sample size (~935) that will enable us to confidently apply our machine learning approaches to identifying the minimal panel of AAbs for the diagnostic. We will use this enhanced database to identify a prototype panel of ~200 AAbs for construction of classification scoring functions to distinguish between adenomyosis, endometrial polyps, leiomyoma, and endometriosis. In Aim 2 we will perform a blinded validation and performance study using an independent set of 300 uterine lavage samples to provide proof-of- concept for clinically useful sensitivity and specificity prior to large scale prospective validation in Phase II. Successful completion of this Phase I program will identify the optimized panel of AAbs for an affordable, laboratory-based diagnostic test that will significantly reduce the number of women who will need to undergo laparoscopy or hysteroscopy with D&C for definitive diagnosis, enabling early treatment of disease and reducing the significant psychological and financial burden of diagnoses that otherwise can take years. PROJECTIVE NARRATIVE Nearly half of all women of reproductive age will experience some combination of nonmenstrual pelvic pain, abnormal uterine bleeding, and infertility in their lifetimes, yet there are no non-invasive methods to definitively diagnose the primary causes of these symptoms. MDDx, Inc. is developing the first laboratory diagnostic test to enable minimally invasive simultaneous diagnosis of four common causes of these often debilitating symptoms and infertility: adenomyosis, endometrial polyps, leiomyoma, and endometriosis. This test will enable early detection, early treatment, and reduce the physical, emotional, and financial burden of obtaining a diagnosis for women suffering from these common yet disruptive symptoms.",Development of a biomarker panel for minimally-invasive screening and diagnosis of gynecological disease,10146682,R41HD104402,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Atypical Endometrial Hyperplasias', 'Autoantibodies', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dilatation and Curettage', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Endometrial Carcinoma', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Evaluation', 'Female Genital Diseases', 'Financial Hardship', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Gynecologist', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Hysteroscopy', 'Image', 'Infertility', 'Irrigation', 'Laboratories', 'Laparoscopy', 'Leiomyoma', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'New York', 'Operating Rooms', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pelvic Pain', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Polyps', 'Population Control', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preneoplastic Conditions', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Uterine Polyp', 'Uterine hemorrhage', 'Uterus', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker panel', 'chronic pain', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'diagnostic assay', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'diagnostic panel', 'disabling symptom', 'disease diagnosis', 'endometriosis', 'experience', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'medical schools', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'phase 1 study', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'reproductive', 'screening', 'translational research program', 'uterus endometriosis']",NICHD,"MDDX, INC.",R41,2020,299998,299998,-0.03677114982028079
"Automated Digital Imaging for Cervical Cancer Screening Project Abstract/Summary: Cervical cancer screening programs remain essential to reduce cervical cancer in women despite the availability of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines. Screening is important for all women but is particularly important for women living with HIV given the high prevalence of HPV in this group and risks associated with progression notwithstanding antiretroviral therapy. Here we propose to investigate the clinical utility of a new method of automated digital imaging of the cervix on the MobileODT platform as a screen-and-treat approach. We build on a long-term collaboration between the University of Cape Town and Columbia University investigating how to strengthen cervical cancer screening and treatment in South Africa. Currently, screen-and-treat programs utilizing HPV DNA testing are recommended by the World Health Organization. We have demonstrated the safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this approach for the South African setting with its high HIV prevalence in women. In this setting, we are currently completing an NCI- supported study demonstrating the feasibility and outstanding performance of an HPV DNA assay that can be used at the point-of-care for a single-visit, screen-and-treat program. Here we propose to extend this work to investigate in Specific Aim 1: the performance characteristics of automated digital imaging as a standalone, primary screening test to replace HPV DNA testing for use in the single-visit, screen-and-treat approach; Specific Aim 2: the performance characteristics of automated digital imaging as a triage test for women who test HPV DNA positive in the screen- and-treat approach; and Specific Aim 3: facility-level operational challenges and facilitators to integrating this new imaging technology into single-visit screen-and-treat programs. We propose to undertake the studies to address these aims among women living with and without HIV at clinical sites in Cape Town, South Africa. Our overall goal is to strengthen cervical cancer screening approaches to reduce cost and improve the effectiveness of screening. Project Narrative We propose to investigate the accuracy and implementation potential of a new technology that provides an automated and almost instant classification of cervical cancer precursor lesions based on a cloud-based, machine-learning algorithm of an image of the cervix. We will investigate the clinical utility of this new technology for integrating into screen-and-treat programs for women living with and without HIV in South Africa.",Automated Digital Imaging for Cervical Cancer Screening,10082877,R01CA254576,"['Acetic Acids', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Colposcopes', 'Colposcopy', 'Cytology', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'FDA approved', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'HIV', 'Health Services', 'High Prevalence', 'Histologic', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Human papilloma virus infection', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'India', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Lesion', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Price', 'Primary Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'South Africa', 'South African', 'Specificity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Group', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'automated visual evaluation', 'base', 'clinical research site', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'high risk population', 'histological specimens', 'improved', 'low and middle-income countries', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'point of care', 'programs', 'recruit', 'screening', 'screening program', 'success', 'viral DNA']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,555125,558628098,-0.042064037253434224
"Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important public health outcomes. Loss of functioning early in life due to toxins, such as metals, can have lifelong impacts. The prevention of neurodevelopmental disorders of fetal origin is impeded by the lack of objective tools for early detection of susceptible individuals. We will address the role of prenatal metal exposure on neurodevelopment, integrating this work with the overall goal of understanding how metal exposures impact placental cues, specifically release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which facilitate and direct neurodevelopment. It has been shown that placental trophoblasts actively release EVs, i.e., nano-sized membrane-bound vesicles, in both the maternal and fetal circulation. EVs shuttle cargoes of bioactive molecules from trophoblasts to recipient cells, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) that prime maternal tissues to support fetal development. In the fetal circulation, EVs can cross the blood-brain barrier, particularly in prenatal life when the barrier around the fetal brain is still porous and permeable. Not only is the placenta a primary target of metal toxicities, data show that EV signaling is sensitive to environmental influences, including metals. No study to date has investigated whether exposures to metals during the prenatal period determine alterations of circulating EV signals that, in turn, may help to diagnose and predict alterations in neurodevelopment. Notably, many placental miRNAs are known to regulate neurodevelopment and have significant overrepresentation of Gene Ontology terms associated with neurogenesis. We propose that in utero metal exposure disrupt normal miRNA expression in placental tissue and their release in circulating EVs, thus altering neural stem cell proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation during fetal development. In turn, we propose that EV-packaged miRNAs in the maternal circulation in pregnancy reflect early biological settings of this fetal programming. We will conduct a coordinated series of human studies and in-vitro experiments to: 1) characterize the risk for maladaptive neurodevelopment from prenatal exposure to toxic metals and their mixtures; 2) identify EV-encapsulated miRNAs released by the placenta in response to metals by accessing this novel form of prenatal signaling through a maternal blood draw during pregnancy, cord blood, and placental biopsy at birth; and 3) conduct in-vitro experiments to assess whether EV-encapsulated miRNAs are released by trophoblasts after treatment with individual metals or their mixtures; and whether miRNAs in EVs released from metal-treated trophoblasts alter critical functions of neural stem cells. We leverage the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort with prospective assessment of behavioral disinhibition in N=470 children followed to age 48 months. While we propose underlying theoretical pathways, the primary goal is to search for biomarkers of early risk. However, findings may also advance our understanding of molecular pathways that influence neurodevelopmental risk, which will be critical for the development of preventative strategies and possible therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal integrates experimental and clinical research on in utero metal exposures, molecular epigenetic biomarkers of placental origin and neurobehavior to create novel, cutting edge cross disciplinary research on neuroprogramming. This is a significant research advance that has the potential to identify early pregnancy biomarkers of placental/fetal health and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms that identify those at heightened risk from environmental exposures, so that interventions may be applied early to promote optimal development and improved health.",Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs,9928464,R01ES030302,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Arsenic', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cadmium', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical Research', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Encapsulated', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Diseases', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Manganese', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Physiology', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Temperament', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxin', 'Transfection', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'behavioral disinhibition', 'blood-brain barrier crossing', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'early pregnancy', 'epigenetic marker', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'loss of function', 'metal poisoning', 'nanosized', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'overexpression', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal risk factor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cell proliferation', 'tool', 'toxic metal', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment strategy', 'trophoblast', 'vesicular release']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,653362,415711940,-0.015022138852418754
"ChartGlucose4Moms: Characterizing, by Trimester, Continuous Glucose Monitoring Measurements for determining effects on Maternal & Offspring Metabolic Sequelae PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Gestational diabetes (GDM) rates are on the rise in the US, particularly among racial and ethnic minorities. GDM is associated with higher rates of large for gestational age (LGA) infants, C-section, and serious perinatal complications, and increased long-term risks of Type 2 diabetes and morbidity in both mothers and infants. Women who get treatment for GDM are less likely to experience perinatal complications and give birth to LGA infants than those who do not; therefore, rapid detection of GDM may be critical to reducing perinatal complications and disparities in birth outcomes. GDM is normally diagnosed by oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) at 24-28 weeks gestation, but clinically important insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction may be missed by not testing earlier. A metabolically unhealthy uterine environment in early pregnancy may lead to long-term negative impacts on mother and child, but how and when to test for insulin resistance and associated metabolic dysfunction in pregnancy is poorly defined. More data are needed on how glucose levels and other metabolic measures change across pregnancy to better evaluate women's metabolic risks and how those risks relate to perinatal and long-term outcomes. Using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and metabolic biomarker assays, we will describe detailed metabolic phenotype profiles over the course of pregnancy and examine how they are associated with perinatal and postpartum outcomes. We propose to recruit a diverse sample of 400 women in their first trimester from Kaiser Permanente Northwest and Kaiser Permanente Hawaii and to perform CGM, OGTT, and obtain biomarkers at 12 weeks, 20 weeks, and 28 weeks of gestation to examine how these measures relate to each other and to perinatal outcomes. Aim 1 and Aim 3 will assess the effects of CGM variables (Aim 1) and OGTT and other biomarkers (Aim 3) at each time point on the risk of LGA, other perinatal outcomes, and postpartum diabetes. Aim 2 will assess the relationship between CGM variables and diagnosis of GDM by OGTT, as well as the relationship between CGM variables and other metabolic biomarkers. We hypothesize that dysglycemia is just one marker of a much larger metabolic dysregulation that can be characterized through the work of this consortium. Characterizing a broader spectrum of metabolic dysregulation and its association with adverse perinatal outcomes will lead to improved screening regimens and treatments for pregnant women and better outcomes for both mothers and babies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy that increases the risk of pregnancy and birth complications. New tests may allow doctors to identify women with GDM earlier and more accurately than the tests currently being used, but we need to understand them better. We will recruit 400 pregnant women and screen them using both traditional and new GDM screening tools at 12, 20, and 28 weeks of pregnancy to determine how well these tools identify women who are at risk of complications and need treatment.","ChartGlucose4Moms: Characterizing, by Trimester, Continuous Glucose Monitoring Measurements for determining effects on Maternal & Offspring Metabolic Sequelae",10021656,U01DK123791,"['Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brachial plexus structure', 'C-Peptide', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cesarean section', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dystocia', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Fasting', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Fracture', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Gestational Diabetes', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypertriglyceridemia', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nonesterified Fatty Acids', 'OGTT', 'Oral Diagnosis', 'Organogenesis', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnant Women', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Shoulder', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Triglycerides', 'Uterus', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biomarker identification', 'delivery complications', 'early pregnancy', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'fetal', 'glucose monitor', 'high risk', 'improved', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'mortality', 'neonatal death', 'obesogenic', 'offspring', 'perinatal complications', 'perinatal outcomes', 'postpartum outcome', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'primary outcome', 'racial minority', 'rapid detection', 'recruit', 'reproductive', 'screening', 'stillbirth', 'tool']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U01,2020,662614,111231681,0.06765803981518179
"Cardiovascular Health After Placental Abruption (CHAP) Abstract Placental abruption is an obstetrical complication defined as premature placental separation. Despite its elusive etiology, it is believed to be the consequence of acute stimuli – ischemia, inflammation, and oxidative stress at the maternal‐fetal interface – associated with rupture of the decidual artery, resulting in (premature) placental separation. The study of abruption and maternal and newborn long‐term cardiovascular and hemorrhagic/thrombotic cerebrovascular events is the central focus of the proposed project. We will examine the long‐term impact of abruption on rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality in women and in their children. We will also investigate the relationship of clinical classification (mild and severe forms) of abruption, risks based on abruption across successive pregnancies, and abruption in twin pregnancies, on rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. We will undertake a causal mediation analysis to evaluate the extent to which these associations may be mediated through (i) preterm delivery and (ii) small for gestational age births. We will perform this analysis by clinical classification of abruption and estimate the extent of mediation following corrections for both measured (socio‐demographic characteristics, including maternal smoking, comorbid medical conditions, and obstetrical events), and unmeasured confounding. A unique aspect of this project will be to identify, through applications of Support Vector Machines and Deep Learning algorithms, subsets of women at high risk for abruption and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity. Finally, we will examine whether maternal race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status are effect measure modifiers of the association between abruption and risks of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. We propose to address these aims through a large population‐based epidemiologic study, utilizing data from the Myocardial Infarction Data Acquisition System (MIDAS), a New Jersey statewide database of all patients admitted to all non‐federal acute care hospitals in NJ with a CVD diagnosis, with longitudinal follow‐up of up to 30 years. The MIDAS data will be linked to the NJ fetal death and linked live birth‐ infant death data with associated maternal and newborn hospitalization data between 1980‐2017 to create one of the largest and most comprehensive databases in the US to evaluate the extent to which sentinel events in pregnancy impart lasting risk for women's and children's health later in life. This project will provide unprecedented opportunities to address public health, policy implications and clinical screening recommendations of women during the period following delivery regarding risk susceptibility to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE) The overarching goal of this project is to examine the associations between placental abruption and risks of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality later in life. The project will focus on overall associations, as well as identifying subsets of women at high risk based on abruption severity, recurrent abruptions, gestational age at delivery, and fetal growth restriction. This project will provide unprecedented opportunities to address public health, and policy implications regarding women's health, and clinical screening recommendations of women during the period following delivery regarding risk susceptibility to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.",Cardiovascular Health After Placental Abruption (CHAP),10051711,R01HL150065,"['Abruptio Placentae', 'Acute', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Birth', 'Cardiovascular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Gestational Diabetes', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Hemorrhage', 'High Risk Woman', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Infant Health', 'Infant Mortality', 'Inflammation', 'Ischemia', 'Life', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'New Jersey', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Patients', 'Perinatal mortality demographics', 'Placenta', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rupture', 'Sentinel', 'Severities', 'Small for Gestational Age Infant', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Uterus', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'acute care', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cerebrovascular', 'comorbidity', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning algorithm', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'health of the mother', 'high risk', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'improved', 'infant death', 'insight', 'interest', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'maternal risk', 'mortality', 'obstetrical complication', 'policy implication', 'population based', 'premature', 'screening guidelines', 'sociodemographics', 'stillbirth', 'support vector machine']",NHLBI,RBHS-ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2020,707286,26672071,0.06428791831033562
"A Platform for Safe, Noninvasive Prenatal Genetic Testing at Five Weeks of Pregnancy The purpose of this research is to provide a flexible prenatal genetic testing product that can be expanded to detect any inheritable trait as early as 5, and up to 20, weeks of gestation, from a safe, noninvasive Pap smear. Published studies, as well as our own experience, show that perinatal Pap collections using a cervical cytobrush pose no risk to mother or fetus, and captures trophoblast cells that migrate from the placenta into the reproductive tract. Trophoblast retrieval and isolation from the cervix (TRIC) efficiently isolates hundreds of trophoblast cells without limitations due to early gestational age, maternal obesity, or uteroplacental insufficiency disorders. In our report published in Science Translational Medicine, we isolated sufficient genomic DNA from intact fetal trophoblast cells obtained by TRIC at 5-19 weeks of gestation (n=20) to definitively distinguish maternal and fetal DNA by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of short terminal repeats (STRs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Compared to massively parallel sequencing of cell-free fetal DNA from maternal serum, which has a fetal fraction of only 4-10% at week 10 of gestation, the complete genome obtained by TRIC has a fetal fraction of 85-100%, and provides nucleotide-specific haplotyping. In our Phase I award, we developed this technology for prenatal genotyping of single gene disorders located on the hemoglobin B (HBB) gene, using custom multiplex PCR amplification of SNPs, STRs and loci across HBB for NGS. We successfully haplotyped the locus for the sickle cell disease (SCD) point mutation and genotyped the remainder of the HBB exome, which includes alternate SCD loci, beta thalassemias and anemias. In Phase II, we will expand the test to include HBA1 and HBA1 genes (alpha thalassemias) to provide a comprehensive hemoglobinopathy screen. Phase I studies revealed that genotyping was consistently accurate, unless cervical specimen collection was suboptimal and <40 trophoblast cells were isolated. Commercialization will require operators to obtain adequate specimens. We will accomplish six milestones towards commercialization of this test: 1. Incorporate the HBA1 and HBA2 loci into a comprehensive hemoglobinopathy test. 2. Optimize success rates through operator training and innovations in collection device designs to increase cervical cell recoveries. 3. Innovate a novel alternative method to cytobrush-based cervical collection. 4. Automate the TRIC processing pipeline for high throughput cell isolation, DNA purification and NGS. 5. Establish sample quality assessment tools powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning. 6. Perform a clinical validation trial to assess test performance. With an estimated annual market potential over $284 million for prenatal hemoglobinopathies testing, the envisioned technology will fill an existing gap in clinical diagnostics and outcompete existing invasive prenatal testing. Our initial commercial product will to enable management of high-risk pregnancies and provide valuable information to physicians and patients in the process of establishing families. Specifically, this initial product will benefit pregnancies at risk of having a child with SCA or other hemoglobinopathies such as thalassemia and anemia. This research provides major public health benefits by leveraging a safe, noninvasive method to capture fetal cells that migrate into the reproductive tract from a Pap smear for development of genetic tests to identify women carrying a fetus with an inherited disorder. We will build a DNA sequencing kit that can be commercialized to determine the genotype of fetuses at risk for sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies as early as 5 weeks of pregnancy. Advances emerging from the proposed research will generate new clinical tools for managing pregnancy complications to benefit the well-being of mothers and their babies.","A Platform for Safe, Noninvasive Prenatal Genetic Testing at Five Weeks of Pregnancy",9940863,R44HD092205,"['African American', 'Amniocentesis', 'Anemia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Automation', 'Award', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Cervical', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Child', 'Chorion', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Conceptions', 'Conceptus', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA purification', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genotype', 'Germ Cells', 'Gestational Age', 'Growth', 'Haplotypes', 'Health Benefit', 'Healthcare', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hemoglobinopathies', 'Hereditary Disease', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Mutation', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nucleotides', 'Other Genetics', 'Pap smear', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Placenta', 'Point Mutation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Short Tandem Repeat', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specimen', 'Speculums', 'Technology', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thalassemia', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Vagina', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'alpha-Thalassemia', 'base', 'beta Thalassemia', 'cell free fetal DNA', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically relevant', 'commercialization', 'data infrastructure', 'exome', 'experience', 'fetal', 'fetal diagnosis', 'fetus at risk', 'fetus cell', 'flexibility', 'genetic testing', 'genomic locus', 'hemoglobin B', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'maternal obesity', 'maternal serum', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'operation', 'performance tests', 'perinatal health', 'phase 1 study', 'prenatal', 'prenatal testing', 'reproductive', 'reproductive tract', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'testing services', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational medicine', 'trophoblast']",NICHD,"CRADLE GENOMICS, INC.",R44,2020,901625,901625,0.011446213577113059
"Hypertensive Medication Adherence in Young African American Women Project Abstract Uncontrolled hypertension [HTN] due to poor blood pressure [BP] medication adherence in young and early middle age African American [AA] women is a leading contributor for the sustained hypertension disparities in the US. AA women in the US 20-44 years of age, have the highest prevalence of Hypertension [HTN] when compared to White women of the same age group. Uncontrolled HTN is a significant risk factor for stroke, heart failure, kidney disease, and early mortality, especially in this at-risk group. Barriers prohibiting BP medication adherence have been well characterized across the AA population except in young AA women who bear an unequal and different burden of stressors than older AA women. However, important underlying factors including HTN illness perceptions/representations, unique psychosocial factors including resilient coping, and their influence on good BP medication adherence have not been sufficiently studied among this vulnerable group. Evidence indicating that AAs acquire HTN at younger ages, are less adherent, and are more resistant to treatment compared to other ethnic groups provides a compelling impetus to identify positive and modifiable factors that contribute to BP medication adherence. The specific aims of this cross-sectional dissertation study are to examine the relationships among sociodemographic & clinical profiles, HTN illness perceptions, and BP medication adherence; and examine the relationships between psychosocial factors, resilient coping style, and BP medication adherence when controlling for sociodemographic factors in a sample of young hypertensive AA women. An exploratory aim will examine the relationship of resilient coping as a potential moderator of high or low adverse stress exposure and its effect on BP medication adherence to elicit understanding of variability in BP medication adherence among this subgroup of hypertensive women. A total of 110 AA women diagnosed with HTN, 18-45 years of age, will be recruited through an ongoing community health heart screening project which is targeting AA women diagnosed with HTN, at-risk for HTN, and other cardiovascular disease risk factors in a large southern urban setting. Descriptive, bivariate correlation, and logistic regression will be used for statistical analysis of the aims. Completion of the proposed study is the first step towards understanding the impact of modifiable factors such as HTN illness perceptions and resilient coping, and their impact on BP medication adherence in this vulnerable population. This study will provide important data to inform development and testing of effective and targeted interventions to reduce HTN disparities while improving health outcomes in a population predisposed to adverse cardiovascular events. Project Narrative Young and early middle age adult AA women represent a growing group of ethnic minority women diagnosed with hypertension in the United States. This study will examine novel constructs (HTN illness Perceptions and Resilient Coping) and psychosocial factors in relation to hypertension medication adherence to determine their importance in facilitating medication adherence in a population for whom limited information is known regarding factors associated with increased levels of medication adherence. Information gained from this study may advance the field of cardiovascular research and ethnic minority hypertension disparities and may help develop culturally targeted interventions to reduce poor medication adherence, thus improving rates of uncontrolled hypertension in the future.",Hypertensive Medication Adherence in Young African American Women,9677584,F31NR017348,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiac health', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Community Health', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Coping Behavior', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'High Prevalence', 'Hypertension', 'Income', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sex Discrimination', 'Single Parent', 'Social Class', 'Social support', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'Stress and Coping', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Support System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Well in self', 'Woman', 'age group', 'associated symptom', 'blood pressure medication', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'coping', 'depressive symptoms', 'effective intervention', 'enhancing factor', 'ethnic minority population', 'high risk', 'illness perceptions', 'improved', 'insight', 'lifestyle factors', 'medication compliance', 'middle age', 'mortality', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'novel', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'racial discrimination', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'response', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'stressor', 'stroke risk', 'success', 'theories', 'urban setting', 'young woman']",NINR,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,14236,507546965,0.03309705239265951
"Factors Associated with Mailed Return of Self-Sampling for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Testing Project Summary/Abstract Cervical cancer disproportionately affects women who are low-income and never/underscreened (never screened or under screened) especially in Indiana, where cervical cancer incidence and mortality are higher than the US national average, and screening is lower than the US national average. Women who are low- income have structural and intrapersonal barriers to screening that may prevent them from obtaining provider- based screening. Although HPV testing is now accepted by USPTF guidelines, it is only endorsed for provider- collected sampling. Self-sampling for HPV testing, a method for women to collect their own cervico-vaginal sample, has been established as a feasible and acceptable alternative to provider-based cervical cancer screening in other countries and is supported by US pilot studies. HPV self-sampling is likely to be implemented as a screening option in the US in the future due to its comparable sensitivity to provider- collected HPV samples, acceptability, and potential to reach populations who are never/underscreeners. Self- sampling may overcome barriers to provider-based cervical cancer screening experienced by women who are low-income and never/underscreened and provide a convenient way to access screening. Studies testing mailed HPV kits, however, have demonstrated that 30-50% of women do not return a mailed HPV kit. Prior to widespread implementation, research is needed to identify characteristics of returners and non-returners of mailed HPV self-sampling kits. The purpose of this descriptive study is to identify factors associated with mailed return of HPV self-sampling kits using concepts from the Diffusion of Innovations Theory (advantages, compatibility, complexity, and self-efficacy) while controlling for sociodemographic, healthcare, and health behavior variables in a group of low-income and never/underscreened women. Data for this cross-sectional study will be collected at time of study consent from women (n=200) at a food pantry and nonadherent to cervical cancer screening using valid and reliable instruments. Self-sampling kits will be mailed to the women’s home within one week of consent, and women will have 4 weeks to return the kit to be considered “returners”. Logistic regression analyses will be used to analyze the relationship between the data collected at baseline consent (attributes of innovation-advantages, compatibility, complexity, and self- efficacy) and return of the self-sampling kit via mail (y/n). The results of this study will provide knowledge about factors associated with return of self-sampling kits to better understand the characteristics of returners and non-returners. Results of this project will help guide implementation of HPV self-sampling in populations who are low-income and never/underscreened whom self- sampling may most likely benefit.

This study will be one of the first to identify factors associated with mailed return of a cervical cancer screening tool, self- sampling for HPV self-testing, that will provide an alternative to traditional cervical screening by removing barriers for women most at risk for cervical cancer (women who are low-income and never/underscreeners).",Factors Associated with Mailed Return of Self-Sampling for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Testing,9835517,F31NR018791,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Appointment', 'Atopobium vaginae', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Consent', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Failure', 'Food', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Indiana', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Low income', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Netherlands', 'Nurses', 'Pain', 'Pap smear', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Preventive', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Provider', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time Study', 'United States', 'Ursidae Family', 'Woman', 'base', 'cervicovaginal', 'cost effective', 'experience', 'health belief', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'instrument', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'prevent', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'sociodemographics', 'success', 'theories', 'therapy development']",NINR,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,F31,2019,32086,232986943,0.004262343029752884
"Maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress PROJECT SUMMARY Childhood traumatic stress (CTS), resulting from experiences such as abuse and neglect, is a pervasive public health problem with devastating and lasting consequences effecting overall health across the lifespan. Growing evidence shows that the negative effects of CTS are not limited to a single individual and may be transmitted across generations, increasing the risk for behavioral and psychiatric disorders in the offspring. Psychological stress during pregnancy is associated with heightened stress responses, emotional dysregulation, and behavioral problems in infancy and early childhood potentially making it a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of trauma. The majority of studies examining maternal psychological stress (MPS) during pregnancy consider the magnitude of stress as the `risk factor' for alterations in offspring development; however, psychological stress, particularly during the prenatal period, is dynamic and variable. Infant neurodevelopment occurs sequentially and is sensitive to environmental influences, meaning that the effect of any insult is likely as much about the timing, as it is the magnitude. As a result, it remains unclear which aspects of stress most strongly impact offspring development – is it simply the magnitude as previously suggested, or does the trajectory matter as well? Understanding the variability of prenatal factors and their influence on infant neurobiological and psychosocial development is critical to targeting preventive interventions. The goal of this proposal is to explore maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress. The overall hypothesis is that a history of maternal CTS will increase the amplitude and velocity of MPS trajectories compared to a low-risk group, will predict increased offspring limbic system connectivity and negative affect expression, and that an intervention to reduce MPS in a high-risk sample will alter the observed trajectories. These hypotheses will be tested using a novel methodology that characterizes the longitudinal heterogeneity of psychological symptom data to create MPS trajectories. These trajectories will be used to explore the role of timing and rate of change of MPS on offspring neurobiological and affective development and, further, to test whether these trajectories mediate the effects of CTS on infant development. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) To characterize the longitudinal heterogeneity of MPS in a sample of women with and without a history of CTS; (2) To examine the effects of heterogeneous longitudinal trajectories in MPS on offspring limbic system and negative affect development in mothers with and without childhood trauma; and (3) (Exploratory) To determine whether an intervention designed to reduce MPS will alter MPS trajectories in a high-risk sample. This study aims to elucidate the importance of trajectories of MPS for offspring brain and affective development, and as a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of CTS. Achieving these goals will provide insight into the best timing for targeted screening and interventions to alter MPS during pregnancy for women with a history of CTS and, thereby, reduce the risk of offspring psychiatric disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood traumatic stress is a pervasive public health problem with devastating and lasting consequences for psychological well-being, such as increased stress reactivity and increased risk for perinatal psychopathology. The proposed research will integrate tools from developmental neuroscience, clinical science, and computer science to: (1) examine the longitudinal heterogeneity of maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a potential mediator of childhood traumatic stress on infant brain and negative affect development; and (2) evaluate whether an intervention designed to reduce maternal psychological stress will alter the longitudinal heterogeneity of maternal prenatal stress. By identifying the importance of trajectories of maternal psychological stress during pregnancy for offspring brain and affective development, and as a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of CTS, this work stands to improve the targeting and timing of prenatal interventions for women with a history of childhood traumatic stress.",Maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress,9794014,F30MH118762,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Brain', 'Child Traumatic Stress', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Limbic System', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Stress', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Well in self', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abuse neglect', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'early childhood', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'intergenerational', 'maternal stress', 'mindfulness based cognitive therapy', 'negative affect', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'offspring', 'pediatric trauma', 'prenatal', 'prenatal intervention', 'prenatal stress', 'psychological symptom', 'psychosocial development', 'random forest', 'rate of change', 'response', 'screening', 'stress reactivity', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F30,2019,50016,304670088,0.04501979135171599
"Human Microbiome and Perinatal Depression Project Summary/Abstract Depression is the most common complication of pregnancy and affects 10-20% of women. Up to 75% of women with perinatal depression do not receive mental health care. In lower income African American and Hispanic women, the prevalence of perinatal depression (PND) is particularly high and the treatment rates are lower. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment but practical barriers such as time commitment, insurance coverage, and transportation, as well as stigma, limit uptake of CBT particularly for minority women. Similarly, concern about the adverse effects of antidepressant treatment on maternal and infant outcomes limits uptake of pharmacological treatments. A novel avenue for the development of safe therapeutics for depression focuses on the brain-gut axis and is supported by initial demonstrations that probiotics can improve mood symptoms. Our long-term goal is to assist in the discovery of potential microbes that are correlated with PND, and could be novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of this disorder, particularly in minority women. As a first step, we propose a multi-PI feasibility study involving the implementation and optimization of processes for participant recruitment and stool sample collection, as well as the initial assessments of longitudinal differences in gut microbiota between pregnant women with and without major depressive disorder (MDD). To meet these goals, we will leverage an established research infrastructure to conduct a prospective, nested case-control study. We will prospectively collect depression diagnoses and gut microbiome samples on 300 women at four points during pregnancy and after delivery to yield a total of 58 women, 29 cases with MDD and 29 controls without MDD. The two groups will be matched on key covariates (e.g., age, race, socio- economic status, gestational age, health). At their scheduled usual care, prenatal appointment, consented participants will complete mental health, demographics, microbiome-related, and dietary and physical habits questionnaires and provide a fecal sample either at that time of their appointment or at home. To achieve our first aim - to determine the feasibility of a larger similarly designed study - we will estimate the total number of potential participants, the number assessed and not assessed for eligibility (and reasons), the number excluded and reasons for exclusion, the number lost to follow-up, and the data available for analysis at each of the 4 visits. To achieve our second aim - to determine whether the gut microbiome dynamically differs in pregnant women with and without MDD - we will employ a suite of systems level approaches, including multivariate statistical techniques, network modeling and machine learning techniques. This R03 will allow us to optimize our research processes for the prospective collection of stool samples and mental health data in preparation for larger nested case-control studies, and ultimately clinical trials of probiotic therapies for PND. Project Narrative Up to 75% of women diagnosed with depression during pregnancy and the postpartum receive inadequate treatment, in large part due to concerns about the safety of antidepressants. Here we propose a feasibility study in preparation for a larger study to determine whether women with depression during their pregnancy and after their delivery have alterations in the bacterial communities in their intestine. Identifying which bacteria are associated with depression is a critical first step in the development of safe probiotic treatments for depression during pregnancy. !",Human Microbiome and Perinatal Depression,9767273,R03HD095056,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Appointment', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Endocrine system', 'Epidemiology', 'Exclusion', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feces', 'Germ-Free', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immune system', 'Immunology', 'Infant', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Neurologic', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nutritional', 'Observational Study', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prenatal care', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Probiotics', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'alternative treatment', 'antepartum depression', 'antidepressant effect', 'bacterial community', 'demographics', 'depressive symptoms', 'drug development', 'dysbiosis', 'effective therapy', 'fecal microbiome', 'fecal transplantation', 'follow-up', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'gut-brain axis', 'health data', 'improved', 'infant outcome', 'insight', 'maternal stress', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microorganism', 'mood symptom', 'network models', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'nutrition', 'perinatal mental health', 'peripartum depression', 'probiotic therapy', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample collection', 'social stigma', 'stool sample', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment as usual', 'uptake']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R03,2019,83193,148463823,0.07979822822585153
"Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia PROJECT SUMMARY Preeclampsia (PE) is a devastating hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that is a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity worldwide. It affects 2-10% of women and accounts for 16% of maternal deaths related to childbirth in developed countries. PE is difficult to study because it is a multifactorial disorder with varying molecular mechanisms associated with the development of the spectrum of clinical symptoms associated with early onset, late onset, and severe PE. A personalized medicine approach applied to dissecting the underlying mechanisms of PE may be beneficial to reduce clinical incidence of this devastating syndrome. The placenta plays a key role in the development of PE, leading to widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, and systemic multi-organ failure in PE. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing protein, RNA, and lipid cargo are continuously extruded from the placenta, and are capable of interacting with maternal organs including the kidney. PE is primarily associated with placental and renal dysfunction, and PE is the most common cause of acute kidney injury during pregnancy. However, no studies have investigated the potential of placenta-derived RNA cargo as a link between placental and renal dysfunction in PE. Urinary EVs are derived from multiple tissue types and represent a trove of biomarkers that are increasingly being utilized to diagnose renal disorders. Further, urine samples can be obtained throughout pregnancy non-invasively and could potentially be utilized to identify biomarkers related to placental dysfunction in PE. In the proposed research, during the mentored phase, cutting-edge RNA-Seq technology coupled with computational biological and machine learning approaches will be applied to profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs in women with PE compared to normal pregnancy. Preliminary data indicates that it is possible to isolate and profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs from maternal urine throughout normal gestation, and that placenta-derived and placenta-specific mRNA and miRNA can be detected within the urinary EV population. This presents a novel technique that has potential to identify biomarkers as well as provide information on placental dysfunction in PE in a non-invasive manner. During the independent phase, the candidate will utilize an in vitro approach to investigate the effect of uptake of placenta-derived EVs with miRNA cargo associated with PE on the function of proximal tubule epithelial cells and cortical collecting duct cells. These two renal-specific cell types are involved in tubular reabsorption in the nephron, a process that is compromised leading to increased excretion of protein in the urine in some preeclamptic pregnancies. This proposal is multidisciplinary, utilizing basic biology, clinical research, and high-performance computing applied to investigating placental dysfunction in PE. These experiments are significant because they will generate novel information on the role of placenta- derived EVs in renal dysfunction in PE, as well as point the way towards preventative and therapeutic targets that may be transformative and clinically relevant. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will examine the transcriptome of urinary extracellular vesicles obtained non-invasively as a source of placenta-derived nucleic acids reflective of the development of preeclampsia (PE), and will con- duct in vitro experiments to determine the role of placental extracellular vesicles in renal dysfunction in PE.",Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia,9974957,K99HD096125,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Apoptosis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Childbirth', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Ductal Epithelial Cell', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Excretory function', 'Failure', 'Fetal Mortality Statistics', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypoxia', 'Immune response', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Nephrons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Organ', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Phase', 'Placenta', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Small RNA', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Tubular formation', 'Urine', 'Woman', 'associated symptom', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'early onset', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'experimental study', 'extracellular vesicles', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kidney dysfunction', 'maternal serum', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal morbidity', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pregnancy disorder', 'premature', 'prevent', 'response', 'stillbirth', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'uptake', 'urinary']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K99,2019,104534,524978793,0.043273479825071744
"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9729825,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'imaging study', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive signature', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,173441,673201228,0.048775346592373606
"Immune response to Zika infection at the primate maternal-fetal interface ABSTRACT Infection with Zika virus (ZIKV), first linked with an increased incidence of microcephaly in Brazil, is now associated with a spectrum of fetal and postnatal malformations and developmental disorders. Our previous studies with rhesus macaques have demonstrated that, like the human population, severe fetal outcomes are uncommon, but they have also revealed that vertical transmission of ZIKV to the fetus may more common than is currently appreciated, with 100% transmission to fetuses when dams were inoculated in the first or third trimester. Additional neurological deficits from intrauterine infection are now becoming revealed in postnatal life, thus a better understanding of the correlates of vertical transmission at the maternal-fetal interface is critical. Investigators at the University of Wisconsin-Madison are funded to conduct a study to define the viral persistence and distribution in maternal tissues of pregnant rhesus macaques at staged intervals following infection with ZIKV. That study specifically will evaluate maternal tissues, but does not support concurrent evaluation of the maternal-fetal interface. We hypothesize that the antiviral response in the decidua and placenta can determine the risk for vertical transmission of the virus and the degree of fetal pathology and developmental dysregulation. To address this hypothesis, we propose to comprehensively define the immune response at the maternal-fetal interface in these pregnancies in two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To define the T cell, antigen-presenting cell, and innate lymphoid/natural killer cell populations in control and ZIKV-infected decidua, establishing their transcriptional, secreted, and cell-surface profiles with high-dimensional flow cytometry and dimension reduction methodologies. Specific Aim 2. To define the Hofbauer cell surface, secreted, and activation profiles in control and ZIKV- infected placentas. We will use high-dimensional flow cytometric analytical methods established in our laboratories for human decidual leukocytes, guided by our previous work with rhesus decidual leukocytes and placental Hofbauer cells, comparing infected pregnancies with control pregnancies to be supported by this R21 proposal. The ZIKV- infected decidual and placental immunome will be interpreted in light of the distribution, burden, and pathogenic impact of ZIKV replication in the decidua and the fetus. A clearer understanding of the decidual and placental immune response with ZIKV infection, which we can couple with determination of fetal infection and pathology to be gained from the current study, will allow insight into the correlates of decidual and placental immune responses of fetal outcomes. Project Narrative: Infection of pregnant women with Zika virus has been implicated in an increase in the incidence of microcephaly in Brazil, as well as other fetal pathologies of the developing nervous system. It is not understood whether the immune response of the maternal reproductive tract or the fetal placenta itself can mitigate against the risk for fetal developmental outcomes. The nonhuman primate offers an outstanding opportunity to determine if a local response against Zika infection at the maternal-fetal interface can provide insight into developing interventions to interrupt these devastating fetal outcomes once maternal infection has occurred.",Immune response to Zika infection at the primate maternal-fetal interface,9608712,R21AI136014,"['Address', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antiviral Response', 'Autopsy', 'Brazil', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Decidua', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Membranes', 'Fetal Monitoring', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Lymphoid', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Methodology', 'Microcephaly', 'Modeling', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Optic Nerve', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Placenta', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Risk', 'Specimen', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Vertical Disease Transmission', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Viremia', 'Virus Replication', 'Visual system structure', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'ZIKV infection', 'Zika Virus', 'analytical method', 'base', 'co-infection', 'density', 'developmental disease', 'fetal', 'fetal infection', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'intrauterine infection', 'malformation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'pregnant', 'reproductive tract', 'response', 'segregation', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'transcriptome', 'transmission process', 'viral transmission', 'virtual', 'virus genetics']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2019,191250,338121506,0.009507449012772328
"Towards noninvasive diagnosis of malaria PROJECT SUMMARY Plasmodium falciparum causes the deadliest form of malaria, which is responsible for nearly one million deaths annually. There is currently no perfect test to detect if a person has malaria. This is because all available tests have challenges and are all based on testing a blood sample. We have identified volatile organic compounds that are produced by the malaria parasite in culture. In a recent pilot study that was conducted in Lilongwe, Ma- lawi, we found that similar compounds are also present in the breath of children who have uncomplicated falci- parum malaria. We also observed a global change in the breath profile of children with malaria. The objectives of this proposal are to identify candidate biomarkers of malaria, with the long-term goal to develop a new non- invasive test to diagnose clinical malaria infection. Supported by our strong preliminary data that indicate that this strategy will be successful, our objectives will be met through two specific aims: 1) determine reproducible changes in the breath composition in response to malaria infection, in an independent location. 2) Relate breath changes with parasite development stages. Our approach is innovative, since we will enroll naturally infected children in the field. Children harbor the highest parasite and gametocyte densities. The proposed re- search is significant, because we will progress in development of new, much-needed malaria diagnostic tool that will not rely on blood samples. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research is highly relevant to public health because malaria kills many people worldwide each year. Our proposal will advance a new strategy to diagnose this infection, which may lead to improved malaria control efforts.",Towards noninvasive diagnosis of malaria,9725011,R21AI144472,"['Africa', 'Aftercare', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Asia', 'Australia', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood specimen', 'Breath Tests', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Exhalation', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Gene Deletion', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'HRP-2 protein', 'Health Campaign', 'Infection', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Kenya', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Malawi', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical Research', 'Molecular', 'Nose', 'Parasitemia', 'Parasites', 'Parasitology', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Risk', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'breath composition', 'candidate marker', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost', 'density', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'experience', 'global health', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malaria infection', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'pediatric patients', 'portability', 'response', 'sensor', 'specific biomarkers', 'success', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'treatment response', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,297059,533594881,0.04992197951367498
"Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important public health outcomes. Loss of functioning early in life due to toxins, such as metals, can have lifelong impacts. The prevention of neurodevelopmental disorders of fetal origin is impeded by the lack of objective tools for early detection of susceptible individuals. We will address the role of prenatal metal exposure on neurodevelopment, integrating this work with the overall goal of understanding how metal exposures impact placental cues, specifically release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which facilitate and direct neurodevelopment. It has been shown that placental trophoblasts actively release EVs, i.e., nano-sized membrane-bound vesicles, in both the maternal and fetal circulation. EVs shuttle cargoes of bioactive molecules from trophoblasts to recipient cells, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) that prime maternal tissues to support fetal development. In the fetal circulation, EVs can cross the blood-brain barrier, particularly in prenatal life when the barrier around the fetal brain is still porous and permeable. Not only is the placenta a primary target of metal toxicities, data show that EV signaling is sensitive to environmental influences, including metals. No study to date has investigated whether exposures to metals during the prenatal period determine alterations of circulating EV signals that, in turn, may help to diagnose and predict alterations in neurodevelopment. Notably, many placental miRNAs are known to regulate neurodevelopment and have significant overrepresentation of Gene Ontology terms associated with neurogenesis. We propose that in utero metal exposure disrupt normal miRNA expression in placental tissue and their release in circulating EVs, thus altering neural stem cell proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation during fetal development. In turn, we propose that EV-packaged miRNAs in the maternal circulation in pregnancy reflect early biological settings of this fetal programming. We will conduct a coordinated series of human studies and in-vitro experiments to: 1) characterize the risk for maladaptive neurodevelopment from prenatal exposure to toxic metals and their mixtures; 2) identify EV-encapsulated miRNAs released by the placenta in response to metals by accessing this novel form of prenatal signaling through a maternal blood draw during pregnancy, cord blood, and placental biopsy at birth; and 3) conduct in-vitro experiments to assess whether EV-encapsulated miRNAs are released by trophoblasts after treatment with individual metals or their mixtures; and whether miRNAs in EVs released from metal-treated trophoblasts alter critical functions of neural stem cells. We leverage the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort with prospective assessment of behavioral disinhibition in N=470 children followed to age 48 months. While we propose underlying theoretical pathways, the primary goal is to search for biomarkers of early risk. However, findings may also advance our understanding of molecular pathways that influence neurodevelopmental risk, which will be critical for the development of preventative strategies and possible therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal integrates experimental and clinical research on in utero metal exposures, molecular epigenetic biomarkers of placental origin and neurobehavior to create novel, cutting edge cross disciplinary research on neuroprogramming. This is a significant research advance that has the potential to identify early pregnancy biomarkers of placental/fetal health and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms that identify those at heightened risk from environmental exposures, so that interventions may be applied early to promote optimal development and improved health.",Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs,9765987,R01ES030302,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Arsenic', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cadmium', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Encapsulated', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Diseases', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manganese', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Physiology', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Temperament', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxin', 'Transfection', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'behavioral disinhibition', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'early pregnancy', 'epigenetic marker', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'loss of function', 'metal poisoning', 'nanosized', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'overexpression', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal risk factor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'statistics', 'stem cell differentiation', 'tool', 'toxic metal', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment strategy', 'trophoblast', 'vesicular release']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,646285,415711940,-0.015022138852418754
"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the placenta is critical for fetal development and pregnancy outcome, it is not currently accessible for real-time diagnostics throughout pregnancy. Having developed tools for isolation and analysis of placenta- specific extracellular from the maternal plasma, we will study molecular and biophysical properties of these vesicles as indicators of placental health and disease.",Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury,9701262,R01HD086325,"['Abruptio Placentae', 'Acoustics', 'Apoptotic', 'Arteries', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endoglin', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetal Tissues', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Glean', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lab-On-A-Chips', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Nutrient', 'PGF gene', 'Pathology', 'Perinatal', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Biology', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A', 'Premature Birth', 'Production', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Research Institute', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Uterus', 'Venipunctures', 'Vesicle', 'Viscosity', 'Woman', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'biophysical techniques', 'circular RNA', 'clinical care', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost effective', 'design', 'exosome', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fitness', 'guided inquiry', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mechanical properties', 'microvesicles', 'multidimensional data', 'nanofabrication', 'nanomechanics', 'nanovesicle', 'novel', 'perinatal medicine', 'peripheral blood', 'pregnancy disorder', 'preservation', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'stem', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trophoblast', 'viscoelasticity', 'wasting']",NICHD,MAGEE-WOMEN'S RES INST AND FOUNDATION,R01,2019,650539,28472699,0.06628969598245422
"ChartGlucose4Moms: Characterizing, by Trimester, Continuous Glucose Monitoring Measurements for determining effects on Maternal & Offspring Metabolic Sequelae PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Gestational diabetes (GDM) rates are on the rise in the US, particularly among racial and ethnic minorities. GDM is associated with higher rates of large for gestational age (LGA) infants, C-section, and serious perinatal complications, and increased long-term risks of Type 2 diabetes and morbidity in both mothers and infants. Women who get treatment for GDM are less likely to experience perinatal complications and give birth to LGA infants than those who do not; therefore, rapid detection of GDM may be critical to reducing perinatal complications and disparities in birth outcomes. GDM is normally diagnosed by oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) at 24-28 weeks gestation, but clinically important insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction may be missed by not testing earlier. A metabolically unhealthy uterine environment in early pregnancy may lead to long-term negative impacts on mother and child, but how and when to test for insulin resistance and associated metabolic dysfunction in pregnancy is poorly defined. More data are needed on how glucose levels and other metabolic measures change across pregnancy to better evaluate women's metabolic risks and how those risks relate to perinatal and long-term outcomes. Using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and metabolic biomarker assays, we will describe detailed metabolic phenotype profiles over the course of pregnancy and examine how they are associated with perinatal and postpartum outcomes. We propose to recruit a diverse sample of 400 women in their first trimester from Kaiser Permanente Northwest and Kaiser Permanente Hawaii and to perform CGM, OGTT, and obtain biomarkers at 12 weeks, 20 weeks, and 28 weeks of gestation to examine how these measures relate to each other and to perinatal outcomes. Aim 1 and Aim 3 will assess the effects of CGM variables (Aim 1) and OGTT and other biomarkers (Aim 3) at each time point on the risk of LGA, other perinatal outcomes, and postpartum diabetes. Aim 2 will assess the relationship between CGM variables and diagnosis of GDM by OGTT, as well as the relationship between CGM variables and other metabolic biomarkers. We hypothesize that dysglycemia is just one marker of a much larger metabolic dysregulation that can be characterized through the work of this consortium. Characterizing a broader spectrum of metabolic dysregulation and its association with adverse perinatal outcomes will lead to improved screening regimens and treatments for pregnant women and better outcomes for both mothers and babies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy that increases the risk of pregnancy and birth complications. New tests may allow doctors to identify women with GDM earlier and more accurately than the tests currently being used, but we need to understand them better. We will recruit 400 pregnant women and screen them using both traditional and new GDM screening tools at 12, 20, and 28 weeks of pregnancy to determine how well these tools identify women who are at risk of complications and need treatment.","ChartGlucose4Moms: Characterizing, by Trimester, Continuous Glucose Monitoring Measurements for determining effects on Maternal & Offspring Metabolic Sequelae",9900630,U01DK123791,"['Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brachial plexus structure', 'C-Peptide', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cesarean section', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dystocia', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Fasting', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Fracture', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Gestational Diabetes', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypertriglyceridemia', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nonesterified Fatty Acids', 'OGTT', 'Oral Diagnosis', 'Organogenesis', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnant Women', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Shoulder', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Triglycerides', 'Uterus', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biomarker identification', 'delivery complications', 'early pregnancy', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'fetal', 'glucose monitor', 'high risk', 'improved', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'mortality', 'neonatal death', 'obesogenic', 'offspring', 'perinatal complications', 'perinatal outcomes', 'polypeptide C', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'primary outcome', 'racial minority', 'rapid detection', 'recruit', 'reproductive', 'screening', 'stillbirth', 'tool']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U01,2019,800511,111231681,0.06765803981518179
"A Platform for Safe, Noninvasive Prenatal Genetic Testing at Five Weeks of Pregnancy The purpose of this research is to provide a flexible prenatal genetic testing product that can be expanded to detect any inheritable trait as early as 5, and up to 20, weeks of gestation, from a safe, noninvasive Pap smear. Published studies, as well as our own experience, show that perinatal Pap collections using a cervical cytobrush pose no risk to mother or fetus, and captures trophoblast cells that migrate from the placenta into the reproductive tract. Trophoblast retrieval and isolation from the cervix (TRIC) efficiently isolates hundreds of trophoblast cells without limitations due to early gestational age, maternal obesity, or uteroplacental insufficiency disorders. In our report published in Science Translational Medicine, we isolated sufficient genomic DNA from intact fetal trophoblast cells obtained by TRIC at 5-19 weeks of gestation (n=20) to definitively distinguish maternal and fetal DNA by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of short terminal repeats (STRs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Compared to massively parallel sequencing of cell-free fetal DNA from maternal serum, which has a fetal fraction of only 4-10% at week 10 of gestation, the complete genome obtained by TRIC has a fetal fraction of 85-100%, and provides nucleotide-specific haplotyping. In our Phase I award, we developed this technology for prenatal genotyping of single gene disorders located on the hemoglobin B (HBB) gene, using custom multiplex PCR amplification of SNPs, STRs and loci across HBB for NGS. We successfully haplotyped the locus for the sickle cell disease (SCD) point mutation and genotyped the remainder of the HBB exome, which includes alternate SCD loci, beta thalassemias and anemias. In Phase II, we will expand the test to include HBA1 and HBA1 genes (alpha thalassemias) to provide a comprehensive hemoglobinopathy screen. Phase I studies revealed that genotyping was consistently accurate, unless cervical specimen collection was suboptimal and <40 trophoblast cells were isolated. Commercialization will require operators to obtain adequate specimens. We will accomplish six milestones towards commercialization of this test: 1. Incorporate the HBA1 and HBA2 loci into a comprehensive hemoglobinopathy test. 2. Optimize success rates through operator training and innovations in collection device designs to increase cervical cell recoveries. 3. Innovate a novel alternative method to cytobrush-based cervical collection. 4. Automate the TRIC processing pipeline for high throughput cell isolation, DNA purification and NGS. 5. Establish sample quality assessment tools powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning. 6. Perform a clinical validation trial to assess test performance. With an estimated annual market potential over $284 million for prenatal hemoglobinopathies testing, the envisioned technology will fill an existing gap in clinical diagnostics and outcompete existing invasive prenatal testing. Our initial commercial product will to enable management of high-risk pregnancies and provide valuable information to physicians and patients in the process of establishing families. Specifically, this initial product will benefit pregnancies at risk of having a child with SCA or other hemoglobinopathies such as thalassemia and anemia. This research provides major public health benefits by leveraging a safe, noninvasive method to capture fetal cells that migrate into the reproductive tract from a Pap smear for development of genetic tests to identify women carrying a fetus with an inherited disorder. We will build a DNA sequencing kit that can be commercialized to determine the genotype of fetuses at risk for sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies as early as 5 weeks of pregnancy. Advances emerging from the proposed research will generate new clinical tools for managing pregnancy complications to benefit the well-being of mothers and their babies.","A Platform for Safe, Noninvasive Prenatal Genetic Testing at Five Weeks of Pregnancy",9776011,R44HD092205,"['African American', 'Amniocentesis', 'Anemia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Automation', 'Award', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Cervical', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Child', 'Chorion', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Conceptions', 'Conceptus', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA purification', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genotype', 'Germ Cells', 'Gestational Age', 'Growth', 'Haplotypes', 'Health Benefit', 'Healthcare', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hemoglobinopathies', 'Hereditary Disease', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Mutation', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nucleotides', 'Other Genetics', 'Pap smear', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Placenta', 'Point Mutation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Short Tandem Repeat', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specimen', 'Speculums', 'Technology', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thalassemia', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Vagina', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'alpha-Thalassemia', 'base', 'beta Thalassemia', 'cell free fetal DNA', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically relevant', 'commercialization', 'exome', 'experience', 'fetal', 'fetal diagnosis', 'fetus at risk', 'fetus cell', 'flexibility', 'hemoglobin B', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'maternal obesity', 'maternal serum', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'operation', 'performance tests', 'perinatal health', 'phase 1 study', 'prenatal', 'prenatal testing', 'reproductive', 'reproductive tract', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'testing services', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational medicine', 'trophoblast']",NICHD,"CRADLE GENOMICS, INC.",R44,2019,1098375,901625,0.011446213577113059
"Hypertensive Medication Adherence in Young African American Women Project Abstract Uncontrolled hypertension [HTN] due to poor blood pressure [BP] medication adherence in young and early middle age African American [AA] women is a leading contributor for the sustained hypertension disparities in the US. AA women in the US 20-44 years of age, have the highest prevalence of Hypertension [HTN] when compared to White women of the same age group. Uncontrolled HTN is a significant risk factor for stroke, heart failure, kidney disease, and early mortality, especially in this at-risk group. Barriers prohibiting BP medication adherence have been well characterized across the AA population except in young AA women who bear an unequal and different burden of stressors than older AA women. However, important underlying factors including HTN illness perceptions/representations, unique psychosocial factors including resilient coping, and their influence on good BP medication adherence have not been sufficiently studied among this vulnerable group. Evidence indicating that AAs acquire HTN at younger ages, are less adherent, and are more resistant to treatment compared to other ethnic groups provides a compelling impetus to identify positive and modifiable factors that contribute to BP medication adherence. The specific aims of this cross-sectional dissertation study are to examine the relationships among sociodemographic & clinical profiles, HTN illness perceptions, and BP medication adherence; and examine the relationships between psychosocial factors, resilient coping style, and BP medication adherence when controlling for sociodemographic factors in a sample of young hypertensive AA women. An exploratory aim will examine the relationship of resilient coping as a potential moderator of high or low adverse stress exposure and its effect on BP medication adherence to elicit understanding of variability in BP medication adherence among this subgroup of hypertensive women. A total of 110 AA women diagnosed with HTN, 18-45 years of age, will be recruited through an ongoing community health heart screening project which is targeting AA women diagnosed with HTN, at-risk for HTN, and other cardiovascular disease risk factors in a large southern urban setting. Descriptive, bivariate correlation, and logistic regression will be used for statistical analysis of the aims. Completion of the proposed study is the first step towards understanding the impact of modifiable factors such as HTN illness perceptions and resilient coping, and their impact on BP medication adherence in this vulnerable population. This study will provide important data to inform development and testing of effective and targeted interventions to reduce HTN disparities while improving health outcomes in a population predisposed to adverse cardiovascular events. Project Narrative Young and early middle age adult AA women represent a growing group of ethnic minority women diagnosed with hypertension in the United States. This study will examine novel constructs (HTN illness Perceptions and Resilient Coping) and psychosocial factors in relation to hypertension medication adherence to determine their importance in facilitating medication adherence in a population for whom limited information is known regarding factors associated with increased levels of medication adherence. Information gained from this study may advance the field of cardiovascular research and ethnic minority hypertension disparities and may help develop culturally targeted interventions to reduce poor medication adherence, thus improving rates of uncontrolled hypertension in the future.",Hypertensive Medication Adherence in Young African American Women,9541705,F31NR017348,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiac health', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Community Health', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Coping Behavior', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'High Prevalence', 'Hypertension', 'Income', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sex Discrimination', 'Single Parent', 'Social Class', 'Social support', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'Stress and Coping', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Support System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Well in self', 'Woman', 'age group', 'associated symptom', 'blood pressure medication', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'coping', 'depressive symptoms', 'effective intervention', 'enhancing factor', 'ethnic minority population', 'high risk', 'illness perceptions', 'improved', 'insight', 'lifestyle factors', 'medication compliance', 'middle age', 'mortality', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'novel', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'racial discrimination', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'response', 'screening', 'socioeconomics', 'stressor', 'success', 'theories', 'urban setting', 'young woman']",NINR,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,44524,507546965,0.03309705239265951
"Understanding Severe Maternal Morbidity: Predictors, Trends, and Disparities PROJECT SUMMARY Severe maternal morbidity (SMM) includes serious threats to maternal health and survival that occur at delivery or postpartum. SMM, which includes postpartum hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, sepsis, and other serious conditions, can be life-threatening and have long-term effects on a woman’s health as well as adversely impact her infant’s health and well-being. Over the past 15 years, the prevalence of SMM has doubled in the U.S., currently affecting more than 65,000 women each year. Additionally, the prevalence of SMM is highest in women of minority races and ethnicities, particularly women who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic. However, the most important risk factors for SMM are not established and it is unknown what is contributing to racial/ethnic disparities and increasing trends in SMM. Our goal is to improve the understanding of SMM and its risk factors to provide evidence that supports efforts to reduce the prevalence of SMM and racial/ethnic disparities in SMM. The proposed project will use linked vital statistics, patient discharge, and U.S. Census data for over 4 million births in California from 2007 to 2014. We will test trends in SMM prevalence and calculate the population attributable risks for three key potential risk factors—advanced maternal age, prepregnancy obesity, and cesarean delivery—and their combination across the years of study (Aim 1). Additionally, we will examine a wide range of potential risk factors to identify those that are most important using a machine-learning/data-adaptive approach (Aim 2). Both study aims will be done in the overall sample and separately in racial/ethnic groups. Understanding SMM trends and determining the strongest predictors of SMM are critical steps to launch forward research of this pressing and understudied public health problem. Many factors may present crucial opportunities to prevent the development severe maternal morbidity—saving the lives of mothers and helping ensure a healthy future for their children. PROJECT NARRATIVE Each year, more and more new mothers are diagnosed with serious pregnancy-related medical conditions, particularly mothers who identify as racial/ethnic minorities. Research is urgently needed to understand what is driving this alarming problem and what puts women most at risk so future research can be conducted to guide interventions and clinical care for childbearing women.","Understanding Severe Maternal Morbidity: Predictors, Trends, and Disparities",9485199,F32HD091945,"['Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cesarean section', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Health', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Age', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Patient Discharge', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Population Attributable Risks', 'Population Study', 'Postpartum Hemorrhage', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Vital Statistics', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'advanced maternal age', 'base', 'child bearing', 'clinical care', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'ethnic minority population', 'improved', 'indexing', 'maternal morbidity', 'outcome prediction', 'prepregnancy', 'prepregnancy obesity', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'social', 'trend']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2018,58392,560644462,0.06413705753892461
"Human Microbiome and Perinatal Depression Project Summary/Abstract Depression is the most common complication of pregnancy and affects 10-20% of women. Up to 75% of women with perinatal depression do not receive mental health care. In lower income African American and Hispanic women, the prevalence of perinatal depression (PND) is particularly high and the treatment rates are lower. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment but practical barriers such as time commitment, insurance coverage, and transportation, as well as stigma, limit uptake of CBT particularly for minority women. Similarly, concern about the adverse effects of antidepressant treatment on maternal and infant outcomes limits uptake of pharmacological treatments. A novel avenue for the development of safe therapeutics for depression focuses on the brain-gut axis and is supported by initial demonstrations that probiotics can improve mood symptoms. Our long-term goal is to assist in the discovery of potential microbes that are correlated with PND, and could be novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of this disorder, particularly in minority women. As a first step, we propose a multi-PI feasibility study involving the implementation and optimization of processes for participant recruitment and stool sample collection, as well as the initial assessments of longitudinal differences in gut microbiota between pregnant women with and without major depressive disorder (MDD). To meet these goals, we will leverage an established research infrastructure to conduct a prospective, nested case-control study. We will prospectively collect depression diagnoses and gut microbiome samples on 300 women at four points during pregnancy and after delivery to yield a total of 58 women, 29 cases with MDD and 29 controls without MDD. The two groups will be matched on key covariates (e.g., age, race, socio- economic status, gestational age, health). At their scheduled usual care, prenatal appointment, consented participants will complete mental health, demographics, microbiome-related, and dietary and physical habits questionnaires and provide a fecal sample either at that time of their appointment or at home. To achieve our first aim - to determine the feasibility of a larger similarly designed study - we will estimate the total number of potential participants, the number assessed and not assessed for eligibility (and reasons), the number excluded and reasons for exclusion, the number lost to follow-up, and the data available for analysis at each of the 4 visits. To achieve our second aim - to determine whether the gut microbiome dynamically differs in pregnant women with and without MDD - we will employ a suite of systems level approaches, including multivariate statistical techniques, network modeling and machine learning techniques. This R03 will allow us to optimize our research processes for the prospective collection of stool samples and mental health data in preparation for larger nested case-control studies, and ultimately clinical trials of probiotic therapies for PND. Project Narrative Up to 75% of women diagnosed with depression during pregnancy and the postpartum receive inadequate treatment, in large part due to concerns about the safety of antidepressants. Here we propose a feasibility study in preparation for a larger study to determine whether women with depression during their pregnancy and after their delivery have alterations in the bacterial communities in their intestine. Identifying which bacteria are associated with depression is a critical first step in the development of safe probiotic treatments for depression during pregnancy. !",Human Microbiome and Perinatal Depression,9507031,R03HD095056,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Appointment', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Endocrine system', 'Epidemiology', 'Exclusion', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feces', 'Germ-Free', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immune system', 'Immunology', 'Infant', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Neurologic', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nutritional', 'Observational Study', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prenatal care', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Probiotics', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'alternative treatment', 'antepartum depression', 'antidepressant effect', 'bacterial community', 'demographics', 'depressive symptoms', 'drug development', 'dysbiosis', 'effective therapy', 'fecal microbiome', 'fecal transplantation', 'follow-up', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'gut-brain axis', 'health data', 'improved', 'infant outcome', 'insight', 'maternal stress', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microorganism', 'mood symptom', 'network models', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'nutrition', 'perinatal mental health', 'peripartum depression', 'probiotic therapy', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample collection', 'social stigma', 'stool sample', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment as usual', 'uptake']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R03,2018,92360,148463823,0.07979822822585153
"Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia PROJECT SUMMARY Preeclampsia (PE) is a devastating hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that is a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity worldwide. It affects 2-10% of women and accounts for 16% of maternal deaths related to childbirth in developed countries. PE is difficult to study because it is a multifactorial disorder with varying molecular mechanisms associated with the development of the spectrum of clinical symptoms associated with early onset, late onset, and severe PE. A personalized medicine approach applied to dissecting the underlying mechanisms of PE may be beneficial to reduce clinical incidence of this devastating syndrome. The placenta plays a key role in the development of PE, leading to widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, and systemic multi-organ failure in PE. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing protein, RNA, and lipid cargo are continuously extruded from the placenta, and are capable of interacting with maternal organs including the kidney. PE is primarily associated with placental and renal dysfunction, and PE is the most common cause of acute kidney injury during pregnancy. However, no studies have investigated the potential of placenta-derived RNA cargo as a link between placental and renal dysfunction in PE. Urinary EVs are derived from multiple tissue types and represent a trove of biomarkers that are increasingly being utilized to diagnose renal disorders. Further, urine samples can be obtained throughout pregnancy non-invasively and could potentially be utilized to identify biomarkers related to placental dysfunction in PE. In the proposed research, during the mentored phase, cutting-edge RNA-Seq technology coupled with computational biological and machine learning approaches will be applied to profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs in women with PE compared to normal pregnancy. Preliminary data indicates that it is possible to isolate and profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs from maternal urine throughout normal gestation, and that placenta-derived and placenta-specific mRNA and miRNA can be detected within the urinary EV population. This presents a novel technique that has potential to identify biomarkers as well as provide information on placental dysfunction in PE in a non-invasive manner. During the independent phase, the candidate will utilize an in vitro approach to investigate the effect of uptake of placenta-derived EVs with miRNA cargo associated with PE on the function of proximal tubule epithelial cells and cortical collecting duct cells. These two renal-specific cell types are involved in tubular reabsorption in the nephron, a process that is compromised leading to increased excretion of protein in the urine in some preeclamptic pregnancies. This proposal is multidisciplinary, utilizing basic biology, clinical research, and high-performance computing applied to investigating placental dysfunction in PE. These experiments are significant because they will generate novel information on the role of placenta- derived EVs in renal dysfunction in PE, as well as point the way towards preventative and therapeutic targets that may be transformative and clinically relevant. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will examine the transcriptome of urinary extracellular vesicles obtained non-invasively as a source of placenta-derived nucleic acids reflective of the development of preeclampsia (PE), and will con- duct in vitro experiments to determine the role of placental extracellular vesicles in renal dysfunction in PE.",Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia,9583334,K99HD096125,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Apoptosis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Childbirth', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Ductal Epithelial Cell', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Excretory function', 'Failure', 'Fetal Mortality Statistics', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypoxia', 'Immune response', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Nephrons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Organ', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Phase', 'Placenta', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Small RNA', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Tubular formation', 'Urine', 'Woman', 'associated symptom', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'early onset', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'experimental study', 'extracellular vesicles', 'improved', 'innovation', 'maternal serum', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal morbidity', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pregnancy disorder', 'premature', 'prevent', 'response', 'stillbirth', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'uptake', 'urinary']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,K99,2018,104534,76545728,0.043273479825071744
"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9514218,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'imaging study', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive signature', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2018,182298,673201228,0.048775346592373606
"Immune response to Zika infection at the primate maternal-fetal interface ABSTRACT Infection with Zika virus (ZIKV), first linked with an increased incidence of microcephaly in Brazil, is now associated with a spectrum of fetal and postnatal malformations and developmental disorders. Our previous studies with rhesus macaques have demonstrated that, like the human population, severe fetal outcomes are uncommon, but they have also revealed that vertical transmission of ZIKV to the fetus may more common than is currently appreciated, with 100% transmission to fetuses when dams were inoculated in the first or third trimester. Additional neurological deficits from intrauterine infection are now becoming revealed in postnatal life, thus a better understanding of the correlates of vertical transmission at the maternal-fetal interface is critical. Investigators at the University of Wisconsin-Madison are funded to conduct a study to define the viral persistence and distribution in maternal tissues of pregnant rhesus macaques at staged intervals following infection with ZIKV. That study specifically will evaluate maternal tissues, but does not support concurrent evaluation of the maternal-fetal interface. We hypothesize that the antiviral response in the decidua and placenta can determine the risk for vertical transmission of the virus and the degree of fetal pathology and developmental dysregulation. To address this hypothesis, we propose to comprehensively define the immune response at the maternal-fetal interface in these pregnancies in two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To define the T cell, antigen-presenting cell, and innate lymphoid/natural killer cell populations in control and ZIKV-infected decidua, establishing their transcriptional, secreted, and cell-surface profiles with high-dimensional flow cytometry and dimension reduction methodologies. Specific Aim 2. To define the Hofbauer cell surface, secreted, and activation profiles in control and ZIKV- infected placentas. We will use high-dimensional flow cytometric analytical methods established in our laboratories for human decidual leukocytes, guided by our previous work with rhesus decidual leukocytes and placental Hofbauer cells, comparing infected pregnancies with control pregnancies to be supported by this R21 proposal. The ZIKV- infected decidual and placental immunome will be interpreted in light of the distribution, burden, and pathogenic impact of ZIKV replication in the decidua and the fetus. A clearer understanding of the decidual and placental immune response with ZIKV infection, which we can couple with determination of fetal infection and pathology to be gained from the current study, will allow insight into the correlates of decidual and placental immune responses of fetal outcomes. Project Narrative: Infection of pregnant women with Zika virus has been implicated in an increase in the incidence of microcephaly in Brazil, as well as other fetal pathologies of the developing nervous system. It is not understood whether the immune response of the maternal reproductive tract or the fetal placenta itself can mitigate against the risk for fetal developmental outcomes. The nonhuman primate offers an outstanding opportunity to determine if a local response against Zika infection at the maternal-fetal interface can provide insight into developing interventions to interrupt these devastating fetal outcomes once maternal infection has occurred.",Immune response to Zika infection at the primate maternal-fetal interface,9444928,R21AI136014,"['Address', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antiviral Response', 'Autopsy', 'Brazil', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Decidua', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Membranes', 'Fetal Monitoring', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Lymphoid', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Methodology', 'Microcephaly', 'Modeling', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Optic Nerve', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Placenta', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Risk', 'Specimen', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Vertical Disease Transmission', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Viremia', 'Virus Replication', 'Visual system structure', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'ZIKV infection', 'Zika Virus', 'analytical method', 'base', 'co-infection', 'density', 'developmental disease', 'fetal', 'fetal infection', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'malformation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'pregnant', 'reproductive tract', 'response', 'segregation', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'transcriptome', 'transmission process', 'viral transmission', 'virtual', 'virus genetics']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2018,229500,338121506,0.009507449012772328
"Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is a stigmatized, underreported, under-diagnosed, under-treated yet common condition that negatively impacts quality of life of many older adults. UUI symptoms overlap with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI), the most common infection in older adults and UUI is associated with an increased risk of UTI in both men and women. Overall success with current UUI treatment modalities remains poor and short-term. Vitamin D supplementation is a plausible intervention for UUI and UTI prevention, but few studies have examined associations between vitamin D levels and UUI and UTI. Vitamin D may influence detrusor muscle contraction by activating vitamin D receptors present in detrusor muscle and blocking the RhoA/Rho-associated kinase, a calcium-independent pathway for smooth muscle contraction. Vitamin D also stimulates production of antimicrobial peptides, which inhibit growth of bladder bacteria that may confer risk for or protection from UUI and UTI. It is now known that urine is not sterile, and that standard urine cultures fail to detect most urinary bacteria (microbiome) regardless of the amount. Present in men and women, the urinary microbiome likely influences bladder health. This study will examine the associations between vitamin D levels, the urinary microbiome, and UUI and UTI risk in both men and women across four racial/ethnic groups. To achieve this goal, the Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a large racially diverse cohort of adults followed longitudinally to determine the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease and its progression. At the upcoming 15-year follow-up exam, the mean age of MESA participants will be 70-75 years; in this age group, UUI prevalence exceeds 30% in women and 15% in men. We propose to investigate the association of both current UUI status and future UTI with vitamin D and the urinary microbiome and create prediction models that incorporate both traditional (e.g. obesity, diabetes) and novel (vitamin D and urinary microbiome) risk factors for the identification of individuals at high risk or UUI and UTI. The long-term goal is to design innovative clinical trials to mitigate and prevent UUI and UTI in older men and women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine accompanied by a strong and urgent desire to urinate and is associated with increased risk of urinary tract infections (UTI), the second most frequent infection among older adults. UUI is extremely common among older men and women and current treatments are not successful in most patients. The Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use an existing racially/ethnically diverse and clinically well-characterized cohort to investigate the association of current UUI status and future UTI with risk factors, both established (e.g., obesity and diabetes) and novel (i.e., vitamin D and the urinary microbiome) and create prediction models that identify individuals at high risk for UUI and UTI.

"Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of cervical remodeling during pregnancy and labor is incomplete, partly due to the lack of in vivo studies on the biochemical changes that occur in the cervix over the course of pregnancy. Elucidation of the mechanisms for cervical ripening could be used to predict the onset of preterm labor. Until recently, in vivo research methods were too invasive to be used as discovery tools, particularly in women who present with preterm labor. This proposal will use in vivo Raman spectroscopy, an optical technique that is sensitive to collagen content, collagen structure, hydration, lipids, proteins, ad other biomolecules to non-invasively investigate the biochemistry of the cervix throughout pregnancy. Using fiber optic in vivo Raman spectroscopy, we recently found significant differences in Raman spectra in at least four important peaks during the course of pregnancy in mice, including discrete signatures for lipids, collagen, amide bonds, and enriched amino acids (proline, tyrosine). Computational analysis of these spectra yielded predictive algorithms with 94% classification accuracy for stage of pregnancy. Studies performed in 2-hour windows at the end of pregnancy identified spectra predictive for the timing of parturition. This approach provides a detailed real-time biomolecular map of cervical ripening that is currently unavailable by other means. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the different mechanisms of premature cervical ripening have unique Raman spectral signatures that correspond to underlying biochemical and mechanical changes that precede preterm birth, which can be detected in vivo. Two Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Determine spectral changes in the cervix of mice with normal and abnormal pregnancy and parturition; 2) Identify specific mediators of cervical remodeling by comparing Raman spectra to mechanical and biochemical changes in the ex vivo cervix during normal and abnormal parturition. Raman spectroscopy has primarily been used for detection of disease. Collaboration between our reproductive biology and bioengineering groups will capitalize on our expertise in Raman analysis of cervical tissues to study dynamic changes in cervix composition during pregnancy. Key elements in cervical biochemistry will be identified. In vivo Raman spectroscopy will be combined with biomechanical studies and imaging mass spectrometry, a powerful tool for in situ proteomic analysis, to examine mice with premature or delayed cervical remodeling. Together, these highly innovative approaches will generate in-depth profiles of cervical biology that will translate into novel non-invasive methods to detect impending premature birth in women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will use Raman Spectroscopy, a non-invasive, optical scattering technique, to investigate the composition of the cervix throughout pregnancy and provide detailed real-time information on cervical ripening. These studies will identify spectral differences in the cervix during normal and abnormal cervical maturation; optical and biochemical markers will be identified to help monitor pregnancy non-invasively, as the fiber optic probe only requires brief contact with the external surface of the cervix to obtain measurements. Elucidating the mechanisms that initiate cervical ripening will provide a critical step for early detection and treatment of preterm birth, which is the leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality.",Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy,9505946,R01HD081121,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alprostadil', 'Amides', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Birth', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Ripening', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elasticity', 'Elements', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Etiology', 'Fetal Development', 'Fiber Optics', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Hormonal', 'Hour', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impairment', 'In Situ', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mifepristone', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Optics', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Labor', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proline', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Reproductive Biology', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Tyrosine', 'Woman', 'base', 'clinical application', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity/mortality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'physical science', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnant', 'premature', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,387714,377931988,0.05834435532949888
"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes.

"Understanding Severe Maternal Morbidity: Predictors, Trends, and Disparities PROJECT SUMMARY Severe maternal morbidity (SMM) includes serious threats to maternal health and survival that occur at delivery or postpartum. SMM, which includes postpartum hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, sepsis, and other serious conditions, can be life-threatening and have long-term effects on a woman’s health as well as adversely impact her infant’s health and well-being. Over the past 15 years, the prevalence of SMM has doubled in the U.S., currently affecting more than 65,000 women each year. Additionally, the prevalence of SMM is highest in women of minority races and ethnicities, particularly women who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic. However, the most important risk factors for SMM are not established and it is unknown what is contributing to racial/ethnic disparities and increasing trends in SMM. Our goal is to improve the understanding of SMM and its risk factors to provide evidence that supports efforts to reduce the prevalence of SMM and racial/ethnic disparities in SMM. The proposed project will use linked vital statistics, patient discharge, and U.S. Census data for over 4 million births in California from 2007 to 2014. We will test trends in SMM prevalence and calculate the population attributable risks for three key potential risk factors—advanced maternal age, prepregnancy obesity, and cesarean delivery—and their combination across the years of study (Aim 1). Additionally, we will examine a wide range of potential risk factors to identify those that are most important using a machine-learning/data-adaptive approach (Aim 2). Both study aims will be done in the overall sample and separately in racial/ethnic groups. Understanding SMM trends and determining the strongest predictors of SMM are critical steps to launch forward research of this pressing and understudied public health problem. Many factors may present crucial opportunities to prevent the development severe maternal morbidity—saving the lives of mothers and helping ensure a healthy future for their children. PROJECT NARRATIVE Each year, more and more new mothers are diagnosed with serious pregnancy-related medical conditions, particularly mothers who identify as racial/ethnic minorities. Research is urgently needed to understand what is driving this alarming problem and what puts women most at risk so future research can be conducted to guide interventions and clinical care for childbearing women.","Understanding Severe Maternal Morbidity: Predictors, Trends, and Disparities",9327774,F32HD091945,"['Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cesarean section', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Health', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Age', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Patient Discharge', 'Population', 'Population Attributable Risks', 'Population Study', 'Postpartum Hemorrhage', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Vital Statistics', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'advanced maternal age', 'base', 'child bearing', 'clinical care', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'ethnic minority population', 'improved', 'indexing', 'maternal morbidity', 'outcome prediction', 'prepregnancy obesity', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'social', 'trend']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2017,56334,560644462,0.06413705753892461
"Vaccine Development for Falciparum Malaria in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes more than one million deaths annually. Young children in malaria endemic areas of Africa have the highest mortality because of their immature immune systems. Global efforts to control the disease have had limited success and no vaccine has yet been approved for clinical use. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to discover new vaccine candidates using novel approaches, especially for mothers and infants who represent key target groups. Dr. Michelow's research goal for the proposed Mentored Career Development Award is to discover new anti-malarial vaccines for women of childbearing age in order to protect their highly vulnerable offspring from severe or fatal malaria in early infancy. Under the mentorship of Drs. Kurtis and Friedman from Brown University, and Drs. Duffy and Fried from the NIH/NIAID Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology, who are internationally renowned investigators, he plans to test the hypothesis that novel vaccine targets can be discovered by identifying transplacentally acquired malarial antibodies that mediate infants' resistance to severe or fatal malaria. The objective of this proposal is to identify conserved Plasmodium falciparum antigens that are uniquely recognized by IgG antibodies in venous blood obtained at delivery from mothers whose infants survived their first year of life with mild or no clinical malaria, but that are not recognized by IgG antibodies from mothers whose infants suffered severe disease or death due to malaria. Dr. Michelow's team will capitalize on plasma samples and epidemiological data that they already collected from a large well-characterized longitudinal cohort in Muheza, Tanzania (n=739). In order to achieve these objectives, they propose three Specific Aims that are directed at 1) discovering, 2) validating and 3) downselecting P. falciparum candidate vaccine antigens. The strength of this patient-oriented translational strategy derives from the fact that they will use plasma of mothers and infants with naturally acquired malarial antibodies at the earliest stage of vaccine epitope discovery. Based on the successful approach pioneered by Dr. Kurtis, they will perform a differential high throughput whole proteome screen on select groups of pooled plasma from mothers of infants with severe malaria vs. mothers of infants with mild or no malaria. They will use a newly produced P. falciparum (3D7) malaria genomic DNA T7 phage display library as well as a wild type blood-stage complementary DNA T7 phage library for this purpose. Candidate vaccine antigens will then be validated by testing a large independent cohort of mothers and infants from the same population to determine which specific malarial antibodies most reliably predict better malaria outcomes. They will employ mixed effects logistic regression modeling to account for repeated measures and confounding variables as well as the Cox proportional hazards survival model to compare time to predefined endpoints. Lead candidate antigens will then be downselected using bioinformatics and surface localization studies, as well as functional evaluations, using invasion and growth inhibition assays for blood stage candidates. Dr. Michelow's previous clinical training in Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, his research on diagnostic tests for children with pneumonia or congenital syphilis, and his laboratory work on production of novel immunotherapeutics for glycosylated virus infections, have laid a solid foundation for his proposed research project. Under the guidance of his mentors, he will bridge the gap between basic science and patient-oriented research by applying rigorous, mechanistic and creative methods of enquiry to translate basic science concepts into relevant human interventions and therapies. He plans to accomplish his goals by acquiring critical new skills in the following three key areas: 1) vaccine immunology, 2) advanced molecular methods, and 3) applied biostatistics, epidemiology and human population research. Specifically, he will be trained in methods to implement innovative phage-based molecular screening strategies, select and test optimal malaria vaccine epitopes, cultivate and genetically manipulate malaria parasites, perform cell-based infection assays, interrogate the malaria genome/proteome databases, use sophisticated cell imaging technologies, model complex data using advanced statistical methods to account for confounding variables and repeated measures, and reinforce importance of bioethical issues. The proposed research experiences will prepare Dr. Michelow to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming a skilled investigator in hypothesis-driven translational research in the field of malaria vaccine discovery. One or more rationally identified lead candidate vaccine epitopes from the current proposal will form the basis of his R01 application. His objectives will be to 1) confirm the relevance of the antigen/s derived from native P. falciparum strains from Tanzania, 2) conduct animal studies to study effectiveness and mechanisms of action of new vaccines, and 3) establish a Phase I healthy human volunteer vaccine study. Dr. Michelow and his team of highly accomplished investigators are committed to the mission of developing new effective malaria vaccines using creative strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes the highest mortality in African children. This research aims to develop an effective new malaria vaccine to protect infants by taking advantage of maternal antibodies that cross the placenta. Candidate vaccine proteins will be screened, confirmed and selected for clinical trials using pioneering molecular tools and blood samples from pregnant African women and their infants.",Vaccine Development for Falciparum Malaria in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring,9293966,K08AI100997,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'African', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody titer measurement', 'Antigens', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Bacteriophage T7', 'Bacteriophages', 'Basic Science', 'Bioethical Issues', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood group antigen S', 'Blood specimen', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Complementary DNA', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Congenital Syphilis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Female of child bearing age', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Volunteers', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunologic Epidemiology', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'In Vitro', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'International', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Maternal antibody', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parasitemia', 'Parasites', 'Phage Display', 'Phase', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Pregnant Women', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Tanzania', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Tropical Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccines', 'Venous', 'Virus Diseases', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'cellular imaging', 'cohort', 'disorder control', 'epidemiologic data', 'experience', 'hazard', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant death', 'infant outcome', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel vaccines', 'offspring', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'pregnant', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'translational approach', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine discovery', 'vaccine trial', 'vaccine-induced immunity', 'vaccinology']",NIAID,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,K08,2017,165996,37921345,0.05140190554933966
"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9354508,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'imaging study', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive signature', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'therapy development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2017,201353,673201228,0.048775346592373606
"Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is a stigmatized, underreported, under-diagnosed, under-treated yet common condition that negatively impacts quality of life of many older adults. UUI symptoms overlap with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI), the most common infection in older adults and UUI is associated with an increased risk of UTI in both men and women. Overall success with current UUI treatment modalities remains poor and short-term. Vitamin D supplementation is a plausible intervention for UUI and UTI prevention, but few studies have examined associations between vitamin D levels and UUI and UTI. Vitamin D may influence detrusor muscle contraction by activating vitamin D receptors present in detrusor muscle and blocking the RhoA/Rho-associated kinase, a calcium-independent pathway for smooth muscle contraction. Vitamin D also stimulates production of antimicrobial peptides, which inhibit growth of bladder bacteria that may confer risk for or protection from UUI and UTI. It is now known that urine is not sterile, and that standard urine cultures fail to detect most urinary bacteria (microbiome) regardless of the amount. Present in men and women, the urinary microbiome likely influences bladder health. This study will examine the associations between vitamin D levels, the urinary microbiome, and UUI and UTI risk in both men and women across four racial/ethnic groups. To achieve this goal, the Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a large racially diverse cohort of adults followed longitudinally to determine the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease and its progression. At the upcoming 15-year follow-up exam, the mean age of MESA participants will be 70-75 years; in this age group, UUI prevalence exceeds 30% in women and 15% in men. We propose to investigate the association of both current UUI status and future UTI with vitamin D and the urinary microbiome and create prediction models that incorporate both traditional (e.g. obesity, diabetes) and novel (vitamin D and urinary microbiome) risk factors for the identification of individuals at high risk or UUI and UTI. The long-term goal is to design innovative clinical trials to mitigate and prevent UUI and UTI in older men and women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine accompanied by a strong and urgent desire to urinate and is associated with increased risk of urinary tract infections (UTI), the second most frequent infection among older adults. UUI is extremely common among older men and women and current treatments are not successful in most patients. The Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use an existing racially/ethnically diverse and clinically well-characterized cohort to investigate the association of current UUI status and future UTI with risk factors, both established (e.g., obesity and diabetes) and novel (i.e., vitamin D and the urinary microbiome) and create prediction models that identify individuals at high risk for UUI and UTI.

"Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of cervical remodeling during pregnancy and labor is incomplete, partly due to the lack of in vivo studies on the biochemical changes that occur in the cervix over the course of pregnancy. Elucidation of the mechanisms for cervical ripening could be used to predict the onset of preterm labor. Until recently, in vivo research methods were too invasive to be used as discovery tools, particularly in women who present with preterm labor. This proposal will use in vivo Raman spectroscopy, an optical technique that is sensitive to collagen content, collagen structure, hydration, lipids, proteins, ad other biomolecules to non-invasively investigate the biochemistry of the cervix throughout pregnancy. Using fiber optic in vivo Raman spectroscopy, we recently found significant differences in Raman spectra in at least four important peaks during the course of pregnancy in mice, including discrete signatures for lipids, collagen, amide bonds, and enriched amino acids (proline, tyrosine). Computational analysis of these spectra yielded predictive algorithms with 94% classification accuracy for stage of pregnancy. Studies performed in 2-hour windows at the end of pregnancy identified spectra predictive for the timing of parturition. This approach provides a detailed real-time biomolecular map of cervical ripening that is currently unavailable by other means. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the different mechanisms of premature cervical ripening have unique Raman spectral signatures that correspond to underlying biochemical and mechanical changes that precede preterm birth, which can be detected in vivo. Two Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Determine spectral changes in the cervix of mice with normal and abnormal pregnancy and parturition; 2) Identify specific mediators of cervical remodeling by comparing Raman spectra to mechanical and biochemical changes in the ex vivo cervix during normal and abnormal parturition. Raman spectroscopy has primarily been used for detection of disease. Collaboration between our reproductive biology and bioengineering groups will capitalize on our expertise in Raman analysis of cervical tissues to study dynamic changes in cervix composition during pregnancy. Key elements in cervical biochemistry will be identified. In vivo Raman spectroscopy will be combined with biomechanical studies and imaging mass spectrometry, a powerful tool for in situ proteomic analysis, to examine mice with premature or delayed cervical remodeling. Together, these highly innovative approaches will generate in-depth profiles of cervical biology that will translate into novel non-invasive methods to detect impending premature birth in women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will use Raman Spectroscopy, a non-invasive, optical scattering technique, to investigate the composition of the cervix throughout pregnancy and provide detailed real-time information on cervical ripening. These studies will identify spectral differences in the cervix during normal and abnormal cervical maturation; optical and biochemical markers will be identified to help monitor pregnancy non-invasively, as the fiber optic probe only requires brief contact with the external surface of the cervix to obtain measurements. Elucidating the mechanisms that initiate cervical ripening will provide a critical step for early detection and treatment of preterm birth, which is the leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality.",Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy,9443649,R01HD081121,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alprostadil', 'Amides', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Birth', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Ripening', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elasticity', 'Elements', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Etiology', 'Fetal Development', 'Fiber Optics', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Hormonal', 'Hour', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impairment', 'In Situ', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Infant Mortality', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mifepristone', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Optics', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Labor', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proline', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Reproductive Biology', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Tyrosine', 'Woman', 'base', 'clinical application', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'physical science', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnant', 'premature', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,376620,377931988,0.05834435532949888
"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the placenta is critical for fetal development and pregnancy outcome, it is not currently accessible for real-time diagnostics throughout pregnancy.

"Fetal-Maternal Histocompatibility and Autoimmune Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to investigate the potential role of fetal-maternal histocompatibility and other HLA relationships in maternal autoimmune disease. Female predominance, onset during childbearing years, and similarities to graft-versus-host disease have led to the hypothesis that natural processes during pregnancy such as the bi-directional cellular exchange between mother and fetus could be involved in the etiology of some autoimmune conditions. The presence of cells or tissues originating from a different individual is referred to as microchimerism (MC). Studies in scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have found higher number of fetal cells, or MC, in the maternal circulation years after birth compared to healthy controls. Fetal cells could potentially elicit a graft-versus-host or a host-versus-graft effect triggering autoimmune conditions. However, the overall reduction of risk of RA and SLE associated with parity and the amelioration of RA symptoms during pregnancy, suggest that exposure to fetal DNA could also be beneficial. Overall, the exact role of MC in disease etiology remains unknown. Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules play a key role in immunologic function and are important in immune recognition of self and non-self. Histocompatibility relationships are hypothesized to play a role in effect and persistence of fetal cells. The overall hypothesis of this project is tha the nature of the fetal-maternal histocompatibility relationship determines the effect of exposure to fetal cells on risk of disease. This project will use 4-digit HLA genotypes, detailed pregnancy histories, and clinical characteristics abstracted from medical records from ~900 RA cases, SLE cases and healthy controls (300 in each group), 1,500 of their children and 400 fathers to address three related hypotheses. First, cases are more likely to share a larger number of alleles at eight classical HLA loci compared to controls. Case-control differences will be tested using logistic regression, adjusting for known confounders and genetic ancestry. Second, women who do not have increased histocompatibility with any of their offspring have a later age of onset of RA and SLE compared to women who have compatible offspring. Hazard ratios will be estimated using a Cox-proportional hazards model with age of diagnosis as the event of interest. Third, cases are more likely to be HLA similar to their partners than controls since feta loss is associated with increased histocompatibility between mother and child, in addition to increased risk of RA and SLE. We will first estimate the association between reported number of pregnancies resulting in fetal loss and risk of disease. Second, we will measure the degree of genetic similarity between mating partners by estimating a relatedness coefficient R. Fetal-maternal influences mediated through classical HLA genotypes could provide new insight into the etiology of these debilitating conditions and others where pregnancy related factors are suspected.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus are chronic, debilitating autoimmune diseases predominately affecting women of reproductive age. Microchimerism has emerged as a potentially relevant mechanism in disease etiology where fetal-maternal HLA relationships are likely to be involved. Better characterization of the effects of fetal-maternal histocompatibility will provide new information that will aid in our understandin of disease pathogenesis, provide important predictors for disease risk and help develop better therapeutic strategies.            ",Fetal-Maternal Histocompatibility and Autoimmune Disease,9128403,F31AI116064,"['Aborted Fetus', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alleles', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autoimmunity', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'DNA', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fathers', 'Female', 'Fetus', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Hormonal', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Live Birth', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical Records', 'Microchimerism', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Nature', 'Odds Ratio', 'Onset of illness', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatoid Factor', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Scleroderma', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Woman', 'abstracting', 'base', 'carrier status', 'case control', 'cell mediated immune response', 'child bearing', 'cyclic citrullinated peptide', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'fetal', 'fetus cell', 'graft vs host disease', 'hazard', 'insight', 'interest', 'mortality', 'offspring', 'parity', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'risk variant', 'success']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2016,23668,148186688,0.042794624287795145
"Dietary factors and risk of uterine fibroids ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uterine leiomyoma (UL) are the most common pelvic tumor in women of reproductive age. Despite the fact that these smooth muscle tumors are benign, UL are a significant public health problem, accounting for over 200,000 hysterectomies annually, and approximately 1 in 4 women will have a UL that comes to clinical attention. Despite the high morbidity and health care costs associated with UL, the etiology is not understood, and few modifiable, protective risk factors have been identified. Dietary factors may play a role in UL etiology due to their potential to modify endogenous hormones as well as their inflammatory effects. Hypothesis/Specific Aims: Our overall hypothesis is that intake and plasma biomarker levels of dietary components that influence endogenous hormonal and inflammatory response are associated with UL risk. Few studies have examined the association between dietary factors and UL. To our knowledge, only one prospective cohort has examined the association between dairy and dietary fat intake and UL observing a reduced risk of UL with increasing dairy consumption and associations with some fatty acids. In addition, no prospective studies have examined the association with vitamin D levels. Using prospective data we will evaluate the following aims:  Aim 1. Evaluate the association between dietary fat and risk of incident uterine leiomyoma using data among 97,807 women in the NHSII cohort who completed a dietary assessment. In a subset of these women we will examine the association between circulating fatty acid levels and uterine leiomyoma.  Aim 2. Dairy food intake is associated with risk of uterine leiomyoma.  Aim 3. Vitamin D levels are associated with risk of uterine leiomyoma. Study Design: The proposed study consists of Nurses' Health Study II participants who completed a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) about their usual diet in 1991. Follow-up FFQs were completed in 1995, 1999, 2003, and 2007. Quintiles or categories of dietary intake will be generated and Cox proportional hazards models will be used to estimate hazard ratios of UL incidence associated with each of the dietary factors. Among a subset of women with pre-diagnostic biomarkers, the association between plasma vitamin D and circulating fatty acids with UL risk will be assessed with logistic regression models. The presence of prospectively collected UL, dietary, and covariate data and stored blood samples, allows cost-efficient and valid consideration of the temporality of disease diagnosis - supporting the potential identification of modifiable risk factors.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study provides us with the opportunity to examine the association between diet, a potentially modifiable risk factor, and uterine fibroids, a highly prevalent but understudied condition. We believe this study would be the first study to examine the relation between dietary fat intake and vitamin D levels and uterine fibroids. The results of this study have the potential to inform prevention strategies for a condition which accounts for $2.2 billion in health care costs annually.    	            ",Dietary factors and risk of uterine fibroids,9039487,R03HD081064,"['25-hydroxyvitamin D', 'Accounting', 'African American', 'Age', 'Applications Grants', 'Attention', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Categories', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dairy Products', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Dietary Component', 'Dietary Factors', 'Dietary Fats', 'Dietary intake', 'Eating', 'Estrogens', 'Etiology', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fibroid Tumor', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Hysterectomy', 'Immune', 'Incidence', 'Infertility', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intake', 'Interleukin-6', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measurement', 'Milk', 'Modeling', 'Mono-S', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Omega-3 Fatty Acids', 'Participant', 'Pelvic Pain', 'Pelvis', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Smooth Muscle Tumor', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Trans Fats', 'Trans Fatty Acids', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uterine Fibroids', 'Uterine hemorrhage', 'Vitamin D', 'Vitamins', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'calcium intake', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost efficient', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease diagnosis', 'follow-up', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'modifiable risk', 'monounsaturated fat', 'mouse model', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'saturated fat', 'screening', 'steroid hormone', 'study population', 'tumor']",NICHD,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R03,2016,48461,327644200,0.03001708385068419
"Vaccine Development for Falciparum Malaria in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes more than one million deaths annually. Young children in malaria endemic areas of Africa have the highest mortality because of their immature immune systems. Global efforts to control the disease have had limited success and no vaccine has yet been approved for clinical use. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to discover new vaccine candidates using novel approaches, especially for mothers and infants who represent key target groups. Dr. Michelow's research goal for the proposed Mentored Career Development Award is to discover new anti-malarial vaccines for women of childbearing age in order to protect their highly vulnerable offspring from severe or fatal malaria in early infancy. Under the mentorship of Drs. Kurtis and Friedman from Brown University, and Drs. Duffy and Fried from the NIH/NIAID Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology, who are internationally renowned investigators, he plans to test the hypothesis that novel vaccine targets can be discovered by identifying transplacentally acquired malarial antibodies that mediate infants' resistance to severe or fatal malaria. The objective of this proposal is to identify conserved Plasmodium falciparum antigens that are uniquely recognized by IgG antibodies in venous blood obtained at delivery from mothers whose infants survived their first year of life with mild or no clinical malaria, but that are not recognized by IgG antibodies from mothers whose infants suffered severe disease or death due to malaria. Dr. Michelow's team will capitalize on plasma samples and epidemiological data that they already collected from a large well-characterized longitudinal cohort in Muheza, Tanzania (n=739). In order to achieve these objectives, they propose three Specific Aims that are directed at 1) discovering, 2) validating and 3) downselecting P. falciparum candidate vaccine antigens. The strength of this patient-oriented translational strategy derives from the fact that they will use plasma of mothers and infants with naturally acquired malarial antibodies at the earliest stage of vaccine epitope discovery. Based on the successful approach pioneered by Dr. Kurtis, they will perform a differential high throughput whole proteome screen on select groups of pooled plasma from mothers of infants with severe malaria vs. mothers of infants with mild or no malaria. They will use a newly produced P. falciparum (3D7) malaria genomic DNA T7 phage display library as well as a wild type blood-stage complementary DNA T7 phage library for this purpose. Candidate vaccine antigens will then be validated by testing a large independent cohort of mothers and infants from the same population to determine which specific malarial antibodies most reliably predict better malaria outcomes. They will employ mixed effects logistic regression modeling to account for repeated measures and confounding variables as well as the Cox proportional hazards survival model to compare time to predefined endpoints. Lead candidate antigens will then be downselected using bioinformatics and surface localization studies, as well as functional evaluations, using invasion and growth inhibition assays for blood stage candidates. Dr. Michelow's previous clinical training in Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, his research on diagnostic tests for children with pneumonia or congenital syphilis, and his laboratory work on production of novel immunotherapeutics for glycosylated virus infections, have laid a solid foundation for his proposed research project. Under the guidance of his mentors, he will bridge the gap between basic science and patient-oriented research by applying rigorous, mechanistic and creative methods of enquiry to translate basic science concepts into relevant human interventions and therapies. He plans to accomplish his goals by acquiring critical new skills in the following three key areas: 1) vaccine immunology, 2) advanced molecular methods, and 3) applied biostatistics, epidemiology and human population research. Specifically, he will be trained in methods to implement innovative phage-based molecular screening strategies, select and test optimal malaria vaccine epitopes, cultivate and genetically manipulate malaria parasites, perform cell-based infection assays, interrogate the malaria genome/proteome databases, use sophisticated cell imaging technologies, model complex data using advanced statistical methods to account for confounding variables and repeated measures, and reinforce importance of bioethical issues. The proposed research experiences will prepare Dr. Michelow to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming a skilled investigator in hypothesis-driven translational research in the field of malaria vaccine discovery. One or more rationally identified lead candidate vaccine epitopes from the current proposal will form the basis of his R01 application. His objectives will be to 1) confirm the relevance of the antigen/s derived from native P. falciparum strains from Tanzania, 2) conduct animal studies to study effectiveness and mechanisms of action of new vaccines, and 3) establish a Phase I healthy human volunteer vaccine study. Dr. Michelow and his team of highly accomplished investigators are committed to the mission of developing new effective malaria vaccines using creative strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes the highest mortality in African children. This research aims to develop an effective new malaria vaccine to protect infants by taking advantage of maternal antibodies that cross the placenta. Candidate vaccine proteins will be screened, confirmed and selected for clinical trials using pioneering molecular tools and blood samples from pregnant African women and their infants.",Vaccine Development for Falciparum Malaria in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring,9096006,K08AI100997,"['Accounting', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'African', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Bacteriophage T7', 'Bacteriophages', 'Basic Science', 'Bioethical Issues', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Blood typing procedure', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Complementary DNA', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Congenital Syphilis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Female of child bearing age', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Volunteers', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'In Vitro', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Maternal antibody', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parasitemia', 'Parasites', 'Phage Display', 'Phase', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Pregnant Women', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Solid', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Tanzania', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Tropical Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccines', 'Venous', 'Virus Diseases', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'cellular imaging', 'cohort', 'disorder control', 'epidemiologic data', 'experience', 'hazard', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant death', 'infant outcome', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel vaccines', 'offspring', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'pregnant', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'translational approach', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine trial', 'vaccine-induced immunity', 'vaccinology']",NIAID,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,K08,2016,155984,37921345,0.05140190554933966
"Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is a stigmatized, underreported, under-diagnosed, under-treated yet common condition that negatively impacts quality of life of many older adults. UUI symptoms overlap with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI), the most common infection in older adults and UUI is associated with an increased risk of UTI in both men and women. Overall success with current UUI treatment modalities remains poor and short-term. Vitamin D supplementation is a plausible intervention for UUI and UTI prevention, but few studies have examined associations between vitamin D levels and UUI and UTI. Vitamin D may influence detrusor muscle contraction by activating vitamin D receptors present in detrusor muscle and blocking the RhoA/Rho-associated kinase, a calcium-independent pathway for smooth muscle contraction. Vitamin D also stimulates production of antimicrobial peptides, which inhibit growth of bladder bacteria that may confer risk for or protection from UUI and UTI. It is now known that urine is not sterile, and that standard urine cultures fail to detect most urinary bacteria (microbiome) regardless of the amount. Present in men and women, the urinary microbiome likely influences bladder health. This study will examine the associations between vitamin D levels, the urinary microbiome, and UUI and UTI risk in both men and women across four racial/ethnic groups. To achieve this goal, the Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a large racially diverse cohort of adults followed longitudinally to determine the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease and its progression. At the upcoming 15-year follow-up exam, the mean age of MESA participants will be 70-75 years; in this age group, UUI prevalence exceeds 30% in women and 15% in men. We propose to investigate the association of both current UUI status and future UTI with vitamin D and the urinary microbiome and create prediction models that incorporate both traditional (e.g. obesity, diabetes) and novel (vitamin D and urinary microbiome) risk factors for the identification of individuals at high risk or UUI and UTI. The long-term goal is to design innovative clinical trials to mitigate and prevent UUI and UTI in older men and women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine accompanied by a strong and urgent desire to urinate and is associated with increased risk of urinary tract infections (UTI), the second most frequent infection among older adults. UUI is extremely common among older men and women and current treatments are not successful in most patients. The Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use an existing racially/ethnically diverse and clinically well-characterized cohort to investigate the association of current UUI status and future UTI with risk factors, both established (e.g., obesity and diabetes) and novel (i.e., vitamin D and the urinary microbiome) and create prediction models that identify individuals at high risk for UUI and UTI.

"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9197901,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Proxy', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'trafficking', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2016,199585,673201228,0.048775346592373606
"Effectiveness of Treating Prenatal Depression to Reduce Postpartum Depression DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Postpartum depression (PPD) afflicts about 10-15% of pregnant women. Depression during pregnancy is the strongest risk factor for PPD. However, currently, significant confusion exists about whether treating depression during pregnancy could reduce the risk of PPD. Our preliminary studies suggest that treating prenatal depression may reduce PPD risk. To further determine (1) if prenatal depression itself increases the risk of PPD, thus should be treated, (2) if treatment is beneficial, and (3) which treatment is most effective i reducing PPD, we propose to conduct a two-stage prospective cohort study in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). KPNC has implemented a unique universal peripartum depression screening program. All pregnant women (about 33,000 annually) are screened for depression twice during pregnancy and once postpartum using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). During the study period, 120,000 pregnant women who are screened for depression will be included in a peripartum depression screening registry. Using the information on depression status and treatment choices from all 120,000 women (stage-one sample), five cohorts will be formed: (A) ""Untreated cohort"": those who screen positive for depression during pregnancy, but do not receive treatment; (B) "" Psychotherapy cohort"": screen positive and receive psychotherapy only; (C) ""Antidepressant cohort"": screen positive and use antidepressants only; (D) ""Combination treatments cohort"": screen positive and use both psychotherapy and antidepressants; and (E) ""Control cohort"": screen negative for depression and do not receive any treatments. For the stage-two sub-sample, we will randomly select 400 subjects from each of the five cohorts (a total of 2,000 women) and interview them in-person to obtain detailed information on confounders and effect modifiers for adjustment. Comparison of Cohort A versus Cohort E will determine if untreated depression in pregnancy increases the risk of PPD. Comparisons of Cohorts B, C, and D to Cohort A, respectively, will determine the effectiveness of depression treatment. Pair-wise comparisons among Cohorts B, C, and D will determine the comparative effectiveness of various treatment options including psychotherapy, anti-depressants, and combination therapies. Multiple linear regression analyses will be used to examine the treatment effectiveness in improving depression status from during to after pregnancy where within person change in PHQ-9 scores between prenatal and postpartum periods are compared. Logistic regression analyses will be used to examine the treatment effectiveness in reducing PPD risk where PPD risk (a dichotomized variable) is compared among all treatment groups. The findings will provide answers to pressing clinical questions of whether depression in pregnancy should be treated and, if so, which option is the best for reducing PPD. Selecting an effective treatment could lead to a reduction in PPD which remains a leading public health challenge worldwide. The established registry could be a valuable resource for many future studies of long-term effects of depression on maternal health and children's development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will determine whether treating depression during pregnancy would reduce the risk or severity of postparturm depression, and, if so, which treatment option (psychotherapy or antidepressants) is more effective in reducing postpartum depression.",Effectiveness of Treating Prenatal Depression to Reduce Postpartum Depression,9124715,R01HS021515,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2016,499814,111231681,0.060809448341058496
"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the placenta is critical for fetal development and pregnancy outcome, it is not currently accessible for real-time diagnostics throughout pregnancy. Having developed tools for isolation and analysis of placenta- specific extracellular from the maternal plasma, we will study molecular and biophysical properties of these vesicles as indicators of placental health and disease.",Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury,9145745,R01HD086325,"['Abruptio Placentae', 'Acoustics', 'Apoptotic', 'Arteries', 'Bathing', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endoglin', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetal Tissues', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Glean', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Nutrient', 'PGF gene', 'Pathology', 'Perinatal', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A', 'Premature Birth', 'Production', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Research Institute', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Venipunctures', 'Vesicle', 'Viscosity', 'Woman', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'biophysical techniques', 'circular RNA', 'clinical care', 'cost effective', 'design', 'exosome', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fitness', 'guided inquiry', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'innovation', 'micro-total analysis system', 'microvesicles', 'nanofabrication', 'nanomechanics', 'nanovesicle', 'novel', 'perinatal medicine', 'peripheral blood', 'pregnancy disorder', 'skills', 'stem', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trophoblast', 'viscoelasticity', 'wasting']",NICHD,MAGEE-WOMEN'S RES INST AND FOUNDATION,R01,2016,727321,28472699,0.06628969598245422
"Fetal-Maternal Histocompatibility and Autoimmune Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to investigate the potential role of fetal-maternal histocompatibility and other HLA relationships in maternal autoimmune disease. Female predominance, onset during childbearing years, and similarities to graft-versus-host disease have led to the hypothesis that natural processes during pregnancy such as the bi-directional cellular exchange between mother and fetus could be involved in the etiology of some autoimmune conditions. The presence of cells or tissues originating from a different individual is referred to as microchimerism (MC). Studies in scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have found higher number of fetal cells, or MC, in the maternal circulation years after birth compared to healthy controls. Fetal cells could potentially elicit a graft-versus-host or a host-versus-graft effect triggering autoimmune conditions. However, the overall reduction of risk of RA and SLE associated with parity and the amelioration of RA symptoms during pregnancy, suggest that exposure to fetal DNA could also be beneficial. Overall, the exact role of MC in disease etiology remains unknown. Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules play a key role in immunologic function and are important in immune recognition of self and non-self. Histocompatibility relationships are hypothesized to play a role in effect and persistence of fetal cells. The overall hypothesis of this project is tha the nature of the fetal-maternal histocompatibility relationship determines the effect of exposure to fetal cells on risk of disease. This project will use 4-digit HLA genotypes, detailed pregnancy histories, and clinical characteristics abstracted from medical records from ~900 RA cases, SLE cases and healthy controls (300 in each group), 1,500 of their children and 400 fathers to address three related hypotheses. First, cases are more likely to share a larger number of alleles at eight classical HLA loci compared to controls. Case-control differences will be tested using logistic regression, adjusting for known confounders and genetic ancestry. Second, women who do not have increased histocompatibility with any of their offspring have a later age of onset of RA and SLE compared to women who have compatible offspring. Hazard ratios will be estimated using a Cox-proportional hazards model with age of diagnosis as the event of interest. Third, cases are more likely to be HLA similar to their partners than controls since feta loss is associated with increased histocompatibility between mother and child, in addition to increased risk of RA and SLE. We will first estimate the association between reported number of pregnancies resulting in fetal loss and risk of disease. Second, we will measure the degree of genetic similarity between mating partners by estimating a relatedness coefficient R. Fetal-maternal influences mediated through classical HLA genotypes could provide new insight into the etiology of these debilitating conditions and others where pregnancy related factors are suspected.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus are chronic, debilitating autoimmune diseases predominately affecting women of reproductive age. Microchimerism has emerged as a potentially relevant mechanism in disease etiology where fetal-maternal HLA relationships are likely to be involved. Better characterization of the effects of fetal-maternal histocompatibility will provide new information that will aid in our understandin of disease pathogenesis, provide important predictors for disease risk and help develop better therapeutic strategies.            ",Fetal-Maternal Histocompatibility and Autoimmune Disease,8987418,F31AI116064,"['Aborted Fetus', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alleles', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autoimmunity', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'DNA', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fathers', 'Female', 'Fetus', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Hormonal', 'Immunologics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Live Birth', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical Records', 'Microchimerism', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Nature', 'Odds Ratio', 'Onset of illness', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatoid Factor', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Scleroderma', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Woman', 'abstracting', 'base', 'carrier status', 'case control', 'cell mediated immune response', 'child bearing', 'cyclic citrullinated peptide', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'fetal', 'fetus cell', 'graft vs host disease', 'hazard', 'human leukocyte antigen gene', 'insight', 'interest', 'mortality', 'offspring', 'parity', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'risk variant', 'success']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2015,37873,148186688,0.042794624287795145
"Development of real-time, automated 3D ultrasound tools for the study of placental invasion and morphology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Among the most intractable pregnancy pathologies are those related to aberrant trophoblast invasion and the subsequent remodeling of maternal vasculature at the utero-placental interface (UPI). These include preeclampsia (PE), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and abnormally invasive placenta (AIP, aka placenta accreta). Despite this, tools to measure placental structure and function in the crucial late first to early second trimester period have yet to be developed that can be translated from the research environment to routine clinical use. We are now constructing 3D power Doppler ultrasound technologies that provide real-time, quantitative assessment of placental structural and vascular development. We have developed novel semi- automated methods for calculation of placental volume (PlaV) and new methods to measure gross placental morphology (GPM; dimensions, surface area etc.) and to assess the vasculature at the UPI (Fractional Moving Blood Volume, FMBV). We propose four Aims intended to move the field towards routine imaging of placental structure and function in real time and to generate clinically useful tests for monitoring significant placental pathologies. In Aim 1, using machine learning techniques and an extant database of ~2800 1st trimester placental scans, we will fully automate the novel tools developed for measurement of PlaV into a real-time analytical package. Aim 2 will focus on 3D ultrasound techniques to interrogate the vasculature at the UPI through refinement of our new method for determining FMBV, a quantitative measure of vascularity. This will lead to a tool that can assess the entire UPI, a major site of pathology in PE, IUGR and AIP. We also aim to develop 3D power Doppler ultrasound tools for the examination of the size and distribution of the spiral artery jets feeding the intervillous space, enabling us to explore normal and pathological development of the intervillous supply in real-time. Aims 3 and 4 are prospective validation studies designed to test the utility of the tools described above. Aim 3 extends our recently published study of over-invasion of the maternal vasculature to the 1 /2 trimester. The presence and severity of AIP is assessed using Acon, the largest area of standard 3D power Doppler signal at the UPI. Under-invasion will be addressed via analysis of prospectively collected 11-13 week 3D-PD scans in women who develop PE. We will compare PlaV, GPM, FMBV and spiral artery jets in normotensive and preeclamptic pregnancies. The prospective study in Aim 4 will address the environmental impact of smoking by comparing structural and vascular parameters between smokers and non-smokers at weekly intervals from 8-18 wks. These powerful longitudinal studies will map the development of morphologic and vascular features in smokers and non-smokers and provide new insights into the factors responsible for smoking-induced growth restriction. The strong investigative team, composed of bioengineers, maternal-fetal medicine specialists and placental biologists, is delivering these new tools in the research setting and is poised to generate new methods for clinical measurement of placental structure and vascular function in real-time.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If the placenta does not develop normally, complications like poor fetal growth and preeclampsia in the mother occur. We are developing new ultrasound techniques to measure the placenta early in pregnancy. This could permit early detection of problems that occur months later in the pregnancy. This would allow doctors to monitor the pregnancy and to prevent or treat problems quickly, before they have serious effects on the fetus.        ","Development of real-time, automated 3D ultrasound tools for the study of placental invasion and morphology",9076751,U01HD087209,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood Volume', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decidua', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Doppler Ultrasound', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Environmental Impact', 'Fetal Growth', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetus', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Mothers', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Accreta', 'Placentation', 'Plant Roots', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Scanning', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Specialist', 'Spiral Artery of the Endometrium', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Vascularization', 'Woman', 'feeding', 'fetal', 'fetal medicine', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'insight', 'model development', 'myometrium', 'non-smoker', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'tool', 'trophoblast', 'validation studies']",NICHD,HACKENSACK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2015,45454,20704924,0.024319939394615752
"Dietary factors and risk of uterine fibroids ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uterine leiomyoma (UL) are the most common pelvic tumor in women of reproductive age. Despite the fact that these smooth muscle tumors are benign, UL are a significant public health problem, accounting for over 200,000 hysterectomies annually, and approximately 1 in 4 women will have a UL that comes to clinical attention. Despite the high morbidity and health care costs associated with UL, the etiology is not understood, and few modifiable, protective risk factors have been identified. Dietary factors may play a role in UL etiology due to their potential to modify endogenous hormones as well as their inflammatory effects. Hypothesis/Specific Aims: Our overall hypothesis is that intake and plasma biomarker levels of dietary components that influence endogenous hormonal and inflammatory response are associated with UL risk. Few studies have examined the association between dietary factors and UL. To our knowledge, only one prospective cohort has examined the association between dairy and dietary fat intake and UL observing a reduced risk of UL with increasing dairy consumption and associations with some fatty acids. In addition, no prospective studies have examined the association with vitamin D levels. Using prospective data we will evaluate the following aims:  Aim 1. Evaluate the association between dietary fat and risk of incident uterine leiomyoma using data among 97,807 women in the NHSII cohort who completed a dietary assessment. In a subset of these women we will examine the association between circulating fatty acid levels and uterine leiomyoma.  Aim 2. Dairy food intake is associated with risk of uterine leiomyoma.  Aim 3. Vitamin D levels are associated with risk of uterine leiomyoma. Study Design: The proposed study consists of Nurses' Health Study II participants who completed a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) about their usual diet in 1991. Follow-up FFQs were completed in 1995, 1999, 2003, and 2007. Quintiles or categories of dietary intake will be generated and Cox proportional hazards models will be used to estimate hazard ratios of UL incidence associated with each of the dietary factors. Among a subset of women with pre-diagnostic biomarkers, the association between plasma vitamin D and circulating fatty acids with UL risk will be assessed with logistic regression models. The presence of prospectively collected UL, dietary, and covariate data and stored blood samples, allows cost-efficient and valid consideration of the temporality of disease diagnosis - supporting the potential identification of modifiable risk factors.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study provides us with the opportunity to examine the association between diet, a potentially modifiable risk factor, and uterine fibroids, a highly prevalent but understudied condition. We believe this study would be the first study to examine the relation between dietary fat intake and vitamin D levels and uterine fibroids. The results of this study have the potential to inform prevention strategies for a condition which accounts for $2.2 billion in health care costs annually.    	            ",Dietary factors and risk of uterine fibroids,8890403,R03HD081064,"['25-hydroxyvitamin D', 'Accounting', 'African American', 'Age', 'Applications Grants', 'Attention', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Categories', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dairy Products', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Dietary Component', 'Dietary Factors', 'Dietary Fats', 'Dietary intake', 'Eating', 'Estrogens', 'Etiology', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fibroid Tumor', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Hysterectomy', 'Immune', 'Incidence', 'Infertility', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intake', 'Interleukin-6', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measurement', 'Milk', 'Modeling', 'Mono-S', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Omega-3 Fatty Acids', 'Participant', 'Pelvic Pain', 'Pelvis', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids', 'Population Study', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Smooth Muscle Tumor', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Trans Fats', 'Trans Fatty Acids', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uterine Fibroids', 'Uterine hemorrhage', 'Vitamin D', 'Vitamins', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'calcium intake', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'disease diagnosis', 'follow-up', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'modifiable risk', 'monounsaturated fat', 'mouse model', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'saturated fat', 'screening', 'steroid hormone', 'tumor']",NICHD,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R03,2015,88625,327644200,0.03001708385068419
"Vaccine Development for Falciparum Malaria in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes more than one million deaths annually. Young children in malaria endemic areas of Africa have the highest mortality because of their immature immune systems. Global efforts to control the disease have had limited success and no vaccine has yet been approved for clinical use. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to discover new vaccine candidates using novel approaches, especially for mothers and infants who represent key target groups. Dr. Michelow's research goal for the proposed Mentored Career Development Award is to discover new anti-malarial vaccines for women of childbearing age in order to protect their highly vulnerable offspring from severe or fatal malaria in early infancy. Under the mentorship of Drs. Kurtis and Friedman from Brown University, and Drs. Duffy and Fried from the NIH/NIAID Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology, who are internationally renowned investigators, he plans to test the hypothesis that novel vaccine targets can be discovered by identifying transplacentally acquired malarial antibodies that mediate infants' resistance to severe or fatal malaria. The objective of this proposal is to identify conserved Plasmodium falciparum antigens that are uniquely recognized by IgG antibodies in venous blood obtained at delivery from mothers whose infants survived their first year of life with mild or no clinical malaria, but that are not recognized by IgG antibodies from mothers whose infants suffered severe disease or death due to malaria. Dr. Michelow's team will capitalize on plasma samples and epidemiological data that they already collected from a large well-characterized longitudinal cohort in Muheza, Tanzania (n=739). In order to achieve these objectives, they propose three Specific Aims that are directed at 1) discovering, 2) validating and 3) downselecting P. falciparum candidate vaccine antigens. The strength of this patient-oriented translational strategy derives from the fact that they will use plasma of mothers and infants with naturally acquired malarial antibodies at the earliest stage of vaccine epitope discovery. Based on the successful approach pioneered by Dr. Kurtis, they will perform a differential high throughput whole proteome screen on select groups of pooled plasma from mothers of infants with severe malaria vs. mothers of infants with mild or no malaria. They will use a newly produced P. falciparum (3D7) malaria genomic DNA T7 phage display library as well as a wild type blood-stage complementary DNA T7 phage library for this purpose. Candidate vaccine antigens will then be validated by testing a large independent cohort of mothers and infants from the same population to determine which specific malarial antibodies most reliably predict better malaria outcomes. They will employ mixed effects logistic regression modeling to account for repeated measures and confounding variables as well as the Cox proportional hazards survival model to compare time to predefined endpoints. Lead candidate antigens will then be downselected using bioinformatics and surface localization studies, as well as functional evaluations, using invasion and growth inhibition assays for blood stage candidates. Dr. Michelow's previous clinical training in Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, his research on diagnostic tests for children with pneumonia or congenital syphilis, and his laboratory work on production of novel immunotherapeutics for glycosylated virus infections, have laid a solid foundation for his proposed research project. Under the guidance of his mentors, he will bridge the gap between basic science and patient-oriented research by applying rigorous, mechanistic and creative methods of enquiry to translate basic science concepts into relevant human interventions and therapies. He plans to accomplish his goals by acquiring critical new skills in the following three key areas: 1) vaccine immunology, 2) advanced molecular methods, and 3) applied biostatistics, epidemiology and human population research. Specifically, he will be trained in methods to implement innovative phage-based molecular screening strategies, select and test optimal malaria vaccine epitopes, cultivate and genetically manipulate malaria parasites, perform cell-based infection assays, interrogate the malaria genome/proteome databases, use sophisticated cell imaging technologies, model complex data using advanced statistical methods to account for confounding variables and repeated measures, and reinforce importance of bioethical issues. The proposed research experiences will prepare Dr. Michelow to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming a skilled investigator in hypothesis-driven translational research in the field of malaria vaccine discovery. One or more rationally identified lead candidate vaccine epitopes from the current proposal will form the basis of his R01 application. His objectives will be to 1) confirm the relevance of the antigen/s derived from native P. falciparum strains from Tanzania, 2) conduct animal studies to study effectiveness and mechanisms of action of new vaccines, and 3) establish a Phase I healthy human volunteer vaccine study. Dr. Michelow and his team of highly accomplished investigators are committed to the mission of developing new effective malaria vaccines using creative strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes the highest mortality in African children. This research aims to develop an effective new malaria vaccine to protect infants by taking advantage of maternal antibodies that cross the placenta.

"Individual Patient Data Meta-analysis of Treating BV to Prevent Prematurity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth is the leading cause of infant mortality, and bacterial vaginosis (BV), a common condition, has been consistently associated with a doubled risk of preterm birth. However randomized trials of treating BV to prevent preterm birth have produced mixed results. Systematic reviews using aggregate study data found no overall benefit of treatment, but raised possibilities of benefit to women at high preterm birth risk treatd at <20 weeks' gestation. To overcome the limitations of conventional meta- analysis, we propose pooling the raw data from the trials in an individual patient data meta-analysis. Using pooled raw data, we will have greater power to evaluate the benefit of treatment of BV in subgroups of individuals and measure the days of pregnancy prolongation in treated and untreated women. Use of aggregate data does not facilitate analyses based on individual patient characteristics, such as gestational age at randomization, as is possible with individual data. In particular, we will investigate the interaction between gestational age at treatment and a priori risk of preterm birth on prolongation of pregnancy. We have commitments from 10 study PIs, representing 72% of women randomized in all the trials, to provide data and help understand variables and analyses reported from their studies. Preparing the data for analysis and harmonizing variables across studies is a major effort. Our team has extensive experience and expertise in maternal fetal medicine in general and preterm birth and BV in particular as well as database management and statistics. Missing data methods, including multiple imputation, will be employed for some variables. Logistic regression models with random effects for specific studies and interactions between treatment (drug/placebo), gestational age at randomization, and a priori risk will be fit to identify subgroups of pregnant women in whom the risk of preterm birth is reduced. Time to event (i.e., birth) models with random effects and interactions will be used to estimate the number of days of pregnancy prolongation attributable to treatment of BV in pregnant women. A sensitivity analysis will be conducted to study the influence of single studies, inclusion of aggregate as well as individual data, and statistical models. Developments in this area have utilized Bayesian hierarchical models, which have the flexibility to incorporate data of different types. Computations will employ Monte Carlo Markov chain simulation in R and WinBugs. Statistical methods will be extended as appropriate. This project is novel in at least three ways: a unique collection of data sets and major effort to combine them, unique analyses of the impact of BV treatment on preterm birth, and unique sensitivity analyses and statistical methods. We expect to identify subgroups of women who benefit from treatment and the optimal window to initiate treatment and to have a significant positive impact on maternal and child health through screening and treatment recommendations.

"Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of cervical remodeling during pregnancy and labor is incomplete, partly due to the lack of in vivo studies on the biochemical changes that occur in the cervix over the course of pregnancy. Elucidation of the mechanisms for cervical ripening could be used to predict the onset of preterm labor. Until recently, in vivo research methods were too invasive to be used as discovery tools, particularly in women who present with preterm labor. This proposal will use in vivo Raman spectroscopy, an optical technique that is sensitive to collagen content, collagen structure, hydration, lipids, proteins, ad other biomolecules to non-invasively investigate the biochemistry of the cervix throughout pregnancy. Using fiber optic in vivo Raman spectroscopy, we recently found significant differences in Raman spectra in at least four important peaks during the course of pregnancy in mice, including discrete signatures for lipids, collagen, amide bonds, and enriched amino acids (proline, tyrosine). Computational analysis of these spectra yielded predictive algorithms with 94% classification accuracy for stage of pregnancy. Studies performed in 2-hour windows at the end of pregnancy identified spectra predictive for the timing of parturition. This approach provides a detailed real-time biomolecular map of cervical ripening that is currently unavailable by other means. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the different mechanisms of premature cervical ripening have unique Raman spectral signatures that correspond to underlying biochemical and mechanical changes that precede preterm birth, which can be detected in vivo. Two Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Determine spectral changes in the cervix of mice with normal and abnormal pregnancy and parturition; 2) Identify specific mediators of cervical remodeling by comparing Raman spectra to mechanical and biochemical changes in the ex vivo cervix during normal and abnormal parturition. Raman spectroscopy has primarily been used for detection of disease. Collaboration between our reproductive biology and bioengineering groups will capitalize on our expertise in Raman analysis of cervical tissues to study dynamic changes in cervix composition during pregnancy. Key elements in cervical biochemistry will be identified. In vivo Raman spectroscopy will be combined with biomechanical studies and imaging mass spectrometry, a powerful tool for in situ proteomic analysis, to examine mice with premature or delayed cervical remodeling. Together, these highly innovative approaches will generate in-depth profiles of cervical biology that will translate into novel non-invasive methods to detect impending premature birth in women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will use Raman Spectroscopy, a non-invasive, optical scattering technique, to investigate the composition of the cervix throughout pregnancy and provide detailed real-time information on cervical ripening. These studies will identify spectral differences in the cervix during normal and abnormal cervical maturation; optical and biochemical markers will be identified to help monitor pregnancy non-invasively, as the fiber optic probe only requires brief contact with the external surface of the cervix to obtain measurements. Elucidating the mechanisms that initiate cervical ripening will provide a critical step for early detection and treatment of preterm birth, which is the leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality.",Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy,8925122,R01HD081121,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alprostadil', 'Amides', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Birth', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Ripening', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elasticity', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Etiology', 'Fetal Development', 'Fiber Optics', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Hormonal', 'Hour', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Indium', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mifepristone', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Optics', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Labor', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proline', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RU-486', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Reproductive Biology', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Tyrosine', 'Woman', 'base', 'clinical application', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity/mortality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'physical science', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnant', 'premature', 'response', 'tool']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,362979,117374875,0.05834435532949888
"Effectiveness of Treating Prenatal Depression to Reduce Postpartum Depression DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Postpartum depression (PPD) afflicts about 10-15% of pregnant women. Depression during pregnancy is the strongest risk factor for PPD. However, currently, significant confusion exists about whether treating depression during pregnancy could reduce the risk of PPD. Our preliminary studies suggest that treating prenatal depression may reduce PPD risk. To further determine (1) if prenatal depression itself increases the risk of PPD, thus should be treated, (2) if treatment is beneficial, and (3) which treatment is most effective i reducing PPD, we propose to conduct a two-stage prospective cohort study in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). KPNC has implemented a unique universal peripartum depression screening program. All pregnant women (about 33,000 annually) are screened for depression twice during pregnancy and once postpartum using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). During the study period, 120,000 pregnant women who are screened for depression will be included in a peripartum depression screening registry. Using the information on depression status and treatment choices from all 120,000 women (stage-one sample), five cohorts will be formed: (A) ""Untreated cohort"": those who screen positive for depression during pregnancy, but do not receive treatment; (B) "" Psychotherapy cohort"": screen positive and receive psychotherapy only; (C) ""Antidepressant cohort"": screen positive and use antidepressants only; (D) ""Combination treatments cohort"": screen positive and use both psychotherapy and antidepressants; and (E) ""Control cohort"": screen negative for depression and do not receive any treatments. For the stage-two sub-sample, we will randomly select 400 subjects from each of the five cohorts (a total of 2,000 women) and interview them in-person to obtain detailed information on confounders and effect modifiers for adjustment. Comparison of Cohort A versus Cohort E will determine if untreated depression in pregnancy increases the risk of PPD. Comparisons of Cohorts B, C, and D to Cohort A, respectively, will determine the effectiveness of depression treatment. Pair-wise comparisons among Cohorts B, C, and D will determine the comparative effectiveness of various treatment options including psychotherapy, anti-depressants, and combination therapies. Multiple linear regression analyses will be used to examine the treatment effectiveness in improving depression status from during to after pregnancy where within person change in PHQ-9 scores between prenatal and postpartum periods are compared. Logistic regression analyses will be used to examine the treatment effectiveness in reducing PPD risk where PPD risk (a dichotomized variable) is compared among all treatment groups. The findings will provide answers to pressing clinical questions of whether depression in pregnancy should be treated and, if so, which option is the best for reducing PPD. Selecting an effective treatment could lead to a reduction in PPD which remains a leading public health challenge worldwide. The established registry could be a valuable resource for many future studies of long-term effects of depression on maternal health and children's development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will determine whether treating depression during pregnancy would reduce the risk or severity of postparturm depression, and, if so, which treatment option (psychotherapy or antidepressants) is more effective in reducing postpartum depression.",Effectiveness of Treating Prenatal Depression to Reduce Postpartum Depression,8901862,R01HS021515,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2015,499998,111231681,0.060809448341058496
"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the placenta is critical for fetal development and pregnancy outcome, it is not currently accessible for real-time diagnostics throughout pregnancy. Having developed tools for isolation and analysis of placenta- specific extracellular from the maternal plasma, we will study molecular and biophysical properties of these vesicles as indicators of placental health and disease.            ",Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury,9019135,R01HD086325,"['Abruptio Placentae', 'Acoustics', 'Apoptotic', 'Arteries', 'Bathing', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endoglin', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetal Tissues', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Glean', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Nutrient', 'PGF gene', 'Pathology', 'Perinatal', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A', 'Premature Birth', 'Production', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Research Institute', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Venipunctures', 'Vesicle', 'Viscosity', 'Woman', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'biophysical techniques', 'circular RNA', 'clinical care', 'cost effective', 'design', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'fetal', 'fitness', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'innovation', 'micro-total analysis system', 'nanofabrication', 'nanomechanics', 'nanovesicle', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'pregnancy disorder', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'stem', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trophoblast', 'viscoelasticity', 'wasting']",NICHD,MAGEE-WOMEN'S RES INST AND FOUNDATION,R01,2015,804679,28472699,0.06628969598245422

"Vaccine Development for Falciparum Malaria in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes more than one million deaths annually. Young children in malaria endemic areas of Africa have the highest mortality because of their immature immune systems. Global efforts to control the disease have had limited success and no vaccine has yet been approved for clinical use. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to discover new vaccine candidates using novel approaches, especially for mothers and infants who represent key target groups. Dr. Michelow's research goal for the proposed Mentored Career Development Award is to discover new anti-malarial vaccines for women of childbearing age in order to protect their highly vulnerable offspring from severe or fatal malaria in early infancy. Under the mentorship of Drs. Kurtis and Friedman from Brown University, and Drs. Duffy and Fried from the NIH/NIAID Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology, who are internationally renowned investigators, he plans to test the hypothesis that novel vaccine targets can be discovered by identifying transplacentally acquired malarial antibodies that mediate infants' resistance to severe or fatal malaria. The objective of this proposal is to identify conserved Plasmodium falciparum antigens that are uniquely recognized by IgG antibodies in venous blood obtained at delivery from mothers whose infants survived their first year of life with mild or no clinical malaria, but that are not recognized by IgG antibodies from mothers whose infants suffered severe disease or death due to malaria. Dr. Michelow's team will capitalize on plasma samples and epidemiological data that they already collected from a large well-characterized longitudinal cohort in Muheza, Tanzania (n=739). In order to achieve these objectives, they propose three Specific Aims that are directed at 1) discovering, 2) validating and 3) downselecting P. falciparum candidate vaccine antigens. The strength of this patient-oriented translational strategy derives from the fact that they will use plasma of mothers and infants with naturally acquired malarial antibodies at the earliest stage of vaccine epitope discovery. Based on the successful approach pioneered by Dr. Kurtis, they will perform a differential high throughput whole proteome screen on select groups of pooled plasma from mothers of infants with severe malaria vs. mothers of infants with mild or no malaria. They will use a newly produced P. falciparum (3D7) malaria genomic DNA T7 phage display library as well as a wild type blood-stage complementary DNA T7 phage library for this purpose. Candidate vaccine antigens will then be validated by testing a large independent cohort of mothers and infants from the same population to determine which specific malarial antibodies most reliably predict better malaria outcomes. They will employ mixed effects logistic regression modeling to account for repeated measures and confounding variables as well as the Cox proportional hazards survival model to compare time to predefined endpoints. Lead candidate antigens will then be downselected using bioinformatics and surface localization studies, as well as functional evaluations, using invasion and growth inhibition assays for blood stage candidates. Dr. Michelow's previous clinical training in Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, his research on diagnostic tests for children with pneumonia or congenital syphilis, and his laboratory work on production of novel immunotherapeutics for glycosylated virus infections, have laid a solid foundation for his proposed research project. Under the guidance of his mentors, he will bridge the gap between basic science and patient-oriented research by applying rigorous, mechanistic and creative methods of enquiry to translate basic science concepts into relevant human interventions and therapies. He plans to accomplish his goals by acquiring critical new skills in the following three key areas: 1) vaccine immunology, 2) advanced molecular methods, and 3) applied biostatistics, epidemiology and human population research. Specifically, he will be trained in methods to implement innovative phage-based molecular screening strategies, select and test optimal malaria vaccine epitopes, cultivate and genetically manipulate malaria parasites, perform cell-based infection assays, interrogate the malaria genome/proteome databases, use sophisticated cell imaging technologies, model complex data using advanced statistical methods to account for confounding variables and repeated measures, and reinforce importance of bioethical issues. The proposed research experiences will prepare Dr. Michelow to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming a skilled investigator in hypothesis-driven translational research in the field of malaria vaccine discovery. One or more rationally identified lead candidate vaccine epitopes from the current proposal will form the basis of his R01 application. His objectives will be to 1) confirm the relevance of the antigen/s derived from native P. falciparum strains from Tanzania, 2) conduct animal studies to study effectiveness and mechanisms of action of new vaccines, and 3) establish a Phase I healthy human volunteer vaccine study. Dr. Michelow and his team of highly accomplished investigators are committed to the mission of developing new effective malaria vaccines using creative strategies.         PROJECT NARRATIVE: Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes the highest mortality in African children. This research aims to develop an effective new malaria vaccine to protect infants by taking advantage of maternal antibodies that cross the placenta.

"Individual Patient Data Meta-analysis of Treating BV to Prevent Prematurity     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth is the leading cause of infant mortality, and bacterial vaginosis (BV), a common condition, has been consistently associated with a doubled risk of preterm birth. However randomized trials of treating BV to prevent preterm birth have produced mixed results. Systematic reviews using aggregate study data found no overall benefit of treatment, but raised possibilities of benefit to women at high preterm birth risk treatd at <20 weeks' gestation. To overcome the limitations of conventional meta- analysis, we propose pooling the raw data from the trials in an individual patient data meta-analysis. Using pooled raw data, we will have greater power to evaluate the benefit of treatment of BV in subgroups of individuals and measure the days of pregnancy prolongation in treated and untreated women. Use of aggregate data does not facilitate analyses based on individual patient characteristics, such as gestational age at randomization, as is possible with individual data. In particular, we will investigate the interaction between gestational age at treatment and a priori risk of preterm birth on prolongation of pregnancy. We have commitments from 10 study PIs, representing 72% of women randomized in all the trials, to provide data and help understand variables and analyses reported from their studies. Preparing the data for analysis and harmonizing variables across studies is a major effort. Our team has extensive experience and expertise in maternal fetal medicine in general and preterm birth and BV in particular as well as database management and statistics. Missing data methods, including multiple imputation, will be employed for some variables. Logistic regression models with random effects for specific studies and interactions between treatment (drug/placebo), gestational age at randomization, and a priori risk will be fit to identify subgroups of pregnant women in whom the risk of preterm birth is reduced. Time to event (i.e., birth) models with random effects and interactions will be used to estimate the number of days of pregnancy prolongation attributable to treatment of BV in pregnant women. A sensitivity analysis will be conducted to study the influence of single studies, inclusion of aggregate as well as individual data, and statistical models. Developments in this area have utilized Bayesian hierarchical models, which have the flexibility to incorporate data of different types. Computations will employ Monte Carlo Markov chain simulation in R and WinBugs. Statistical methods will be extended as appropriate. This project is novel in at least three ways: a unique collection of data sets and major effort to combine them, unique analyses of the impact of BV treatment on preterm birth, and unique sensitivity analyses and statistical methods. We expect to identify subgroups of women who benefit from treatment and the optimal window to initiate treatment and to have a significant positive impact on maternal and child health through screening and treatment recommendations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bacterial vaginosis (BV), a common condition, has been consistently associated with a doubled risk of preterm birth, a leading cause of infant mortality. Randomized trials and reviews using aggregate data have produced mixed results. A meta-analysis of individual patient data from multiple studies is a cost effective, necessary step in assessing the benefit of BV treatment and defining best clinical practice.            ",Individual Patient Data Meta-analysis of Treating BV to Prevent Prematurity,8768892,R21HD078877,"['Advisory Committees', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Area', 'Bacterial Vaginosis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Birth', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Base Management', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Early treatment', 'Event', 'Genital system', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Mortality', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lactobacillus', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Markov Chains', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome Study', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Placebos', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Preventive', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vagina', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cost effective', 'expectation', 'experience', 'fetal medicine', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'infant morbidity/mortality', 'mortality', 'novel', 'premature', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'screening', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'systematic review', 'treatment effect']",NICHD,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,198234,86807134,0.059947625301867175
"Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of cervical remodeling during pregnancy and labor is incomplete, partly due to the lack of in vivo studies on the biochemical changes that occur in the cervix over the course of pregnancy. Elucidation of the mechanisms for cervical ripening could be used to predict the onset of preterm labor. Until recently, in vivo research methods were too invasive to be used as discovery tools, particularly in women who present with preterm labor. This proposal will use in vivo Raman spectroscopy, an optical technique that is sensitive to collagen content, collagen structure, hydration, lipids, proteins, ad other biomolecules to non-invasively investigate the biochemistry of the cervix throughout pregnancy. Using fiber optic in vivo Raman spectroscopy, we recently found significant differences in Raman spectra in at least four important peaks during the course of pregnancy in mice, including discrete signatures for lipids, collagen, amide bonds, and enriched amino acids (proline, tyrosine). Computational analysis of these spectra yielded predictive algorithms with 94% classification accuracy for stage of pregnancy. Studies performed in 2-hour windows at the end of pregnancy identified spectra predictive for the timing of parturition. This approach provides a detailed real-time biomolecular map of cervical ripening that is currently unavailable by other means. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the different mechanisms of premature cervical ripening have unique Raman spectral signatures that correspond to underlying biochemical and mechanical changes that precede preterm birth, which can be detected in vivo. Two Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Determine spectral changes in the cervix of mice with normal and abnormal pregnancy and parturition; 2) Identify specific mediators of cervical remodeling by comparing Raman spectra to mechanical and biochemical changes in the ex vivo cervix during normal and abnormal parturition. Raman spectroscopy has primarily been used for detection of disease. Collaboration between our reproductive biology and bioengineering groups will capitalize on our expertise in Raman analysis of cervical tissues to study dynamic changes in cervix composition during pregnancy. Key elements in cervical biochemistry will be identified. In vivo Raman spectroscopy will be combined with biomechanical studies and imaging mass spectrometry, a powerful tool for in situ proteomic analysis, to examine mice with premature or delayed cervical remodeling. Together, these highly innovative approaches will generate in-depth profiles of cervical biology that will translate into novel non-invasive methods to detect impending premature birth in women.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will use Raman Spectroscopy, a non-invasive, optical scattering technique, to investigate the composition of the cervix throughout pregnancy and provide detailed real-time information on cervical ripening. These studies will identify spectral differences in the cervix during normal and abnormal cervical maturation; optical and biochemical markers will be identified to help monitor pregnancy non-invasively, as the fiber optic probe only requires brief contact with the external surface of the cervix to obtain measurements. Elucidating the mechanisms that initiate cervical ripening will provide a critical step for early detection and treatment of preterm birth, which is the leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality.            ",Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy,8766404,R01HD081121,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alprostadil', 'Amides', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Birth', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Ripening', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elasticity', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Etiology', 'Fetal Development', 'Fiber Optics', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Hormonal', 'Hour', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Indium', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mifepristone', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Optics', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Labor', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proline', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RU-486', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Reproductive Biology', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Tyrosine', 'Woman', 'base', 'clinical application', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity/mortality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'physical science', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnant', 'premature', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,387356,117374875,0.05834435532949888
"Effectiveness of Treating Prenatal Depression to Reduce Postpartum Depression     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Postpartum depression (PPD) afflicts about 10-15% of pregnant women. Depression during pregnancy is the strongest risk factor for PPD. However, currently, significant confusion exists about whether treating depression during pregnancy could reduce the risk of PPD. Our preliminary studies suggest that treating prenatal depression may reduce PPD risk. To further determine (1) if prenatal depression itself increases the risk of PPD, thus should be treated, (2) if treatment is beneficial, and (3) which treatment is most effective i reducing PPD, we propose to conduct a two-stage prospective cohort study in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). KPNC has implemented a unique universal peripartum depression screening program. All pregnant women (about 33,000 annually) are screened for depression twice during pregnancy and once postpartum using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). During the study period, 120,000 pregnant women who are screened for depression will be included in a peripartum depression screening registry. Using the information on depression status and treatment choices from all 120,000 women (stage-one sample), five cohorts will be formed: (A) ""Untreated cohort"": those who screen positive for depression during pregnancy, but do not receive treatment; (B) "" Psychotherapy cohort"": screen positive and receive psychotherapy only; (C) ""Antidepressant cohort"": screen positive and use antidepressants only; (D) ""Combination treatments cohort"": screen positive and use both psychotherapy and antidepressants; and (E) ""Control cohort"": screen negative for depression and do not receive any treatments. For the stage-two sub-sample, we will randomly select 400 subjects from each of the five cohorts (a total of 2,000 women) and interview them in-person to obtain detailed information on confounders and effect modifiers for adjustment. Comparison of Cohort A versus Cohort E will determine if untreated depression in pregnancy increases the risk of PPD. Comparisons of Cohorts B, C, and D to Cohort A, respectively, will determine the effectiveness of depression treatment. Pair-wise comparisons among Cohorts B, C, and D will determine the comparative effectiveness of various treatment options including psychotherapy, anti-depressants, and combination therapies. Multiple linear regression analyses will be used to examine the treatment effectiveness in improving depression status from during to after pregnancy where within person change in PHQ-9 scores between prenatal and postpartum periods are compared. Logistic regression analyses will be used to examine the treatment effectiveness in reducing PPD risk where PPD risk (a dichotomized variable) is compared among all treatment groups. The findings will provide answers to pressing clinical questions of whether depression in pregnancy should be treated and, if so, which option is the best for reducing PPD. Selecting an effective treatment could lead to a reduction in PPD which remains a leading public health challenge worldwide. The established registry could be a valuable resource for many future studies of long-term effects of depression on maternal health and children's development.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will determine whether treating depression during pregnancy would reduce the risk or severity of postparturm depression, and, if so, which treatment option (psychotherapy or antidepressants) is more effective in reducing postpartum depression.

"Vaccine Development for Falciparum Malaria in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes more than one million deaths annually. Young children in malaria endemic areas of Africa have the highest mortality because of their immature immune systems. Global efforts to control the disease have had limited success and no vaccine has yet been approved for clinical use. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to discover new vaccine candidates using novel approaches, especially for mothers and infants who represent key target groups. Dr. Michelow's research goal for the proposed Mentored Career Development Award is to discover new anti-malarial vaccines for women of childbearing age in order to protect their highly vulnerable offspring from severe or fatal malaria in early infancy. Under the mentorship of Drs. Kurtis and Friedman from Brown University, and Drs. Duffy and Fried from the NIH/NIAID Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology, who are internationally renowned investigators, he plans to test the hypothesis that novel vaccine targets can be discovered by identifying transplacentally acquired malarial antibodies that mediate infants' resistance to severe or fatal malaria. The objective of this proposal is to identify conserved Plasmodium falciparum antigens that are uniquely recognized by IgG antibodies in venous blood obtained at delivery from mothers whose infants survived their first year of life with mild or no clinical malaria, but that are not recognized by IgG antibodies from mothers whose infants suffered severe disease or death due to malaria. Dr. Michelow's team will capitalize on plasma samples and epidemiological data that they already collected from a large well-characterized longitudinal cohort in Muheza, Tanzania (n=739). In order to achieve these objectives, they propose three Specific Aims that are directed at 1) discovering, 2) validating and 3) downselecting P. falciparum candidate vaccine antigens. The strength of this patient-oriented translational strategy derives from the fact that they will use plasma of mothers and infants with naturally acquired malarial antibodies at the earliest stage of vaccine epitope discovery. Based on the successful approach pioneered by Dr. Kurtis, they will perform a differential high throughput whole proteome screen on select groups of pooled plasma from mothers of infants with severe malaria vs. mothers of infants with mild or no malaria. They will use a newly produced P. falciparum (3D7) malaria genomic DNA T7 phage display library as well as a wild type blood-stage complementary DNA T7 phage library for this purpose. Candidate vaccine antigens will then be validated by testing a large independent cohort of mothers and infants from the same population to determine which specific malarial antibodies most reliably predict better malaria outcomes. They will employ mixed effects logistic regression modeling to account for repeated measures and confounding variables as well as the Cox proportional hazards survival model to compare time to predefined endpoints. Lead candidate antigens will then be downselected using bioinformatics and surface localization studies, as well as functional evaluations, using invasion and growth inhibition assays for blood stage candidates. Dr. Michelow's previous clinical training in Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, his research on diagnostic tests for children with pneumonia or congenital syphilis, and his laboratory work on production of novel immunotherapeutics for glycosylated virus infections, have laid a solid foundation for his proposed research project. Under the guidance of his mentors, he will bridge the gap between basic science and patient-oriented research by applying rigorous, mechanistic and creative methods of enquiry to translate basic science concepts into relevant human interventions and therapies. He plans to accomplish his goals by acquiring critical new skills in the following three key areas: 1) vaccine immunology, 2) advanced molecular methods, and 3) applied biostatistics, epidemiology and human population research. Specifically, he will be trained in methods to implement innovative phage-based molecular screening strategies, select and test optimal malaria vaccine epitopes, cultivate and genetically manipulate malaria parasites, perform cell-based infection assays, interrogate the malaria genome/proteome databases, use sophisticated cell imaging technologies, model complex data using advanced statistical methods to account for confounding variables and repeated measures, and reinforce importance of bioethical issues. The proposed research experiences will prepare Dr. Michelow to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming a skilled investigator in hypothesis-driven translational research in the field of malaria vaccine discovery. One or more rationally identified lead candidate vaccine epitopes from the current proposal will form the basis of his R01 application. His objectives will be to 1) confirm the relevance of the antigen/s derived from native P. falciparum strains from Tanzania, 2) conduct animal studies to study effectiveness and mechanisms of action of new vaccines, and 3) establish a Phase I healthy human volunteer vaccine study. Dr. Michelow and his team of highly accomplished investigators are committed to the mission of developing new effective malaria vaccines using creative strategies.          PROJECT NARRATIVE: Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes the highest mortality in African children. This research aims to develop an effective new malaria vaccine to protect infants by taking advantage of maternal antibodies that cross the placenta. Candidate vaccine proteins will be screened, confirmed and selected for clinical trials using pioneering molecular tools and blood samples from pregnant African women and their infants.                ",Vaccine Development for Falciparum Malaria in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring,8508595,K08AI100997,"['Accounting', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'African', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Bacteriophage T7', 'Bacteriophages', 'Basic Science', 'Bioethical Issues', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Blood typing procedure', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Commit', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Complementary DNA', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Congenital Syphilis', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Female of child bearing age', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Volunteers', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'In Vitro', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Maternal antibody', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parasitemia', 'Parasites', 'Phage Display', 'Phase', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Pregnant Women', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Solid', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Tanzania', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Tropical Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccines', 'Venous', 'Virus Diseases', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'cellular imaging', 'cohort', 'disorder control', 'epidemiologic data', 'experience', 'hazard', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant death', 'infant outcome', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel vaccines', 'offspring', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'pregnant', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'translational approach', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine-induced immunity', 'vaccinology']",NIAID,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,K08,2013,155064,37921345,0.05140190554933966

Several projects start in year 1 and reflect an extension of the joint activities as part of the existing cooperative agreement (CoAg) between LSTM and CDC's Malaria Branch. These include a study to develop tools to monitor antimalarial drug safety in early pregnancy and a survey to evaluate a new rapid assessment toolkit for the evaluation of access, delivery and use of interventions for malaria in pregnancy, both in western Kenya; the central coordination of a multi-country observational study in Africa to determine the effect of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance on intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) effectiveness, and two studies in Indonesia: a) a study evaluating the use of cell-phone technology to improve malaria surveillance by village based health-care workers in remote settings in Indonesia; b) evaluation of the performance of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for the control of malaria in pregnancy in remote settings. In addition, grant proposals will be written in years 1 and 2 to generate research funds for the activities planned in years 2-5, including studies of integrated approaches to disease control which combine screening for HIV with scheduled screening for malaria, syphilis and anemia, and use of intermittent screening and treatment of malaria in pregnancy. During the course of the CoAg, LSTM will provide technical support to CDC as requested for specific pharmacokinetic studies in HIV- infected adults, in children (age-based dosing) and in pregnant women (Mefloquine). Lastly, the activities include formal PhD training of individuals and short-term training in clinical trial methodology.

"Effectiveness of Treating Prenatal Depression to Reduce Postpartum Depression     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Postpartum depression (PPD) afflicts about 10-15% of pregnant women. Depression during pregnancy is the strongest risk factor for PPD. However, currently, significant confusion exists about whether treating depression during pregnancy could reduce the risk of PPD. Our preliminary studies suggest that treating prenatal depression may reduce PPD risk. To further determine (1) if prenatal depression itself increases the risk of PPD, thus should be treated, (2) if treatment is beneficial, and (3) which treatment is most effective i reducing PPD, we propose to conduct a two-stage prospective cohort study in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). KPNC has implemented a unique universal peripartum depression screening program. All pregnant women (about 33,000 annually) are screened for depression twice during pregnancy and once postpartum using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). During the study period, 120,000 pregnant women who are screened for depression will be included in a peripartum depression screening registry. Using the information on depression status and treatment choices from all 120,000 women (stage-one sample), five cohorts will be formed: (A) ""Untreated cohort"": those who screen positive for depression during pregnancy, but do not receive treatment; (B) "" Psychotherapy cohort"": screen positive and receive psychotherapy only; (C) ""Antidepressant cohort"": screen positive and use antidepressants only; (D) ""Combination treatments cohort"": screen positive and use both psychotherapy and antidepressants; and (E) ""Control cohort"": screen negative for depression and do not receive any treatments. For the stage-two sub-sample, we will randomly select 400 subjects from each of the five cohorts (a total of 2,000 women) and interview them in-person to obtain detailed information on confounders and effect modifiers for adjustment. Comparison of Cohort A versus Cohort E will determine if untreated depression in pregnancy increases the risk of PPD. Comparisons of Cohorts B, C, and D to Cohort A, respectively, will determine the effectiveness of depression treatment. Pair-wise comparisons among Cohorts B, C, and D will determine the comparative effectiveness of various treatment options including psychotherapy, anti-depressants, and combination therapies. Multiple linear regression analyses will be used to examine the treatment effectiveness in improving depression status from during to after pregnancy where within person change in PHQ-9 scores between prenatal and postpartum periods are compared. Logistic regression analyses will be used to examine the treatment effectiveness in reducing PPD risk where PPD risk (a dichotomized variable) is compared among all treatment groups. The findings will provide answers to pressing clinical questions of whether depression in pregnancy should be treated and, if so, which option is the best for reducing PPD. Selecting an effective treatment could lead to a reduction in PPD which remains a leading public health challenge worldwide. The established registry could be a valuable resource for many future studies of long-term effects of depression on maternal health and children's development.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will determine whether treating depression during pregnancy would reduce the risk or severity of postparturm depression, and, if so, which treatment option (psychotherapy or antidepressants) is more effective in reducing postpartum depression.              The proposed study will determine whether treating depression during pregnancy would reduce the risk or severity of postparturm depression, and, if so, which treatment option (psychotherapy or antidepressants) is more effective in reducing postpartum depression.            ",Effectiveness of Treating Prenatal Depression to Reduce Postpartum Depression,8350415,R01HS021515,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2012,487267,111231681,0.05765104040658995
"Longitudinal effects of custody loss on drug use and crime of African American wo    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the present study is to understand how custody loss is related to substance use and criminal behavior among African American women who are mothers across criminal offender status. While drug use is similar across racial groups in the US, African Americans disproportionately experience child welfare and criminal justice system involvement as a result of drug misuse. Very limited scientific data is available to help understand the effect of custody loss on a woman's subsequent substance use and crime. Prominent on NIDA's research agenda is the promotion of research addressing health disparities and vulnerabilities among minority populations. The proposed project addresses a facet of this mission by examining custody loss as a predictor of increased substance use and criminal behavior among African American women. Specifically, the main objectives of this project are to identify risk factors for custody loss in this population and to assess the substance use and criminal behavior-related outcomes of custody loss. Because children are a significant source of social support for mothers, the loss of such support is likely to increase dependence upon other sources of support such as family and friends. When this support is adequate, women may be less likely to increase their substance use and criminal behavior after losing custody. This study is significant because of its potential to identify differences in the substance use and criminal behavior outcomes of custody loss among African American women and uncover disparities among drug using and non-drug using women across three levels of criminal justice involvement (n=200 per group): prison, probation, and community (no criminal justice involvement). Data for analyses will be derived from Waves 1-3 of the ""African American Female Drug Users: HIV, Health Disparities, and Criminality"" study (also known as ""B-WISE""; NIDA R01-DA22967), an ongoing longitudinal study of 600 African American women. All women are interviewed at baseline and at 6 and 12 months after the initial interview. The specific aims of the present study are (1) To describe the characteristics of African American women who have lost custody of their children, compared to women who have not; (2) To examine the mediating effect of custody loss on the relationship between individual level factors (criminal justice and drug user status) and changes in substance use and criminal behavior over the 12-month study time frame; and (3) To determine if characteristics of the child, the custody loss event, and perceptions of social support are significant predictors of a change in substance use and criminal behavior after losing custody. Multinomial logistic regression will be used to estimate the impact of factors such as social support, criminal justice status, characteristic of the child, and characteristics of the custody loss event on post-custody loss changes in drug use and crime. The significance of this study includes the potential to provide data for criminal justice system and child welfare system policy for the prevention, intervention, and treatment of African American mothers who are substance users.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is significant to the public health field because of its potential to uncover disparities among African American women across criminal justice status and drug use status, prior to and after losing custody. This knowledge can be used as a foundation for future criminal justice and child welfare systems-level interventions targeted at early detection and treatment of substance abuse that utilize women's sources of social support as allies. Such interventions would reduce the need for costly child placement services and incarceration, ultimately reducing the disparities experienced by African American women.              This study is significant to the public health field because of its potential to uncover disparities among African American women across criminal justice status and drug use status, prior to and after losing custody.

"Non-Hodgkin lymphoma in women: reproductive, hormonal and genetic factors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract Non-Hodgkin lymphoma in women: reproductive, hormonal and genetic factors Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the most common hematopoietic cancer in U.S. adults and has a higher incidence in men than in women (ratio of 1.4:1). Although several studies have investigated the association between reproductive factors and exogenous sex-hormone exposures to explain this sex differential, results have been varied and no comprehensive assessment of relevant epidemiologic and genetic factors related to risk of NHL and NHL subtypes has been conducted. Our innovative analyses will leverage NCI funding by using epidemiologic and genetic data already collected in our large population-based case-control NHL study (2055 cases, 2081 controls) to: Aim 1) determine whether endogenous and exogenous hormone exposures in women are associated with risk of NHL and common NHL subtypes and; Aim 2) determine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to steroidogenesis or that function in the same immune- related biologic pathways as sex-hormones, alter the association between factors in Aim 1 and risk of NHL and NHL subtypes. SNPs in sex-hormone genes of interest include estrogen receptors (ESR), cytochrome P450 17A1 (CYP17A1), sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), and in immune/inflammatory pathways include interleukins (IL), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-:B), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-1) and lymphotoxin alpha (LTA). Risk of NHL also has been associated with increased body mass index (BMI) and some autoimmune conditions with each in turn associated with levels and circulation of sex- hormones. Therefore, BMI and autoimmune conditions will be carefully assessed as potential confounders and effect modifiers of the association between hormonal effects and NHL risk. Parsimonious multivariable unconditional logistic regression models will be used to obtain odds ratios as estimates of relative risk. Gene- environment interactions will be evaluated for exposures and SNPs in genes that function in the same biologic pathways, e.g. pregnancy-related factors, and SNPs in IL-10, TNF-1, ESR1 and ESR2. False discovery rate methods will be used to control for multiple hypothesis testing. The study's major strengths are: 1) DNA already analyzed for SNPs in 146 genes in biologic pathways that may be relevant to the association between sex-hormone s and NHL susceptibility; 2) already collected rich epidemiologic dataset including extensive reproductive history, sex-steroid hormone use, autoimmune conditions and BMI available to evaluate main effects, confounding and effect modification; 5) pathological confirmation and NHL subtype classification using the WHO classification; 6) data will be pooled for future analyses within the InterLymph Consortium allowing analyses of rare subtypes and exposure. Clarifying the role of these sex-hormone related factors in NHL risk will improve our understanding of lymphomagenesis, generate hypotheses for future research and be directly applicable to screening and prevention programs to reduce NHL incidence.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative Incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is higher in men than in women and few risk factors have been established other than those associated with severe immunosuppression and some rare genetic conditions. Given that sex-hormones impact immune function, it is plausible that hormonal-related exposures and conditions that differ between women and men may help explain the observed sex-difference in NHL. Analyses that clarify the association among reproductive factors, use of estrogen-related therapies and risk of NHL and NHL subtypes in women and whether the relationship between NHL risk and sex-related hormones is altered by variation in genes important in hormone metabolism/production and immune function will improve our understanding of NHL development, help to generate new hypotheses for future research and will be directly applicable to prevention, intervention and screening programs with a goal to reduce NHL incidence.           Project Narrative Incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is higher in men than in women and few risk factors have been established other than those associated with severe immunosuppression and some rare genetic conditions.

"Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California Population-based biobanks are a critical resource for identifying disease mechanisms and developing screening tests for biomarkers associated with certain disorders. The California Department of Public Health has been banking newborn specimens statewide since 1982 (N~14 million) and maternal prenatal specimens for a portion of the state since 2000 (N~1 million), creating one of the largest, if not the largest single biological specimen banks with linked data in the world. With the fast pace of new knowledge in genetics and laboratory methods, the demand for specimens and data from researchers around the world now far surpasses the Department's ability to fill them. The goal of this infrastructure development project is to create an efficient, high throughput, low cost newborn screening and prenatal/maternal screening specimen biobank and linked data base that could be used by large numbers of researchers around the world for a wide range of studies through the following aims: (1) establishment of highly efficient protocols and procurement and integration of automated systems for pulling and processing specimens; (2) development of an integrated specimen tracking system into the Department's existing web-based Screening Information System; (3) development of a computerized system to track application requests for specimens and data; and (4) development of a linked screening program-vital records database that is organized into a life course, client based system. These aims will be accomplished through expansion of the Department's award-winning Screening Integration System to include web-based tracking of specimens and research requests, and use of an innovative machine-learning record matching application for high-performance linkages. After the 2 year grant period is completed, the California Research Ready Biospecimen Bank will be able to provide researchers with valuable biological specimens in a timely, cost-effective manner, thereby enabling a dramatic expansion of epidemiological research nationwide. The continuity of the system will be ensured by codifying human subjects-sensitive policies and procedures into Departmental regulations and by charging researchers modest fees for specimens, data and other research services.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of a research-ready pregnancy and newborn biobank in California This proposal funds infrastructure development to create a research-ready, efficient, high- throughput, and low-cost prenatal and newborn biobank in California.

"Help Seeking Behavior in College Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A significant problem with health implications is intimate partner violence (IPV). College women are at greater risk for intimate partner violence, rape and other forms of sexual assault, usually in dating experiences, than women in the general population or in a comparable age group 1, 2. Despite campus prevention and intervention programs, the majority of college women do not report their DV to campus or local authorities and many do not seek needed health care or mental health services 3, 4. Limited research explores help seeking behavior, defined as any behavior that one uses to solve a problem, in college women, especially related to violence 5. The purpose of this project is to determine the significant attitudes and beliefs that are associated with reporting of dating violence in college women. Achieving this goal will guide future research developing and testing effective prevention and intervention strategies to facilitate and increase reporting of dating violence in this population. The proposed study uses an exploratory design, guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), to test the relationship of attitudes and beliefs with the help seeking behavior of reporting dating violence and to describe dating violence help seeking behavior of college women. Specific aims and hypotheses are as follows. Aim 1) to determine significant attitudes and beliefs associated with the help seeking behavior of reporting DV Hypothesis 1) it is expected that a positive relationship of moderate strength will exist between intention to report and a) positive normative beliefs about help seeking, b) lower perceived barriers to help seeking, c) increased cognitive beliefs about DV. Aim 2) to identify the significant attitudes and beliefs that differentiate between individuals with intention to report violence and those who do not intend to report violence. Hypothesis 2) individuals who intend to report DV will be more likely to have increased mental health symptoms of somatization, anxiety depression and general psychological distress and lower levels of social support than individuals who are not likely to report violence. Aim 3) to identify the significant attitudes and beliefs that differentiate between victims with intention to report violence and those who do not intend to report violence. Hypothesis 3) victims who intend to report DV will be more likely to have experienced significantly higher levels of violence, increased mental health symptoms of somatization, anxiety depression and general psychological distress and lower levels of social support than victims who are not likely to report violence; Aim 4) to describe the formal and informal help seeking behavior of victims of dating violence. A nonprobability purposive sample of 2500 college women will be recruited for an electronic survey. Hypotheses will be tested, using logistic regression. Determining significant attitudes and beliefs that predict DV help seeking is necessary to develop interventions that are clinically meaningful and theoretically driven.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance to Public Health Violence against women is a significant public health and societal issue. Experiencing DV is associated with immediate and long term physical and mental health consequences. Many victims do not disclose their experience or seek healthcare or mental health counseling. When violence is undetected and treatment is not provided, the health consequences increase. Past experiences of violence predict future experiences of violence. Limited research explores dating violence help seeking of college women. The proposed project seeks to enhance primary and secondary prevention by providing theoretically driven and clinically relevant intervention strategies. The proposed study offers a conceptual base to understand the attitudes and beliefs associated with reporting and disclosing intimate partner violence and the influence of friends and peers. The knowledge gained from this theory-driven study will aid in the planning of an intervention program to target specific attitudes and beliefs in order to increase reporting and disclosing intimate partner violence. Health professionals will use the findings to enhance the screening and surveillance procedures for identifying individuals who have experienced intimate partner violence. It is clear from the literature that college students experience IPV and experience health consequences. Therefore, it is important to determine ways to increase identification of victims so that services can be provided.           Relevance to Public Health Violence against women is a significant public health and societal issue.

"Institutional Collaboration between LSTM and CDC and Prevention on Malaria(U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal outlines continued collaboration between the Malaria Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Malaria Epidemiology Section of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) to support CDC partners in malaria endemic countries in the conduct of collaborative research to improve the control of malaria in Africa and in Indonesia and to coordinate international research initiatives for malaria control.  LSTM, on behalf of the Malaria in Pregnancy (MiP) Consortium, will coordinate research strategy development between CDC and other International partners in Europe, Australia and endemic countries for future studies of the control of malaria in pregnancy. In addition, a range of research projects will be conducted jointly between LSTM, CDC and the overseas partners of CDC in Indonesia (the Eijkman Institute, Jakarta) and in western Kenya (KEMRI-CDC field station). These fall under three main objectives: malaria control; malaria in pregnancy; and integrated disease control, following the outline of the original call. Several projects start in year 1 and reflect an extension of the joint activities as part of the existing cooperative agreement (CoAg) between LSTM and CDC's Malaria Branch. These include a study to develop tools to monitor antimalarial drug safety in early pregnancy and a survey to evaluate a new rapid assessment toolkit for the evaluation of access, delivery and use of interventions for malaria in pregnancy, both in western Kenya; the central coordination of a multi-country observational study in Africa to determine the effect of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance on intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) effectiveness, and two studies in Indonesia: a) a study evaluating the use of cell-phone technology to improve malaria surveillance by village based health-care workers in remote settings in Indonesia; b) evaluation of the performance of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for the control of malaria in pregnancy in remote settings. In addition, grant proposals will be written in years 1 and 2 to generate research funds for the activities planned in years 2-5, including studies of integrated approaches to disease control which combine screening for HIV with scheduled screening for malaria, syphilis and anemia, and use of intermittent screening and treatment of malaria in pregnancy. During the course of the CoAg, LSTM will provide technical support to CDC as requested for specific pharmacokinetic studies in HIV- infected adults, in children (age-based dosing) and in pregnant women (Mefloquine). Lastly, the activities include formal PhD training of individuals and short-term training in clinical trial methodology. LSTM will also continue to provide technical advice to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Roll Back Malaria (RBM) in support of scaling up of malaria control interventions globally.              Project Narrative Collaboration between malaria Branch of CDC and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine to conduct research to improve the control of malaria in high risk populations, with a special emphasis on studies of the treatment and prevention of malaria in pregnancy in Indonesia and Kenya.",Institutional Collaboration between LSTM and CDC and Prevention on Malaria(U01),8029719,U01CK000146,[' '],NCEZID,TMLIVERPOOL SCHOOL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE,U01,2010,150000,442853,0.08741879788005495
"Help Seeking Behavior in College Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A significant problem with health implications is intimate partner violence (IPV). College women are at greater risk for intimate partner violence, rape and other forms of sexual assault, usually in dating experiences, than women in the general population or in a comparable age group 1, 2. Despite campus prevention and intervention programs, the majority of college women do not report their DV to campus or local authorities and many do not seek needed health care or mental health services 3, 4. Limited research explores help seeking behavior, defined as any behavior that one uses to solve a problem, in college women, especially related to violence 5. The purpose of this project is to determine the significant attitudes and beliefs that are associated with reporting of dating violence in college women. Achieving this goal will guide future research developing and testing effective prevention and intervention strategies to facilitate and increase reporting of dating violence in this population.

"Epidemiology of Stress and GDM among Latina Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes and obesity have reached epidemic proportions in the U.S. with rates consistently higher in Latinas than non-Latina whites. Shifting the prevention period for these conditions upstream, to pregnancy, may be an innovative strategy. The major aims of this proposal are to evaluate new and timely hypotheses regarding modifiable determinants of GDM among Latina women. We propose to evaluate the association between external stressors (physical activity), internal stressors (psychosocial stress), and mediators between these variables and risk of GDM.   Using a prospective cohort design, 2,300 Latina (predominantly Puerto Rican) prenatal care patients will be recruited from Baystate Medical Center at their first prenatal care visit (8-12 weeks gestation). Bilingual interviewers will obtain detailed information on physical activity patterns via the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ) (NIH/NICHD R03-39341) developed and validated for use in this population. Psychosocial stress will be assessed through 1) self-report (life events, perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and self-esteem) using scales validated in Latina populations, and 2) salivary cortisol, a physiologic marker of response to stress. Information on pregravid BMI, diet, cigarette smoking, substance abuse, medical and obstetric history, acculturation, and sociodemographic factors will also be queried. Weight and waist circumference will be measured. Two subsequent interviews, conducted at the time of routine ultrasound (18-20 weeks gestation) and GDM screen (24-28 weeks gestation), will update information on the variables of interest and repeat the salivary cortisol collection. A gestational-age stratified sample of 100 women from the cohort will be selected to assess diurnal variation in the cortisol measure. Lab reports will be abstracted for GDM screen results and a 4th interview will be conducted at 32-34 weeks gestation among those with elevated screening glucose. After delivery, medical records will be abstracted to confirm incident GDM and birth outcomes. Logistic regression will be used to assess the relationship between physical activity, psychosocial stress and GDM risk. Marginal structural models will assess the role of diet, body fat distribution, weight gain, and smoking as mediating variables in the relationship between stress and GDM. Cortisol will be analyzed in a nested case-control fashion on 116 GDM cases and a matched 4:1 sample of controls. A secondary analysis will prospectively assess the relationship between stress and adverse birth outcomes in among women with elevated screening glucose.  The proposed study builds upon our experience in the Latina GDM Study (American Diabetes Association Career Award) and extends the work of prior investigations through prospective assessment at multiple points in gestation, a multidimensional approach to stress measurement, and detailed evaluation of potential confounding and mediating factors in a large, high-risk population.

"Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California Population-based biobanks are a critical resource for identifying disease mechanisms and developing screening tests for biomarkers associated with certain disorders. The California Department of Public Health has been banking newborn specimens statewide since 1982 (N~14 million) and maternal prenatal specimens for a portion of the state since 2000 (N~1 million), creating one of the largest, if not the largest single biological specimen banks with linked data in the world. With the fast pace of new knowledge in genetics and laboratory methods, the demand for specimens and data from researchers around the world now far surpasses the Department's ability to fill them. The goal of this infrastructure development project is to create an efficient, high throughput, low cost newborn screening and prenatal/maternal screening specimen biobank and linked data base that could be used by large numbers of researchers around the world for a wide range of studies through the following aims: (1) establishment of highly efficient protocols and procurement and integration of automated systems for pulling and processing specimens; (2) development of an integrated specimen tracking system into the Department's existing web-based Screening Information System; (3) development of a computerized system to track application requests for specimens and data; and (4) development of a linked screening program-vital records database that is organized into a life course, client based system. These aims will be accomplished through expansion of the Department's award-winning Screening Integration System to include web-based tracking of specimens and research requests, and use of an innovative machine-learning record matching application for high-performance linkages. After the 2 year grant period is completed, the California Research Ready Biospecimen Bank will be able to provide researchers with valuable biological specimens in a timely, cost-effective manner, thereby enabling a dramatic expansion of epidemiological research nationwide. The continuity of the system will be ensured by codifying human subjects-sensitive policies and procedures into Departmental regulations and by charging researchers modest fees for specimens, data and other research services.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of a research-ready pregnancy and newborn biobank in California This proposal funds infrastructure development to create a research-ready, efficient, high- throughput, and low-cost prenatal and newborn biobank in California.

"Fragile X Premutations Among Women Diagnosed with Diminished Ovarian Reserve    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  About 10% of women who are unable to get pregnant are diagnosed with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR). DOR describes a reduction in ovarian function. Few women (<5%) with this diagnosis will become pregnant spontaneously and they do not respond normally to fertility drugs. There are no effective treatments to reverse this condition. Women with DOR may have a premutation alteration of the Fragile X gene (""carriers""). Carriers of this premutation are also at increased risk for premature ovarian failure (POF), which is a greater degree of ovarian dysfunction than DOR. About 5-6% of the women with POF are premutation carriers (14% if she has a family history of premature menopause; 2% otherwise). It is unknown what percentage of women with DOR are premutation carriers. We will extend the current Fragile X research on POF to the DOR population. Specific aims of this study are: (1) to determine the prevalence of the Fragile X premutation among DOR women; (2) to determine if the prevalence varies with a family history of early menopause and/or infertility; and (3) to determine if there is a relationship between patient age, follicle stimulating hormone level, and the ""size"" of the premutation. In this prospective cohort, 65 eligible DOR patients will be enrolled from three academic medical centers (Virginia, North Carolina) and one private practice. The protocol includes pretest genetic counseling, a blood sample for Fragile X testing, and questionnaires. No blood test results will be filed in the medical charts, and women will have the option of learning their Fragile X test results or not. Post test genetic counseling will be provided to all carriers. We are currently pilot-testing this study; among our first 16 participants, one is a carrier and 15 have wanted to learn their test results. The statistical analysis will consist of proportions with binomial testing, logistic regression models, and linear regression models.

"Epidemiology of Stress and GDM among Latina Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes and obesity have reached epidemic proportions in the U.S. with rates consistently higher in Latinas than non-Latina whites. Shifting the prevention period for these conditions upstream, to pregnancy, may be an innovative strategy. The major aims of this proposal are to evaluate new and timely hypotheses regarding modifiable determinants of GDM among Latina women. We propose to evaluate the association between external stressors (physical activity), internal stressors (psychosocial stress), and mediators between these variables and risk of GDM.   Using a prospective cohort design, 2,300 Latina (predominantly Puerto Rican) prenatal care patients will be recruited from Baystate Medical Center at their first prenatal care visit (8-12 weeks gestation). Bilingual interviewers will obtain detailed information on physical activity patterns via the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ) (NIH/NICHD R03-39341) developed and validated for use in this population. Psychosocial stress will be assessed through 1) self-report (life events, perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and self-esteem) using scales validated in Latina populations, and 2) salivary cortisol, a physiologic marker of response to stress. Information on pregravid BMI, diet, cigarette smoking, substance abuse, medical and obstetric history, acculturation, and sociodemographic factors will also be queried. Weight and waist circumference will be measured. Two subsequent interviews, conducted at the time of routine ultrasound (18-20 weeks gestation) and GDM screen (24-28 weeks gestation), will update information on the variables of interest and repeat the salivary cortisol collection. A gestational-age stratified sample of 100 women from the cohort will be selected to assess diurnal variation in the cortisol measure. Lab reports will be abstracted for GDM screen results and a 4th interview will be conducted at 32-34 weeks gestation among those with elevated screening glucose. After delivery, medical records will be abstracted to confirm incident GDM and birth outcomes. Logistic regression will be used to assess the relationship between physical activity, psychosocial stress and GDM risk. Marginal structural models will assess the role of diet, body fat distribution, weight gain, and smoking as mediating variables in the relationship between stress and GDM. Cortisol will be analyzed in a nested case-control fashion on 116 GDM cases and a matched 4:1 sample of controls. A secondary analysis will prospectively assess the relationship between stress and adverse birth outcomes in among women with elevated screening glucose.  The proposed study builds upon our experience in the Latina GDM Study (American Diabetes Association Career Award) and extends the work of prior investigations through prospective assessment at multiple points in gestation, a multidimensional approach to stress measurement, and detailed evaluation of potential confounding and mediating factors in a large, high-risk population.

"Fragile X Premutations Among Women Diagnosed with Diminished Ovarian Reserve    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  About 10% of women who are unable to get pregnant are diagnosed with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR). DOR describes a reduction in ovarian function. Few women (<5%) with this diagnosis will become pregnant spontaneously and they do not respond normally to fertility drugs. There are no effective treatments to reverse this condition. Women with DOR may have a premutation alteration of the Fragile X gene (""carriers""). Carriers of this premutation are also at increased risk for premature ovarian failure (POF), which is a greater degree of ovarian dysfunction than DOR. About 5-6% of the women with POF are premutation carriers (14% if she has a family history of premature menopause; 2% otherwise). It is unknown what percentage of women with DOR are premutation carriers. We will extend the current Fragile X research on POF to the DOR population. Specific aims of this study are: (1) to determine the prevalence of the Fragile X premutation among DOR women; (2) to determine if the prevalence varies with a family history of early menopause and/or infertility; and (3) to determine if there is a relationship between patient age, follicle stimulating hormone level, and the ""size"" of the premutation. In this prospective cohort, 65 eligible DOR patients will be enrolled from three academic medical centers (Virginia, North Carolina) and one private practice. The protocol includes pretest genetic counseling, a blood sample for Fragile X testing, and questionnaires. No blood test results will be filed in the medical charts, and women will have the option of learning their Fragile X test results or not. Post test genetic counseling will be provided to all carriers. We are currently pilot-testing this study; among our first 16 participants, one is a carrier and 15 have wanted to learn their test results. The statistical analysis will consist of proportions with binomial testing, logistic regression models, and linear regression models. This research may identify a new phenotype from Fragile X premutations, begin the development of a clinical tool to predict age-at-infertility among carriers, and enhance reproductive planning and decision-making by carriers. The implications of fertility treatment to Fragile X carriers is notable in terms of transmitting Fragile X Syndrome to the children born via fertility treatment; therefore, this research also has applications to the greater issue of the impact on society and individuals from unanticipated genetic testing.          n/a",Fragile X Premutations Among Women Diagnosed with Diminished Ovarian Reserve,7195967,R03HD052768,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood specimen', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Conceptions', 'Condition', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disclosure', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Estrogens', 'Etiology', 'Extramural Activities', 'FMR1 Gene', 'Failure', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'Female infertility', 'Fertility', 'Fertility Agents', 'Fertilization in Vitro', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Premutation', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Hormonal', 'Individual', 'Infertility', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Menopause', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neonatal Screening', 'North Carolina', 'Numbers', 'Ovarian', 'Ovarian hormone', 'Ovary', 'Participant', 'Patient currently pregnant', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Premature Menopause', 'Premature Ovarian Failure', 'Prevalence', 'Private Practice', 'Protocols documentation', 'Purpose', 'Questionnaires', 'Rate', 'Reaction', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Screening procedure', 'Second Degree Relative', 'Societies', 'Son', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virginia', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'cohort', 'day', 'experience', 'improved', 'prospective', 'racial/ethnic difference', 'reproductive', 'size', 'success', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R03,2007,83008,169622494,0.05911370202184361

"Acupuncture/Reproductive Hormones/Ovulation/Polycystic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Polycystic Ovary Disease (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder among reproductive age women, and is the most common cause of irregular cycles and anovulatory infertility. Acupuncture may represent an alternative to hormonal treatment for these women, based on three studies with positive findings with fewer than 50 acupuncture subjects and no control group. The best of these studies examined 24 PCOS women and found that 38% of the women had restored ovulation (2+ ovulations) during the treatment plus follow-up time period. The proposed research will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial to assess if acupuncture restores ovulation (2+ ovulations) and normalizes ovarian hormones in women v/ith PCOS. Participants (n=78 completers) will be randomized to receive either acupuncture treatment or a sham procedure (Park Sham Device) for a standard 8-week period of time. All participants will provide blood samples through the University of Virginia General Clinical Research Center before treatment, after treatment, and three months later from which reproductive hormones, androgens and insulin/glucose will be assayed. Urine samples will be provided weekly throughout the treatment and follow-up periods to determine if ovulation has occurred. To collect data on potential confounders, weight will be measured and questionnaires administered at the same three time periods as the blood samples. Results will be analyzed with a combination of odds ratios, multiple logistic regression, repeated measures analyses, generalized estimating equations, and analysis of covariance. This study will be a clear enhancement compared to the existing literature by inclusion of a sham treatment control group, rigorous diagnosis of PCOS, and collection of blood samples timed to the menstrual cycle (applicable when there is an ovulatory cycle). This research will assess within our PCOS population whether acupuncture increases ovulatory frequency, causes the ratio of follicle simulating hormone (FSH) to luteinizing hormone (LH) to normalize, and causes the mean levels of FSH and LH to adjust towards normal levels (increase and decrease, respectively). Toward future research, an exploratory analysis will also be conducted to estimate if some patient groups (e.g., normal insulin, smaller body mass index) are more responsive to acupuncture therapy. We will also compare enrollment strategies for population-based recruitment of women into an acupuncture clinical trial.         n/a",Acupuncture/Reproductive Hormones/Ovulation/Polycystic,7274714,R21AT002520,"['Acupuncture Therapy', 'Acupuncture procedure', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Androgens', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Control Groups', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Endocrine System Diseases', 'Enrollment', 'Equation', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Hour', 'Infertility', 'Insulin', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Luteinizing Hormone', 'Measures', 'Menstrual cycle', 'OGTT', 'Odds Ratio', 'Ovarian', 'Ovarian hormone', 'Ovulation', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Placebo Control', 'Placebos', 'Plasma', 'Polycystic Ovary Syndrome', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Prolactin', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin', 'Simulate', 'Smoking Status', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Syndrome', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Virginia', 'Week', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'base', 'follow-up', 'interest', 'reproductive', 'reproductive hormone', 'treatment duration']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R21,2007,148916,169622494,0.06528813051289473
"Teratogenicity of Drugs Most Commonly Used in Pregnancy Acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, and amoxicillin are among the most commonly used drugs during pregnancy, but the safety of these medications with respect to birth defects is not established. Given the wide use of these drugs, even a small increase in the risk of birth defects may have considerable clinical and public health implications. We propose to evaluate the association between these drugs and 1) specific malformations previously hypothesized to be associated with each of them, and 2) specific malformations that occur most commonly in the general population. In addition, we propose to evaluate other commonly used medications by systematically screening each exposure in relation to the risk of specific malformations. These goals can be achieved at relatively modest cost by taking advantage of a large existing ongoing multicenter case-control surveillance program of birth defects in North America, the Slone Epidemiology Center Birth Defects Study (BDS). The BDS involves approximately 95 institutions in four metropolitan areas (Boston, Philadelphia, Toronto, and San Diego), and for over 25 years has interviewed over 20,000 mothers of malformed infants and over 4,000 mothers of non-malformed infants. The BDS identifies infants with a wide range of malformations within 5 months after birth at tertiary and birth hospitals, and within 6 months of delivery, study nurses interview mothers about demographic, reproductive, and medical factors; medication and vitamin use; cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption; and dietary intake. The study has discovered likely teratogenic effects that have subsequently been confirmed by others (e.g., salycilates in relation to gastroschisis). In the proposed analyses, we will estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals using logistic regression, and results will be adjusted for potential confounders. Findings will test hypotheses about some drugs and provide leads for further research for others; both objectives seek to improve our understanding of risks associated with drugs commonly used by pregnant women. n/a",Teratogenicity of Drugs Most Commonly Used in Pregnancy,7153491,R01HD046595,"['Acetaminophen', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Amoxicillin', 'Area', 'Aspirin', 'Birth', 'Boston', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Dietary intake', 'Drug usage', 'Epidemiology', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Gastroschisis', 'General Population', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Ibuprofen', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Interview', 'Limb structure', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Mothers', 'Neural Tube Defects', 'North America', 'Nurses', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Philadelphia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Public Health', 'Range', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Savings', 'Screening procedure', 'Subgroup', 'Surveillance Program', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vitamins', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'cost', 'improved', 'malformation', 'metropolitan', 'oral cleft', 'prescription document', 'prescription procedure', 'reproductive']",NICHD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2007,264692,164685352,0.02913290349774514
"Molecular epidemiology of cervical adenocarcinoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this project is to improve the biologic understanding of adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous cancer of the cervix uteri (in the following referred to as adenocarcinoma) through investigation of its viral etiology, and genes encoding certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes. The long-term objective is to propose rational prevention strategies for this disease. Our main specific aims are to: 1) estimate the relative risks for adenocarcinoma both as a function of HPV presence overall and as a function of time since first detected infection with human papillomavirus (HPV); 2) to assess whether persistence and/or a high initial HPV 16/18/45 viral load is a determinant of adenocarcinoma; 3) to assess whether certain HLA haplotypes are associated with risk for adenocarcinoma, and if the association is mediated via a higher viral load and/or persistence of HPV 16/18/45. This project will build on experience from two previous studies examining squamous cell cervical cancer and HPV (both funded by NIH). Our capacity to conduct these studies is derived from the utilization of unique prerequisites in Sweden, namely the extensive documentation present in computerized registers for population-based PAP-smear screening, potential ascertainment of all incident cases of adenocarcinoma, and access to archival smears and tissue specimens. Using a nested case-control design in this large study base, with up to 32 years of complete follow-up, 511 women with adenocarcinoma and 511 individually matched control women will be identified.      Using validated and sensitive PCR-assays, the presence of HPV DNA will be analyzed in all available smears from each participant (on an average four smears per individual, giving totally about 4,088 smears).HPV persistence, HPV16/18/45 viral load and HLA (types DQ6 and DR15) will be analyzed for all included women.

"Epidemiology of Stress and GDM among Latina Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes and obesity have reached epidemic proportions in the U.S. with rates consistently higher in Latinas than non-Latina whites. Shifting the prevention period for these conditions upstream, to pregnancy, may be an innovative strategy. The major aims of this proposal are to evaluate new and timely hypotheses regarding modifiable determinants of GDM among Latina women. We propose to evaluate the association between external stressors (physical activity), internal stressors (psychosocial stress), and mediators between these variables and risk of GDM.   Using a prospective cohort design, 2,300 Latina (predominantly Puerto Rican) prenatal care patients will be recruited from Baystate Medical Center at their first prenatal care visit (8-12 weeks gestation). Bilingual interviewers will obtain detailed information on physical activity patterns via the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ) (NIH/NICHD R03-39341) developed and validated for use in this population. Psychosocial stress will be assessed through 1) self-report (life events, perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and self-esteem) using scales validated in Latina populations, and 2) salivary cortisol, a physiologic marker of response to stress. Information on pregravid BMI, diet, cigarette smoking, substance abuse, medical and obstetric history, acculturation, and sociodemographic factors will also be queried. Weight and waist circumference will be measured. Two subsequent interviews, conducted at the time of routine ultrasound (18-20 weeks gestation) and GDM screen (24-28 weeks gestation), will update information on the variables of interest and repeat the salivary cortisol collection. A gestational-age stratified sample of 100 women from the cohort will be selected to assess diurnal variation in the cortisol measure. Lab reports will be abstracted for GDM screen results and a 4th interview will be conducted at 32-34 weeks gestation among those with elevated screening glucose. After delivery, medical records will be abstracted to confirm incident GDM and birth outcomes. Logistic regression will be used to assess the relationship between physical activity, psychosocial stress and GDM risk. Marginal structural models will assess the role of diet, body fat distribution, weight gain, and smoking as mediating variables in the relationship between stress and GDM. Cortisol will be analyzed in a nested case-control fashion on 116 GDM cases and a matched 4:1 sample of controls. A secondary analysis will prospectively assess the relationship between stress and adverse birth outcomes in among women with elevated screening glucose.  The proposed study builds upon our experience in the Latina GDM Study (American Diabetes Association Career Award) and extends the work of prior investigations through prospective assessment at multiple points in gestation, a multidimensional approach to stress measurement, and detailed evaluation of potential confounding and mediating factors in a large, high-risk population.

"Promoting Breast Cancer Screening Via Computer V Phone DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the percentage of US women who have had at least one mammogram is rising, there is still a cadre of women who have never been screened, and adherence for routine repeat screening that will decrease mortality is poor. We need to identify mammography interventions that are effective for facilitating routine repeat screening, acceptable to women, and cost-effective for health care providers, managed-care organizations and insurers. In previous research, mammography-promotion interventions delivered via computer programs and telephone counseling have each led to increases in screening but, to date, neither their behavioral outcomes nor their cost effectiveness has been evaluated in direct comparison with each other.  This study will compare outcomes from a mammography intervention delivered by computer (CD-ROM) versus telephone. Approximately 1,686 women who are age-eligible for mammography, enrolled in a managed care organization or a large insurance plan, and have not had a mammogram within the previous 15 months will be enrolled in the study. Women will be randomly assigned to receive: (1) a mammography promotion intervention delivered via interactive computer program; (2) the intervention delivered via telephone; or (3) usual care. Computer and telephone interventions will be tailored to recipients' perceptions of susceptibility, benefits and barriers associated with mammography, and perceived self-efficacy for obtaining a mammogram. Women in the computer and telephone groups will receive ""booster"" interventions 12 months after their first intervention.  We will conduct process and outcome evaluations. Outcomes will include mammography adherence and stage of mammography adoption and intervention cost-effectiveness.

"Acupuncture/Reproductive Hormones/Ovulation/Polycystic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Polycystic Ovary Disease (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder among reproductive age women, and is the most common cause of irregular cycles and anovulatory infertility. Acupuncture may represent an alternative to hormonal treatment for these women, based on three studies with positive findings with fewer than 50 acupuncture subjects and no control group. The best of these studies examined 24 PCOS women and found that 38% of the women had restored ovulation (2+ ovulations) during the treatment plus follow-up time period. The proposed research will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial to assess if acupuncture restores ovulation (2+ ovulations) and normalizes ovarian hormones in women v/ith PCOS. Participants (n=78 completers) will be randomized to receive either acupuncture treatment or a sham procedure (Park Sham Device) for a standard 8-week period of time. All participants will provide blood samples through the University of Virginia General Clinical Research Center before treatment, after treatment, and three months later from which reproductive hormones, androgens and insulin/glucose will be assayed. Urine samples will be provided weekly throughout the treatment and follow-up periods to determine if ovulation has occurred. To collect data on potential confounders, weight will be measured and questionnaires administered at the same three time periods as the blood samples. Results will be analyzed with a combination of odds ratios, multiple logistic regression, repeated measures analyses, generalized estimating equations, and analysis of covariance. This study will be a clear enhancement compared to the existing literature by inclusion of a sham treatment control group, rigorous diagnosis of PCOS, and collection of blood samples timed to the menstrual cycle (applicable when there is an ovulatory cycle). This research will assess within our PCOS population whether acupuncture increases ovulatory frequency, causes the ratio of follicle simulating hormone (FSH) to luteinizing hormone (LH) to normalize, and causes the mean levels of FSH and LH to adjust towards normal levels (increase and decrease, respectively). Toward future research, an exploratory analysis will also be conducted to estimate if some patient groups (e.g., normal insulin, smaller body mass index) are more responsive to acupuncture therapy. We will also compare enrollment strategies for population-based recruitment of women into an acupuncture clinical trial.         n/a",Acupuncture/Reproductive Hormones/Ovulation/Polycystic,7140060,R21AT002520,"['acupuncture /acupressure', 'alternative medicine', 'clinical research', 'clinical trials', 'female', 'follicle stimulating hormone', 'hormone regulation /control mechanism', 'human subject', 'human therapy evaluation', 'luteinizing hormone', 'ovulation', 'patient oriented research', 'pituitary gonadal axis', 'polycystic ovary syndrome']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CHARLOTTESVILLE,R21,2006,201729,0,0.06528813051289473
"Teratogenicity of Drugs Most Commonly Used in Pregnancy Acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, and amoxicillin are among the most commonly used drugs during pregnancy, but the safety of these medications with respect to birth defects is not established. Given the wide use of these drugs, even a small increase in the risk of birth defects may have considerable clinical and public health implications. We propose to evaluate the association between these drugs and 1) specific malformations previously hypothesized to be associated with each of them, and 2) specific malformations that occur most commonly in the general population. In addition, we propose to evaluate other commonly used medications by systematically screening each exposure in relation to the risk of specific malformations. These goals can be achieved at relatively modest cost by taking advantage of a large existing ongoing multicenter case-control surveillance program of birth defects in North America, the Slone Epidemiology Center Birth Defects Study (BDS). The BDS involves approximately 95 institutions in four metropolitan areas (Boston, Philadelphia, Toronto, and San Diego), and for over 25 years has interviewed over 20,000 mothers of malformed infants and over 4,000 mothers of non-malformed infants. The BDS identifies infants with a wide range of malformations within 5 months after birth at tertiary and birth hospitals, and within 6 months of delivery, study nurses interview mothers about demographic, reproductive, and medical factors; medication and vitamin use; cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption; and dietary intake. The study has discovered likely teratogenic effects that have subsequently been confirmed by others (e.g., salycilates in relation to gastroschisis). In the proposed analyses, we will estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals using logistic regression, and results will be adjusted for potential confounders. Findings will test hypotheses about some drugs and provide leads for further research for others; both objectives seek to improve our understanding of risks associated with drugs commonly used by pregnant women. n/a",Teratogenicity of Drugs Most Commonly Used in Pregnancy,6979792,R01HD046595,"['acetaminophen', 'aspirin', 'cleft palate', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'congenital cardiovascular disorder', 'congenital nervous system disorder', 'congenital reproductive system disorder', 'congenital skeletal disorder', 'embryo /fetus drug adverse effect', 'gestational age', 'human data', 'human pregnant subject', 'ibuprofen', 'penicillins', 'pregnancy', 'pregnancy disorder chemotherapy', 'self medication', 'statistics /biometry', 'teratogens']",NICHD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2006,272621,164685352,0.02913290349774514
"Periodontal Disease and Prematurity    DESCRIPTION: Babies who are born prematurely and/or are underweight at birth are 20-80 times more likely to die before their first birthday. A significant proportion of preterm deliveries occur in women who are free of known risk factors. Periodontal disease is emerging as a potential risk factor although the results from human studies are equivocal. The long-term objective of this research is to further evaluate the extent to which the infections of periodontal origin play a role in preterm delivery. The primary Specific Aims of this project are 1) to measure the association between periodontal pathogens in cervical and vaginal samples of pregnant women and preterm birth, and 2) to measure the association between prenatal maternal serum IgG levels against specific periodontal pathogens and preterm birth. These Aims will be accomplished by conducting a nested case-control study within a large ongoing cohort study at the New York University Medical School (March-of-Dimes Study). Frozen serum and cervico-vaginal samples, data on biochemical markers such as IL-6, IL-8, TNFalpha, and Thrombin-antithrombin complexes, and validated questionnaire data on quality-of-life are available from this study. As of October 1,2003, there were 1579 subjects enrolled in this study and 1054 have already delivered (7% preterm deliveries and 10% low birth weight). Sixty-nine percent were Hispanic and 85% were 19-34 years of age. This study has two more years of enrollment remaining with an estimated 215 new recruits per year. Accordingly, we estimate that by October 2005 there will likely be 140 preterm and 1869 full term deliveries. Three pair-matched controls for each preterm delivery case will be selected from the full-term delivery subjects based on age, race, and date of delivery. Periodontal pathogens will be measured in cervico-vaginal samples using a checkerboard assay, and periodontal pathogen-specific IgG levels will be measured in serum samples using ELISA. Conditional logistic regression analysis will be used in the data analysis. As a secondary Aim, on an exploratory basis, levels of periodontal pathogens in oral, cervical, and vaginal samples, and periodontal pathogen specific serum IgG levels will be correlated with each other and also with preterm birth using fresh samples collected from the subjects that will be recruited to the March-of-Dimes Study after this application is funded (October 04-Oct 05; N=215). The proposed research is important because it will help identify the nature and the strength of the association between preterm delivery and periodontal disease-related factors which are modifiable in comparison to a majority of obstetrical risk factors that are not as easily changed. These associations have potential application in the early diagnosis and prevention of preterm deliveries. A major strength of the study is the efficacy gained by utilizing existing data and samples from a large cohort study. The collective expertise of the investigative team and the excellent clinical and research facilities are additional strengths.      n/a",Periodontal Disease and Prematurity,7053359,R01DE015594,"['bacterial disease', 'clinical research', 'comorbidity', 'enzyme linked immunosorbent assay', 'female', 'human subject', 'immunoglobulin G', 'periodontium disorder', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'pregnancy infection', 'premature labor', 'women&apos', 's health']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2006,316973,77336088,0.038215457915277466

"Molecular epidemiology of cervical adenocarcinoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this project is to improve the biologic understanding of adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous cancer of the cervix uteri (in the following referred to as adenocarcinoma) through investigation of its viral etiology, and genes encoding certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes. The long-term objective is to propose rational prevention strategies for this disease. Our main specific aims are to: 1) estimate the relative risks for adenocarcinoma both as a function of HPV presence overall and as a function of time since first detected infection with human papillomavirus (HPV); 2) to assess whether persistence and/or a high initial HPV 16/18/45 viral load is a determinant of adenocarcinoma; 3) to assess whether certain HLA haplotypes are associated with risk for adenocarcinoma, and if the association is mediated via a higher viral load and/or persistence of HPV 16/18/45. This project will build on experience from two previous studies examining squamous cell cervical cancer and HPV (both funded by NIH). Our capacity to conduct these studies is derived from the utilization of unique prerequisites in Sweden, namely the extensive documentation present in computerized registers for population-based PAP-smear screening, potential ascertainment of all incident cases of adenocarcinoma, and access to archival smears and tissue specimens. Using a nested case-control design in this large study base, with up to 32 years of complete follow-up, 511 women with adenocarcinoma and 511 individually matched control women will be identified.      Using validated and sensitive PCR-assays, the presence of HPV DNA will be analyzed in all available smears from each participant (on an average four smears per individual, giving totally about 4,088 smears).HPV persistence, HPV16/18/45 viral load and HLA (types DQ6 and DR15) will be analyzed for all included women. Relative risks of cervical adenocarcinoma for oncogenic HPV infections, HPV persistence,HPV16/18/45 high viral load, HLA haplotype and interactions between these factors will be estimated with conditional logistic regression.

"Mammography Screening Decisions in the Elderly DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The benefits of mammography screening in women age 80 and older are uncertain. Guidelines encourage physicians to consider life expectancy before screening elderly women and to discuss the risks and benefits of screening with their elderly patients. Despite these recommendations, many elderly women are screened even those in poor health. It is unknown why so many elderly women are choosing to be screened and what factors influence this decision. To determine the accuracy of elderly women's knowledge about screening mammography and factors that influence screening decisions, the applicant proposes a two-phase study. Phase 1 uses qualitative methods to develop a survey about mammography screening decisions in the elderly and phase 2 involves administering the survey to a larger sample of women age 80 and older, using women ages 50-69 as a comparison group. Bivariable analyses and multivariable logistic regression will be performed to compare the accuracy of screening knowledge between elderly and younger patients as well as to determine age differences in the influence of several factors on the decision to be screened. This is the first study to explore very elderly women's approach to decisions about screening mammography. n/a",Mammography Screening Decisions in the Elderly,7107006,F32CA110424,"['age difference', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'clinical research', 'data collection', 'decision making', 'female', 'health surveys', 'human middle age (35-64)', 'human old age (65+)', 'human subject', 'interview', 'mammography', 'perception', 'postdoctoral investigator', 'preference', 'women&apos', 's health']",NCI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,F32,2005,1913,135941803,0.03365928810159464

"Secondary Analysis of NC-BCSP Mammography Use Evaluation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The North Carolina Breast Cancer Screening Program (NC-BCSP) has conducted a ten-year effectiveness trial of a natural helper lay health advisor intervention in 10 counties (5 interventions, 5 comparisons) in eastern North Carolina to increase mammography use by low-income, rural, African American women. Three waves (baseline and 2 follow-ups) of interview data collected from a stratified random sample of, initially, 1000 Black women (500 intervention, 500 comparison) indicate that NC-BCSP's lay health advisor intervention was modestly effective overall after 30 months (at first follow-up IT2] in 1997), and associated with a greater increase in recent mammography use among specific subgroups, particularly women with annual family incomes under $12,000.  The proposed exploratory study uses all three waves of cohort data to determine: 1) whether NC-BCSP's intervention effect was sustained over the full 8 years of the evaluation (T1-T3), and for which subgroups; 2) what factors are associated with, and what pathways mediated, the intervention's effect initially (T1 - T2,) and in the second follow-up period (T2-T3); 3) how successfully an existing administrative data set (Medicare) can be used, instead of self-report data, to evaluate intervention effectiveness; and 4) whether geographical proximity, as measured by GIS software, of lay advisors to cohort respondents can serve as a useful proxy for self-report measures of exposure to the lay advisors. Analyses will use multivariate models with logistic regression and generalized estimating equations to account for repeated mammography reports.  The proposed secondary analyses of this unique longitudinal data set will provide valuable insights for designing more effective, better targeted, and more cost-effective interventions to reach the hardest-to-reach rural women still not being screened regularly. The goal of this grant is to understand the differences between continuous users, backsliders, late adopters and non-users of screening mammography, and the mechanisms, which explain variation in these groups' exposure to the intervention and their use, or non-use, of mammography. n/a",Secondary Analysis of NC-BCSP Mammography Use Evaluation,6917000,R21CA098934,"['African American', 'Medicare /Medicaid', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'breast neoplasms', 'clinical research', 'early diagnosis', 'female', 'geographic difference', 'health behavior', 'health care referral /consultation', 'health care service availability', 'health care service evaluation', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'health services research tag', 'human data', 'human old age (65+)', 'longitudinal human study', 'low socioeconomic status', 'mammography', 'medically underserved population', 'physicians', 'rural area', 'social support network']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2005,131400,0,0.019957150030871427
"Acupuncture/Reproductive Hormones/Ovulation/Polycystic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Polycystic Ovary Disease (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder among reproductive age women, and is the most common cause of irregular cycles and anovulatory infertility. Acupuncture may represent an alternative to hormonal treatment for these women, based on three studies with positive findings with fewer than 50 acupuncture subjects and no control group. The best of these studies examined 24 PCOS women and found that 38% of the women had restored ovulation (2+ ovulations) during the treatment plus follow-up time period. The proposed research will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial to assess if acupuncture restores ovulation (2+ ovulations) and normalizes ovarian hormones in women v/ith PCOS. Participants (n=78 completers) will be randomized to receive either acupuncture treatment or a sham procedure (Park Sham Device) for a standard 8-week period of time. All participants will provide blood samples through the University of Virginia General Clinical Research Center before treatment, after treatment, and three months later from which reproductive hormones, androgens and insulin/glucose will be assayed. Urine samples will be provided weekly throughout the treatment and follow-up periods to determine if ovulation has occurred. To collect data on potential confounders, weight will be measured and questionnaires administered at the same three time periods as the blood samples. Results will be analyzed with a combination of odds ratios, multiple logistic regression, repeated measures analyses, generalized estimating equations, and analysis of covariance. This study will be a clear enhancement compared to the existing literature by inclusion of a sham treatment control group, rigorous diagnosis of PCOS, and collection of blood samples timed to the menstrual cycle (applicable when there is an ovulatory cycle). This research will assess within our PCOS population whether acupuncture increases ovulatory frequency, causes the ratio of follicle simulating hormone (FSH) to luteinizing hormone (LH) to normalize, and causes the mean levels of FSH and LH to adjust towards normal levels (increase and decrease, respectively). Toward future research, an exploratory analysis will also be conducted to estimate if some patient groups (e.g., normal insulin, smaller body mass index) are more responsive to acupuncture therapy. We will also compare enrollment strategies for population-based recruitment of women into an acupuncture clinical trial.         n/a",Acupuncture/Reproductive Hormones/Ovulation/Polycystic,6970579,R21AT002520,"['acupuncture /acupressure', 'alternative medicine', 'clinical research', 'clinical trials', 'female', 'follicle stimulating hormone', 'hormone regulation /control mechanism', 'human subject', 'human therapy evaluation', 'luteinizing hormone', 'ovulation', 'patient oriented research', 'pituitary gonadal axis', 'polycystic ovary syndrome']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CHARLOTTESVILLE,R21,2005,206584,0,0.06528813051289473
"Teratogenicity of Drugs Most Commonly Used in Pregnancy Acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, and amoxicillin are among the most commonly used drugs during pregnancy, but the safety of these medications with respect to birth defects is not established. Given the wide use of these drugs, even a small increase in the risk of birth defects may have considerable clinical and public health implications. We propose to evaluate the association between these drugs and 1) specific malformations previously hypothesized to be associated with each of them, and 2) specific malformations that occur most commonly in the general population. In addition, we propose to evaluate other commonly used medications by systematically screening each exposure in relation to the risk of specific malformations. These goals can be achieved at relatively modest cost by taking advantage of a large existing ongoing multicenter case-control surveillance program of birth defects in North America, the Slone Epidemiology Center Birth Defects Study (BDS). The BDS involves approximately 95 institutions in four metropolitan areas (Boston, Philadelphia, Toronto, and San Diego), and for over 25 years has interviewed over 20,000 mothers of malformed infants and over 4,000 mothers of non-malformed infants. The BDS identifies infants with a wide range of malformations within 5 months after birth at tertiary and birth hospitals, and within 6 months of delivery, study nurses interview mothers about demographic, reproductive, and medical factors; medication and vitamin use; cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption; and dietary intake. The study has discovered likely teratogenic effects that have subsequently been confirmed by others (e.g., salycilates in relation to gastroschisis). In the proposed analyses, we will estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals using logistic regression, and results will be adjusted for potential confounders. Findings will test hypotheses about some drugs and provide leads for further research for others; both objectives seek to improve our understanding of risks associated with drugs commonly used by pregnant women. n/a",Teratogenicity of Drugs Most Commonly Used in Pregnancy,6867958,R01HD046595,"['acetaminophen', 'aspirin', 'cleft palate', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'congenital cardiovascular disorder', 'congenital nervous system disorder', 'congenital reproductive system disorder', 'congenital skeletal disorder', 'embryo /fetus drug adverse effect', 'gestational age', 'human data', 'human pregnant subject', 'ibuprofen', 'penicillins', 'pregnancy', 'pregnancy disorder chemotherapy', 'self medication', 'statistics /biometry', 'teratogens']",NICHD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2005,279306,164685352,0.02913290349774514
"Regular Exercise Among Women at Risk for Preeclampsia   DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract): Preeclampsia, the sudden onset of high           blood pressure along with proteinuria during pregnancy, is a serious                 complication affecting nearly one in every 20 pregnancies. It is the main cause      of maternal death worldwide, and affects women of all races and socioeconomic        groups. Unfortunately, no definitive preventive treatment is currently               available for this ominous disease. Scientists now believe that preeclampsia is      a disease of the endothelium, due in part to oxidative stress. As such, regular      exercise has emerged as a potential preventive measure. This contrasts to daily      low dose aspirin or calcium supplement which have failed to demonstrate a            significant effect and may have adverse effects. The purpose of this study is        to determine if moderate intensity exercise during pregnancy will reduce the         incidence of preeclampsia and to assess the process (involving oxidative stress      and antioxidant process) hypothesized to explain the effect of exercise on           preeclampsia. This is a randomized clinical trial with a total of 250 pregnant       subjects at risk for preeclampsia. Eligible subjects will enter a run-in period      (i.e., qualifying period) at 14 to 18 weeks gestation. Baseline data to be           obtained include demographic information, health history, daily physical             activities, cardiovascular fitness level, blood pressure, blood sample for           serum iron, transferrin, low density lipoprotein, malondialdehyde, superoxide        dismutase. At 18 weeks, compliant subjects will be randomly assigned to either       the exercise (40 min., 70 percent VO2max, 5x/week) or sham exercise (control         group; 10 min. stretch exercise, 5x/week) condition. For both groups, all            baseline measurements will be repeated at 28 weeks (Outcome I). Subjects will        continue the exercise regimen after 28 weeks up to her term and as long as it        is safe and comfortable. A blood sample will be collected again during labor         (Outcome II). Subjects who undergo cesarean section for obstetrical reasons          will provide a small amount of subcutaneous tissue at the time of incision to        measure endothelial superoxide dismutase. Medical records will be reviewed for       additional outcome data (pregnancy/birth outcomes and diagnosis of                   preeclampsia). Chi-square tests of association and logistic regression analysis      will be applied to address the effect of exercise, prediction of preeclampsia,       and other pregnancy outcomes. Repeated Measures ANOVA will be applied to assess      the effect of exercise on various biological markers. ANCOVA will be applied to      control confounding factors.                                                                                                                                              n/a",Regular Exercise Among Women at Risk for Preeclampsia,6885777,R01NR005002,"['antioxidants', 'cardiovascular disorder therapy', 'clinical trials', 'disease /disorder proneness /risk', 'erythrocytes', 'exercise', 'female', 'human subject', 'human therapy evaluation', 'lipid peroxides', 'low density lipoprotein', 'oxidative stress', 'patient oriented research', 'preeclampsia', 'superoxide dismutase', 'vascular endothelium', 'women&apos', 's health']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2005,319243,641965656,0.09134051579722667
"Periodontal Disease and Prematurity    DESCRIPTION: Babies who are born prematurely and/or are underweight at birth are 20-80 times more likely to die before their first birthday. A significant proportion of preterm deliveries occur in women who are free of known risk factors. Periodontal disease is emerging as a potential risk factor although the results from human studies are equivocal. The long-term objective of this research is to further evaluate the extent to which the infections of periodontal origin play a role in preterm delivery. The primary Specific Aims of this project are 1) to measure the association between periodontal pathogens in cervical and vaginal samples of pregnant women and preterm birth, and 2) to measure the association between prenatal maternal serum IgG levels against specific periodontal pathogens and preterm birth. These Aims will be accomplished by conducting a nested case-control study within a large ongoing cohort study at the New York University Medical School (March-of-Dimes Study). Frozen serum and cervico-vaginal samples, data on biochemical markers such as IL-6, IL-8, TNFalpha, and Thrombin-antithrombin complexes, and validated questionnaire data on quality-of-life are available from this study. As of October 1,2003, there were 1579 subjects enrolled in this study and 1054 have already delivered (7% preterm deliveries and 10% low birth weight). Sixty-nine percent were Hispanic and 85% were 19-34 years of age. This study has two more years of enrollment remaining with an estimated 215 new recruits per year. Accordingly, we estimate that by October 2005 there will likely be 140 preterm and 1869 full term deliveries. Three pair-matched controls for each preterm delivery case will be selected from the full-term delivery subjects based on age, race, and date of delivery. Periodontal pathogens will be measured in cervico-vaginal samples using a checkerboard assay, and periodontal pathogen-specific IgG levels will be measured in serum samples using ELISA. Conditional logistic regression analysis will be used in the data analysis. As a secondary Aim, on an exploratory basis, levels of periodontal pathogens in oral, cervical, and vaginal samples, and periodontal pathogen specific serum IgG levels will be correlated with each other and also with preterm birth using fresh samples collected from the subjects that will be recruited to the March-of-Dimes Study after this application is funded (October 04-Oct 05; N=215). The proposed research is important because it will help identify the nature and the strength of the association between preterm delivery and periodontal disease-related factors which are modifiable in comparison to a majority of obstetrical risk factors that are not as easily changed. These associations have potential application in the early diagnosis and prevention of preterm deliveries. A major strength of the study is the efficacy gained by utilizing existing data and samples from a large cohort study. The collective expertise of the investigative team and the excellent clinical and research facilities are additional strengths.      n/a",Periodontal Disease and Prematurity,6919155,R01DE015594,"['bacterial disease', 'clinical research', 'comorbidity', 'enzyme linked immunosorbent assay', 'female', 'human subject', 'immunoglobulin G', 'periodontium disorder', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'pregnancy infection', 'premature labor', 'women&apos', 's health']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2005,321788,77336088,0.038215457915277466
"Molecular epidemiology of cervical adenocarcinoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this project is to improve the biologic understanding of adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous cancer of the cervix uteri (in the following referred to as adenocarcinoma) through investigation of its viral etiology, and genes encoding certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes. The long-term objective is to propose rational prevention strategies for this disease. Our main specific aims are to: 1) estimate the relative risks for adenocarcinoma both as a function of HPV presence overall and as a function of time since first detected infection with human papillomavirus (HPV); 2) to assess whether persistence and/or a high initial HPV 16/18/45 viral load is a determinant of adenocarcinoma; 3) to assess whether certain HLA haplotypes are associated with risk for adenocarcinoma, and if the association is mediated via a higher viral load and/or persistence of HPV 16/18/45. This project will build on experience from two previous studies examining squamous cell cervical cancer and HPV (both funded by NIH). Our capacity to conduct these studies is derived from the utilization of unique prerequisites in Sweden, namely the extensive documentation present in computerized registers for population-based PAP-smear screening, potential ascertainment of all incident cases of adenocarcinoma, and access to archival smears and tissue specimens. Using a nested case-control design in this large study base, with up to 32 years of complete follow-up, 511 women with adenocarcinoma and 511 individually matched control women will be identified.      Using validated and sensitive PCR-assays, the presence of HPV DNA will be analyzed in all available smears from each participant (on an average four smears per individual, giving totally about 4,088 smears).HPV persistence, HPV16/18/45 viral load and HLA (types DQ6 and DR15) will be analyzed for all included women. Relative risks of cervical adenocarcinoma for oncogenic HPV infections, HPV persistence,HPV16/18/45 high viral load, HLA haplotype and interactions between these factors will be estimated with conditional logistic regression. The likelihood ratio test will be used to discriminate between nested models. Statistical power calculations produced for the specific aims show that our study is adequately sized.         n/a",Molecular epidemiology of cervical adenocarcinoma,6855636,R01CA111720,"['MHC class II antigen', 'Scandinavian', 'Scandinavian country', 'adenocarcinoma', 'cancer risk', 'cervical /vaginal smear', 'cervix neoplasms', 'clinical research', 'disease /disorder etiology', 'female', 'genetic registry /resource /referral center', 'genetic susceptibility', 'histopathology', 'human papillomavirus', 'human subject', 'human tissue', 'longitudinal human study', 'neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', 'technology /technique development', 'virus DNA', 'virus load', 'virus related neoplasm /cancer']",NCI,KAROLINSKA INSTITUTE,R01,2005,423791,1346985,0.020157042476522693
"Epidemiology of Stress and GDM among Latina Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes and obesity have reached epidemic proportions in the U.S. with rates consistently higher in Latinas than non-Latina whites. Shifting the prevention period for these conditions upstream, to pregnancy, may be an innovative strategy. The major aims of this proposal are to evaluate new and timely hypotheses regarding modifiable determinants of GDM among Latina women. We propose to evaluate the association between external stressors (physical activity), internal stressors (psychosocial stress), and mediators between these variables and risk of GDM.   Using a prospective cohort design, 2,300 Latina (predominantly Puerto Rican) prenatal care patients will be recruited from Baystate Medical Center at their first prenatal care visit (8-12 weeks gestation). Bilingual interviewers will obtain detailed information on physical activity patterns via the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ) (NIH/NICHD R03-39341) developed and validated for use in this population. Psychosocial stress will be assessed through 1) self-report (life events, perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and self-esteem) using scales validated in Latina populations, and 2) salivary cortisol, a physiologic marker of response to stress. Information on pregravid BMI, diet, cigarette smoking, substance abuse, medical and obstetric history, acculturation, and sociodemographic factors will also be queried. Weight and waist circumference will be measured. Two subsequent interviews, conducted at the time of routine ultrasound (18-20 weeks gestation) and GDM screen (24-28 weeks gestation), will update information on the variables of interest and repeat the salivary cortisol collection. A gestational-age stratified sample of 100 women from the cohort will be selected to assess diurnal variation in the cortisol measure. Lab reports will be abstracted for GDM screen results and a 4th interview will be conducted at 32-34 weeks gestation among those with elevated screening glucose. After delivery, medical records will be abstracted to confirm incident GDM and birth outcomes. Logistic regression will be used to assess the relationship between physical activity, psychosocial stress and GDM risk. Marginal structural models will assess the role of diet, body fat distribution, weight gain, and smoking as mediating variables in the relationship between stress and GDM. Cortisol will be analyzed in a nested case-control fashion on 116 GDM cases and a matched 4:1 sample of controls. A secondary analysis will prospectively assess the relationship between stress and adverse birth outcomes in among women with elevated screening glucose.  The proposed study builds upon our experience in the Latina GDM Study (American Diabetes Association Career Award) and extends the work of prior investigations through prospective assessment at multiple points in gestation, a multidimensional approach to stress measurement, and detailed evaluation of potential confounding and mediating factors in a large, high-risk population.

"Mammography Screening Decisions in the Elderly DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The benefits of mammography screening in women age 80 and older are uncertain. Guidelines encourage physicians to consider life expectancy before screening elderly women and to discuss the risks and benefits of screening with their elderly patients. Despite these recommendations, many elderly women are screened even those in poor health. It is unknown why so many elderly women are choosing to be screened and what factors influence this decision. To determine the accuracy of elderly women's knowledge about screening mammography and factors that influence screening decisions, the applicant proposes a two-phase study. Phase 1 uses qualitative methods to develop a survey about mammography screening decisions in the elderly and phase 2 involves administering the survey to a larger sample of women age 80 and older, using women ages 50-69 as a comparison group. Bivariable analyses and multivariable logistic regression will be performed to compare the accuracy of screening knowledge between elderly and younger patients as well as to determine age differences in the influence of several factors on the decision to be screened. This is the first study to explore very elderly women's approach to decisions about screening mammography. n/a",Mammography Screening Decisions in the Elderly,6834886,F32CA110424,"['age difference', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'clinical research', 'data collection', 'decision making', 'female', 'health surveys', 'human middle age (35-64)', 'human old age (65+)', 'human subject', 'interview', 'mammography', 'perception', 'postdoctoral investigator', 'preference', 'women&apos', 's health']",NCI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,F32,2004,52492,135941803,0.03365928810159464
"Allergic Condition Biomarkers and Glioma Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    An inverse association between self-reported allergic conditions (ACs) and glioma has been previously observed in seven case-control and two cohort studies. The mechanism for this association is not known, however, two cytokines that play a central role in ACs (i.e., interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13) also suppress glioma growth. From among genetic polymorphisms that are associated with risk of ACs, we have identified polymorphisms also involved in normal astrocyte growth or glioma pathogenesis. Gene products of genetic polymorphisms found on the IL-4, IL-13, IL-4Ralpha, IL-13Ralpha1, HLA -DRB1, RANTES, and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) play a role in both ACs and the brain. We will examine the case-control distribution of these polymorphisms and haplotypes to: 1) test the hypothesis that polymorphisms associated with ACs reduce glioma risk; 2) identify differential misclassification of serf-reported ACs (unequal measurement of cases and controls); 3) find out whether antihistamine use interferes with protection against glioma afforded by ACs; and 4) determine whether AC polymorphisms affect glioma risk independently of their association with ACs. The innovation in the proposed study is to focus on polymorphisms associated with ACs, an epidemiologic risk factor that reduces glioma risk, rather than on polymorphisms associated with carcinogenesis as has been done in previous studies.      Our pilot study will make use of interviews with 260 glioma cases and 450 controls that have already been conducted and blood samples that have been collected in conjunction a population-based case-control study of mobile telephone use and brain tumors in Sweden. Study participants were asked whether they have been diagnosed with asthma, eczema, hay fever or other allergies, continue to have allergies, have symptoms of allergies without a diagnosis, and have used allergy medication. Twenty ml of blood from each participant was collected and stored in a -80 degree freezer and DNA preparation is ongoing. Each participant will be evaluated for the presence AC polymorphisms. Unconditional logistic regression will be used to estimate the association between AC polymorphisms and glioma risk. Assuming a 0.05 significance level and 80 percent power, depending on the polymorphism, the proposed sample is large enough to detect a confounding-adjusted odds ratios of 0.6. n/a",Allergic Condition Biomarkers and Glioma Risk,6796148,R03CA103379,"['MHC class II antigen', 'antihistamines', 'biomarker', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis inhibitor', 'chemokine', 'clinical research', 'cytokine receptors', 'genetic polymorphism', 'glioma', 'human data', 'human genetic material tag', 'human tissue', 'hypersensitivity', 'interleukin 13', 'interleukin 4', 'neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', 'neoplasm /cancer genetics', 'neoplasm /cancer immunology', 'nitric oxide synthase']",NCI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2004,68103,241268189,-0.01441703255390561
"Promoting Breast Cancer Screening Via Computer V Phone DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the percentage of US women who have had at least one mammogram is rising, there is still a cadre of women who have never been screened, and adherence for routine repeat screening that will decrease mortality is poor. We need to identify mammography interventions that are effective for facilitating routine repeat screening, acceptable to women, and cost-effective for health care providers, managed-care organizations and insurers. In previous research, mammography-promotion interventions delivered via computer programs and telephone counseling have each led to increases in screening but, to date, neither their behavioral outcomes nor their cost effectiveness has been evaluated in direct comparison with each other.  This study will compare outcomes from a mammography intervention delivered by computer (CD-ROM) versus telephone. Approximately 1,686 women who are age-eligible for mammography, enrolled in a managed care organization or a large insurance plan, and have not had a mammogram within the previous 15 months will be enrolled in the study. Women will be randomly assigned to receive: (1) a mammography promotion intervention delivered via interactive computer program; (2) the intervention delivered via telephone; or (3) usual care. Computer and telephone interventions will be tailored to recipients' perceptions of susceptibility, benefits and barriers associated with mammography, and perceived self-efficacy for obtaining a mammogram. Women in the computer and telephone groups will receive ""booster"" interventions 12 months after their first intervention.  We will conduct process and outcome evaluations. Outcomes will include mammography adherence and stage of mammography adoption and intervention cost-effectiveness. A logistic regression model will be used to compare the binary outcome of mammography screening adherence by the primary predictor of intervention group, with age, race, and site and their interactions used as covariates. Stage of mammography adoption will be tested using logistic regression with ordinal outcome.

"Secondary Analysis of NC-BCSP Mammography Use Evaluation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The North Carolina Breast Cancer Screening Program (NC-BCSP) has conducted a ten-year effectiveness trial of a natural helper lay health advisor intervention in 10 counties (5 interventions, 5 comparisons) in eastern North Carolina to increase mammography use by low-income, rural, African American women. Three waves (baseline and 2 follow-ups) of interview data collected from a stratified random sample of, initially, 1000 Black women (500 intervention, 500 comparison) indicate that NC-BCSP's lay health advisor intervention was modestly effective overall after 30 months (at first follow-up IT2] in 1997), and associated with a greater increase in recent mammography use among specific subgroups, particularly women with annual family incomes under $12,000.  The proposed exploratory study uses all three waves of cohort data to determine: 1) whether NC-BCSP's intervention effect was sustained over the full 8 years of the evaluation (T1-T3), and for which subgroups; 2) what factors are associated with, and what pathways mediated, the intervention's effect initially (T1 - T2,) and in the second follow-up period (T2-T3); 3) how successfully an existing administrative data set (Medicare) can be used, instead of self-report data, to evaluate intervention effectiveness; and 4) whether geographical proximity, as measured by GIS software, of lay advisors to cohort respondents can serve as a useful proxy for self-report measures of exposure to the lay advisors. Analyses will use multivariate models with logistic regression and generalized estimating equations to account for repeated mammography reports.  The proposed secondary analyses of this unique longitudinal data set will provide valuable insights for designing more effective, better targeted, and more cost-effective interventions to reach the hardest-to-reach rural women still not being screened regularly. The goal of this grant is to understand the differences between continuous users, backsliders, late adopters and non-users of screening mammography, and the mechanisms, which explain variation in these groups' exposure to the intervention and their use, or non-use, of mammography. n/a",Secondary Analysis of NC-BCSP Mammography Use Evaluation,6707741,R21CA098934,"['African American', 'Medicare /Medicaid', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'breast neoplasms', 'clinical research', 'early diagnosis', 'female', 'geographic difference', 'health behavior', 'health care referral /consultation', 'health care service availability', 'health care service evaluation', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'health services research tag', 'human data', 'human old age (65+)', 'longitudinal human study', 'low socioeconomic status', 'mammography', 'medically underserved population', 'physicians', 'rural area', 'social support network']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2004,131400,0,0.019957150030871427
"Bacterial Vaginosis and Spontaneous Abortion   DESCRIPTION: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is extremely prevalent among low-income,       urban pregnant women. The current standard of medical care does not involve          screening pregnant women for BV unless clinical symptoms are reported; however,      the majority of pregnant women with BV are asymptomatic. A number of studies         have found associations between BV and late pregnancy outcomes; such as,             preterm labor, premature rupture of membrane, chorioamnionitis, and low birth        weight. The impact of BV on the risk for spontaneous abortion (SAB) is unclear.      In the proposed prospective cohort study, all women will be screened for BV          early in pregnancy regardless of symptoms. The specific aims of this study are       to: 1) characterize the prevalence and predictors of BV in women early in            pregnancy and 2) evaluate whether BV during pregnancy is an important,               independent predictor of SAB. Women attending their first clinical prenatal          care visit at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania Obstetric Clinic        with a pregnancy of 12 weeks gestation or less as determined by last menstrual       period will be recruited. We will screen all women for bacterial vaginosis and       follow-up through 22 weeks gestation to identify women experiencing a                spontaneous abortion. We will enroll 2200 women over a three year period arid        compare SAB rates for the estimated 400 women found to test positive for BY (20      percent of patients) and the 1600 women found to test negative for By. Baseline      data collection will be standardized and include a structured in-person              interview, a vaginal smear used to detect By, and urine analysis to determine        alcohol, cocaine and cotinine. Follow-up telephone interviews will be conducted      at 22 weeks gestation to determine the status of pregnancy (SAB vs. non-SAB)         and BV diagnosis and treatment. Pregnancy outcome status will also be                ascertained through ongoing review of medical records, pathology logs and birth      certificates. Initial analyses will be exploratory and descriptive,                  characterizing the prevalence and predictors of BV and the risk factors for          SAB. The primary analysis will be logistic regression, with relative risks and       95 percent confidence intervals, to explore whether BV is an independent             predictor of SAB.

"Bacterial Vaginosis and Spontaneous Abortion   DESCRIPTION: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is extremely prevalent among low-income,       urban pregnant women. The current standard of medical care does not involve          screening pregnant women for BV unless clinical symptoms are reported; however,      the majority of pregnant women with BV are asymptomatic. A number of studies         have found associations between BV and late pregnancy outcomes; such as,             preterm labor, premature rupture of membrane, chorioamnionitis, and low birth        weight. The impact of BV on the risk for spontaneous abortion (SAB) is unclear.      In the proposed prospective cohort study, all women will be screened for BV          early in pregnancy regardless of symptoms. The specific aims of this study are       to: 1) characterize the prevalence and predictors of BV in women early in            pregnancy and 2) evaluate whether BV during pregnancy is an important,               independent predictor of SAB.

"Regular Exercise Among Women at Risk for Preeclampsia   DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract): Preeclampsia, the sudden onset of high           blood pressure along with proteinuria during pregnancy, is a serious                 complication affecting nearly one in every 20 pregnancies. It is the main cause      of maternal death worldwide, and affects women of all races and socioeconomic        groups. Unfortunately, no definitive preventive treatment is currently               available for this ominous disease. Scientists now believe that preeclampsia is      a disease of the endothelium, due in part to oxidative stress. As such, regular      exercise has emerged as a potential preventive measure. This contrasts to daily      low dose aspirin or calcium supplement which have failed to demonstrate a            significant effect and may have adverse effects. The purpose of this study is        to determine if moderate intensity exercise during pregnancy will reduce the         incidence of preeclampsia and to assess the process (involving oxidative stress      and antioxidant process) hypothesized to explain the effect of exercise on           preeclampsia. This is a randomized clinical trial with a total of 250 pregnant       subjects at risk for preeclampsia. Eligible subjects will enter a run-in period      (i.e., qualifying period) at 14 to 18 weeks gestation. Baseline data to be           obtained include demographic information, health history, daily physical             activities, cardiovascular fitness level, blood pressure, blood sample for           serum iron, transferrin, low density lipoprotein, malondialdehyde, superoxide        dismutase. At 18 weeks, compliant subjects will be randomly assigned to either       the exercise (40 min., 70 percent VO2max, 5x/week) or sham exercise (control         group; 10 min. stretch exercise, 5x/week) condition. For both groups, all            baseline measurements will be repeated at 28 weeks (Outcome I). Subjects will        continue the exercise regimen after 28 weeks up to her term and as long as it        is safe and comfortable. A blood sample will be collected again during labor         (Outcome II). Subjects who undergo cesarean section for obstetrical reasons          will provide a small amount of subcutaneous tissue at the time of incision to        measure endothelial superoxide dismutase. Medical records will be reviewed for       additional outcome data (pregnancy/birth outcomes and diagnosis of                   preeclampsia). Chi-square tests of association and logistic regression analysis      will be applied to address the effect of exercise, prediction of preeclampsia,       and other pregnancy outcomes. Repeated Measures ANOVA will be applied to assess      the effect of exercise on various biological markers.

"Periodontal Disease and Prematurity    DESCRIPTION: Babies who are born prematurely and/or are underweight at birth are 20-80 times more likely to die before their first birthday. A significant proportion of preterm deliveries occur in women who are free of known risk factors. Periodontal disease is emerging as a potential risk factor although the results from human studies are equivocal. The long-term objective of this research is to further evaluate the extent to which the infections of periodontal origin play a role in preterm delivery. The primary Specific Aims of this project are 1) to measure the association between periodontal pathogens in cervical and vaginal samples of pregnant women and preterm birth, and 2) to measure the association between prenatal maternal serum IgG levels against specific periodontal pathogens and preterm birth. These Aims will be accomplished by conducting a nested case-control study within a large ongoing cohort study at the New York University Medical School (March-of-Dimes Study). Frozen serum and cervico-vaginal samples, data on biochemical markers such as IL-6, IL-8, TNFalpha, and Thrombin-antithrombin complexes, and validated questionnaire data on quality-of-life are available from this study. As of October 1,2003, there were 1579 subjects enrolled in this study and 1054 have already delivered (7% preterm deliveries and 10% low birth weight). Sixty-nine percent were Hispanic and 85% were 19-34 years of age. This study has two more years of enrollment remaining with an estimated 215 new recruits per year. Accordingly, we estimate that by October 2005 there will likely be 140 preterm and 1869 full term deliveries. Three pair-matched controls for each preterm delivery case will be selected from the full-term delivery subjects based on age, race, and date of delivery. Periodontal pathogens will be measured in cervico-vaginal samples using a checkerboard assay, and periodontal pathogen-specific IgG levels will be measured in serum samples using ELISA. Conditional logistic regression analysis will be used in the data analysis. As a secondary Aim, on an exploratory basis, levels of periodontal pathogens in oral, cervical, and vaginal samples, and periodontal pathogen specific serum IgG levels will be correlated with each other and also with preterm birth using fresh samples collected from the subjects that will be recruited to the March-of-Dimes Study after this application is funded (October 04-Oct 05; N=215). The proposed research is important because it will help identify the nature and the strength of the association between preterm delivery and periodontal disease-related factors which are modifiable in comparison to a majority of obstetrical risk factors that are not as easily changed. These associations have potential application in the early diagnosis and prevention of preterm deliveries. A major strength of the study is the efficacy gained by utilizing existing data and samples from a large cohort study. The collective expertise of the investigative team and the excellent clinical and research facilities are additional strengths.      n/a",Periodontal Disease and Prematurity,6826654,R01DE015594,"['bacterial disease', 'clinical research', 'comorbidity', 'enzyme linked immunosorbent assay', 'female', 'human subject', 'immunoglobulin G', 'periodontium disorder', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'pregnancy infection', 'premature labor', 'women&apos', 's health']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2004,308691,77336088,0.038215457915277466
"Allergic Condition Biomarkers and Glioma Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    An inverse association between self-reported allergic conditions (ACs) and glioma has been previously observed in seven case-control and two cohort studies. The mechanism for this association is not known, however, two cytokines that play a central role in ACs (i.e., interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13) also suppress glioma growth. From among genetic polymorphisms that are associated with risk of ACs, we have identified polymorphisms also involved in normal astrocyte growth or glioma pathogenesis. Gene products of genetic polymorphisms found on the IL-4, IL-13, IL-4Ralpha, IL-13Ralpha1, HLA -DRB1, RANTES, and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) play a role in both ACs and the brain. We will examine the case-control distribution of these polymorphisms and haplotypes to: 1) test the hypothesis that polymorphisms associated with ACs reduce glioma risk; 2) identify differential misclassification of serf-reported ACs (unequal measurement of cases and controls); 3) find out whether antihistamine use interferes with protection against glioma afforded by ACs; and 4) determine whether AC polymorphisms affect glioma risk independently of their association with ACs. The innovation in the proposed study is to focus on polymorphisms associated with ACs, an epidemiologic risk factor that reduces glioma risk, rather than on polymorphisms associated with carcinogenesis as has been done in previous studies.      Our pilot study will make use of interviews with 260 glioma cases and 450 controls that have already been conducted and blood samples that have been collected in conjunction a population-based case-control study of mobile telephone use and brain tumors in Sweden. Study participants were asked whether they have been diagnosed with asthma, eczema, hay fever or other allergies, continue to have allergies, have symptoms of allergies without a diagnosis, and have used allergy medication. Twenty ml of blood from each participant was collected and stored in a -80 degree freezer and DNA preparation is ongoing. Each participant will be evaluated for the presence AC polymorphisms. Unconditional logistic regression will be used to estimate the association between AC polymorphisms and glioma risk. Assuming a 0.05 significance level and 80 percent power, depending on the polymorphism, the proposed sample is large enough to detect a confounding-adjusted odds ratios of 0.6. n/a",Allergic Condition Biomarkers and Glioma Risk,6694204,R03CA103379,"['MHC class II antigen', ' antihistamines', ' biomarker', ' cancer risk', ' carcinogenesis inhibitor', ' chemokine', ' clinical research', ' cytokine receptors', ' genetic polymorphism', ' glioma', ' human data', ' human genetic material tag', ' human tissue', ' hypersensitivity', ' interleukin 13', ' interleukin 4', ' neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics', ' neoplasm /cancer immunology', ' nitric oxide synthase']",NCI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2003,73750,241268189,-0.01441703255390561
"COMMUNITY INTERVENTION TO INCREASE MAMMOGRAPHY SCREENING Low-income African American women are at relatively high risk for breast cancer mortality, due in part to their limited mammography use.  The purpose of the proposed stud is to compare the effect of a tailored interactive computer program with a culturally appropriate video on mammography use.  Secondly, this study will assess the effect of a booster tailored interactive computer programed and booster video program that is delivered one year after the initial intervention to improve interval mammography screening.  Finally, the cost effectiveness of both delivery methods will be explored. The design for this study contrasts three groups randomly allocated to tailored interactive computer, video, or control.  Subjects will include 625 African American women ages 41 to 75 years and at 150% poverty or below who have not had a mammogram in the last 18 months. A network of multi service centers located in the poorest areas of a large metropolitan are will serve as resources for recruitment and intervention delivery.  The interactive computer and video programs will build on concepts found to be predictive of mammography in prior work.  The intervention will be delivered to appropriate groups after a baseline interview and again at 12 months for women who are randomly assigned to receive a booster intervention. Only have of the women initially assigned to receive the interactive computer program or video will receive the booster in order to compare the women receiving the booster intervention with women who receive only the initial intervention.  Baseline interviews prior to intervention) will take place in the multi service center and telephone interviews will take place a three times following intervention delivery. l. Women will receive $25.00 following each interview, for a total of $100. This study is developed to have 90% power to detect overall differences in compliance at six months and 21 months.

"GESTATIONAL DIABETES:  DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND OUTCOMES   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from Investigator's Abstract) Gestational diabetes             mellitus (GDM) is associated with increased risk of several adverse infant and       maternal outcomes and its clinical recognition can reduce these risks. There is      concern that the current criteria for GDM may be to restrictive and that             residual excess risk of perinatal complications exists below present cutoff          values. The proposed study will evaluate whether among women without GDM (as         defined by current criteria), increasing levels of maternal glycemia are             associated with increased risk of selected perinatal complications: infant           severe macrosomia, severe hyperbilirubinemia, hypoglycemia, respiratory              distress syndrome, and maternal preeclampsia/eclampsia. To accomplish this, the      investigators propose to conduct five nested case-control studies, one for each      of the complications of interest, within a large multiethnic cohort of               approximately 74,000 women who were screened at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation at       Kaiser Permanente, Northern California between 1995 and 1998. In this setting        nearly 94 percent of the pregnant women are screened for GDM by a 50 gm., 1 hr.      oral glucose tolerance test (50 g, 1-h OGTT) and approximately 15 percent have       are abnormal screening and go on to receive the diagnostic (100-g, 3-h OGTT)         test. Potential cases of each type of complication will be identified by             searching computerized hospitalization and laboratory databases. For each of         the infant complications, 500 cases will be randomly selected without knowledge      of the maternal glucose values. A single control group for the infant                complication case groups will be 1,000 infants randomly selected from all            births and frequency matched on gestational age to the distribution of the           combined case group. Five hundred women with either preeclampsia or eclampsia        and 500 age-matched controls will be randomly selected. The medical records of       the 3,000 mother-infant pairs in the four case-control studies on infant             complications, and 1,000 women for the case-control study of                         preeclampsia/eclampsia, will be abstracted to confirm eligibility, and, if so,       to ascertain data on possible maternal and infant covariates. Logistic               regression will be used to estimate the odds ratios associated with several          levels of pregnancy glycemia and perinatal complications. The investigators          state that the proposed study will provide important knowledge about the             magnitude of the risk of severe perinatal complications associated with degrees      of maternal hyperglycemia below the glucose cutpoints currently used to              diagnose GDM.                                                                                                                                                             n/a",GESTATIONAL DIABETES:  DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND OUTCOMES,6650183,R01DK054834,"['blood glucose', ' clinical research', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' diagnostic tests', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' embryo /fetus disorder', ' epidemiology', ' female', ' gestational diabetes mellitus', ' human pregnant subject', ' human subject', ' mother /infant health care', ' outcomes research', ' preeclampsia']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2003,368323,111231681,0.07922302271156088
"AUTOMATED TELE COUNSELING FOR SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY   DESCRIPTION (adapted from investigator's abstract): The goal of this project is      to evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of a computer-based                  telecommunications system for increasing of regular screening mammography among      women ages 50-74. The Telephone-Linked-Communications for Mammography Screening      (TLC-M) is designed to educate, advise and motivate women to have regular            screening mammograms. There will be two versions of the TLC-M: one for women         who are coming due for their annual screening mammogram (""pre-due"" women) and a      second version for women who missed their annual mammogram and who are               ""past-due"" (""past-due"" women). The TLC technology supporting TLC-M has been          successfully used to positively affect patient behavior in medication                compliance, diet and exercise. It uses real human voice to speak over the            telephone; the users communicate by using the touch tone keypad on their             telephones.

In the proposed project, the investigators will (1) modify a current version of      TLC-M, (2) pretest and modify the system accordingly, and (3) conduct two            linked randomized controlled trials of the effectiveness of TLC-M in increasing      mammography rates in ""pre-due"" and ""past-due"" women. Eligible women will be          ages 50-74 and will have received a screening mammogram six months prior to          entering the study. The researchers will recruit 1,050 participants over 12          months from a general medical practice, using the computer system of an              affiliated radiology department to screen for potentially eligible women,            followed by a telephone and office interviews to determine final eligibility         and to collect baseline data. One month prior to their due date for annual           screening mammography, these women will receive a reminder letter to schedule a      mammogram. In addition, a random sample of 150 of them will use TLC-M. All           participants in this 'pre-due"" intervention will be evaluated 4 months after         their intervention to determine whether they obtained a mammogram.

"Bacterial Vaginosis and Spontaneous Abortion   DESCRIPTION: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is extremely prevalent among low-income,       urban pregnant women. The current standard of medical care does not involve          screening pregnant women for BV unless clinical symptoms are reported; however,      the majority of pregnant women with BV are asymptomatic. A number of studies         have found associations between BV and late pregnancy outcomes; such as,             preterm labor, premature rupture of membrane, chorioamnionitis, and low birth        weight. The impact of BV on the risk for spontaneous abortion (SAB) is unclear.      In the proposed prospective cohort study, all women will be screened for BV          early in pregnancy regardless of symptoms. The specific aims of this study are       to: 1) characterize the prevalence and predictors of BV in women early in            pregnancy and 2) evaluate whether BV during pregnancy is an important,               independent predictor of SAB. Women attending their first clinical prenatal          care visit at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania Obstetric Clinic        with a pregnancy of 12 weeks gestation or less as determined by last menstrual       period will be recruited. We will screen all women for bacterial vaginosis and       follow-up through 22 weeks gestation to identify women experiencing a                spontaneous abortion. We will enroll 2200 women over a three year period arid        compare SAB rates for the estimated 400 women found to test positive for BY (20      percent of patients) and the 1600 women found to test negative for By. Baseline      data collection will be standardized and include a structured in-person              interview, a vaginal smear used to detect By, and urine analysis to determine        alcohol, cocaine and cotinine. Follow-up telephone interviews will be conducted      at 22 weeks gestation to determine the status of pregnancy (SAB vs. non-SAB)         and BV diagnosis and treatment. Pregnancy outcome status will also be                ascertained through ongoing review of medical records, pathology logs and birth      certificates. Initial analyses will be exploratory and descriptive,                  characterizing the prevalence and predictors of BV and the risk factors for          SAB. The primary analysis will be logistic regression, with relative risks and       95 percent confidence intervals, to explore whether BV is an independent             predictor of SAB. This study will provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the       prevalence of BV among pregnant women and to determine the relationship between      BV and incident SAB.                                                                                                                                                      n/a",Bacterial Vaginosis and Spontaneous Abortion,6637934,R01HD038856,"['African American', ' bacterial disease', ' caucasian American', ' cervical /vaginal smear', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' drug detection', ' gestational age', ' human pregnant subject', ' interview', ' mass screening', ' patient oriented research', ' pregnancy', ' spontaneous abortion', ' statistics /biometry', ' telecommunications', ' urinalysis', ' vaginitis', "" women's health""]",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2003,611480,593605914,0.12287178253204371

"Regular Exercise Among Women at Risk for Preeclampsia   DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract): Preeclampsia, the sudden onset of high           blood pressure along with proteinuria during pregnancy, is a serious                 complication affecting nearly one in every 20 pregnancies. It is the main cause      of maternal death worldwide, and affects women of all races and socioeconomic        groups. Unfortunately, no definitive preventive treatment is currently               available for this ominous disease. Scientists now believe that preeclampsia is      a disease of the endothelium, due in part to oxidative stress. As such, regular      exercise has emerged as a potential preventive measure. This contrasts to daily      low dose aspirin or calcium supplement which have failed to demonstrate a            significant effect and may have adverse effects. The purpose of this study is        to determine if moderate intensity exercise during pregnancy will reduce the         incidence of preeclampsia and to assess the process (involving oxidative stress      and antioxidant process) hypothesized to explain the effect of exercise on           preeclampsia. This is a randomized clinical trial with a total of 250 pregnant       subjects at risk for preeclampsia. Eligible subjects will enter a run-in period      (i.e., qualifying period) at 14 to 18 weeks gestation. Baseline data to be           obtained include demographic information, health history, daily physical             activities, cardiovascular fitness level, blood pressure, blood sample for           serum iron, transferrin, low density lipoprotein, malondialdehyde, superoxide        dismutase. At 18 weeks, compliant subjects will be randomly assigned to either       the exercise (40 min., 70 percent VO2max, 5x/week) or sham exercise (control         group; 10 min. stretch exercise, 5x/week) condition. For both groups, all            baseline measurements will be repeated at 28 weeks (Outcome I). Subjects will        continue the exercise regimen after 28 weeks up to her term and as long as it        is safe and comfortable. A blood sample will be collected again during labor         (Outcome II). Subjects who undergo cesarean section for obstetrical reasons          will provide a small amount of subcutaneous tissue at the time of incision to        measure endothelial superoxide dismutase. Medical records will be reviewed for       additional outcome data (pregnancy/birth outcomes and diagnosis of                   preeclampsia). Chi-square tests of association and logistic regression analysis      will be applied to address the effect of exercise, prediction of preeclampsia,       and other pregnancy outcomes. Repeated Measures ANOVA will be applied to assess      the effect of exercise on various biological markers.

"GESTATIONAL DIABETES:  DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND OUTCOMES   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from Investigator's Abstract) Gestational diabetes             mellitus (GDM) is associated with increased risk of several adverse infant and       maternal outcomes and its clinical recognition can reduce these risks. There is      concern that the current criteria for GDM may be to restrictive and that             residual excess risk of perinatal complications exists below present cutoff          values. The proposed study will evaluate whether among women without GDM (as         defined by current criteria), increasing levels of maternal glycemia are             associated with increased risk of selected perinatal complications: infant           severe macrosomia, severe hyperbilirubinemia, hypoglycemia, respiratory              distress syndrome, and maternal preeclampsia/eclampsia. To accomplish this, the      investigators propose to conduct five nested case-control studies, one for each      of the complications of interest, within a large multiethnic cohort of               approximately 74,000 women who were screened at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation at       Kaiser Permanente, Northern California between 1995 and 1998. In this setting        nearly 94 percent of the pregnant women are screened for GDM by a 50 gm., 1 hr.      oral glucose tolerance test (50 g, 1-h OGTT) and approximately 15 percent have       are abnormal screening and go on to receive the diagnostic (100-g, 3-h OGTT)         test. Potential cases of each type of complication will be identified by             searching computerized hospitalization and laboratory databases. For each of         the infant complications, 500 cases will be randomly selected without knowledge      of the maternal glucose values. A single control group for the infant                complication case groups will be 1,000 infants randomly selected from all            births and frequency matched on gestational age to the distribution of the           combined case group. Five hundred women with either preeclampsia or eclampsia        and 500 age-matched controls will be randomly selected. The medical records of       the 3,000 mother-infant pairs in the four case-control studies on infant             complications, and 1,000 women for the case-control study of                         preeclampsia/eclampsia, will be abstracted to confirm eligibility, and, if so,       to ascertain data on possible maternal and infant covariates. Logistic               regression will be used to estimate the odds ratios associated with several          levels of pregnancy glycemia and perinatal complications. The investigators          state that the proposed study will provide important knowledge about the             magnitude of the risk of severe perinatal complications associated with degrees      of maternal hyperglycemia below the glucose cutpoints currently used to              diagnose GDM.                                                                                                                                                             n/a",GESTATIONAL DIABETES:  DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND OUTCOMES,6523755,R01DK054834,"['blood glucose', ' clinical research', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' diagnostic tests', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' embryo /fetus disorder', ' epidemiology', ' female', ' gestational diabetes mellitus', ' human pregnant subject', ' human subject', ' mother /infant health care', ' outcomes research', ' preeclampsia']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2002,395840,111231681,0.07922302271156088
"AUTOMATED TELE COUNSELING FOR SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY   DESCRIPTION (adapted from investigator's abstract): The goal of this project is      to evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of a computer-based                  telecommunications system for increasing of regular screening mammography among      women ages 50-74. The Telephone-Linked-Communications for Mammography Screening      (TLC-M) is designed to educate, advise and motivate women to have regular            screening mammograms. There will be two versions of the TLC-M: one for women         who are coming due for their annual screening mammogram (""pre-due"" women) and a      second version for women who missed their annual mammogram and who are               ""past-due"" (""past-due"" women). The TLC technology supporting TLC-M has been          successfully used to positively affect patient behavior in medication                compliance, diet and exercise. It uses real human voice to speak over the            telephone; the users communicate by using the touch tone keypad on their             telephones. TLC-M will consist of up to three automated telephone                    conversations.

"STD PREVENTION FOR AT RISK AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN The purpose of the study is to test the effectiveness of a 12-month multi-modal Well Woman intervention to prevent new sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among young, low-income African American women with a history of repeated STDs.  The target group lives on or near the Chicago Westside, where women are plagued with some of the highest STD rates in the nation. The Specific Aim is to determine the effects of the randomized, controlled repeated measures trial on (a) the mediating outcomes--STD related social, psychological, and skill/behavioral factors, and (b) the health status outcome-laboratory-confirmed newly contracted STDs.  The intervention is case-managed by advanced practice nurses (APNs) and complemented by a social worker and peer educators.  The intervention has a 2 month intensive phase and a 10-month maintenance phase with evidence- based standardized and individualized STD-prevention strategies: STD diagnosis, treatment, teaching, and support by APNs; STD prevention classes led by peer educators; community referrals and retention strategies by a social worker; and partner classes, counseling, and referrals.  Subjects will be 670 women aged 18-29 years who have an index STD and at least 1 other STD in their histories.  Subject recruitment will occur at 4 publicly supported West Side clinics, and the intervention will be in the West Side Health Center, a new Cook County Health Services facility in the center of the area.  After baseline measures, the women will be randomly assigned to control or intervention groups with the minimization subject distribution procedure, taking into account the history of intravenous drug use, number of sexual partners, sexual violence, and HIV seropositivity.  The control group will have usual care, STD urine screening, HIV testing (offered) and a minimal didactic experience until the 12-month measure is taken.  Then they will be offered a concentrated intervention.  A STD-Prevention Framework derived from a tested nursing model, Cox's Interaction Model of Client Health Behavior, will guide the overall intervention and the components.  Analyses include change scores, logistic regression, proportional odds regression and random regression analysis.  n/a",STD PREVENTION FOR AT RISK AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN,6539375,R01NR004836,"['AIDS /HIV test', ' African American', ' HIV infections', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' clinical research', ' communicable disease control', ' counseling', ' female', ' health behavior', ' human subject', ' human therapy evaluation', ' low socioeconomic status', ' nursing intervention', ' sex behavior', ' sexually transmitted diseases', ' substance abuse related behavior', "" women's health"", ' young adult human (21-34)']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2002,467931,148463823,-0.009659391093875137
"Bacterial Vaginosis and Spontaneous Abortion   DESCRIPTION: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is extremely prevalent among low-income,       urban pregnant women. The current standard of medical care does not involve          screening pregnant women for BV unless clinical symptoms are reported; however,      the majority of pregnant women with BV are asymptomatic. A number of studies         have found associations between BV and late pregnancy outcomes; such as,             preterm labor, premature rupture of membrane, chorioamnionitis, and low birth        weight. The impact of BV on the risk for spontaneous abortion (SAB) is unclear.      In the proposed prospective cohort study, all women will be screened for BV          early in pregnancy regardless of symptoms. The specific aims of this study are       to: 1) characterize the prevalence and predictors of BV in women early in            pregnancy and 2) evaluate whether BV during pregnancy is an important,               independent predictor of SAB. Women attending their first clinical prenatal          care visit at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania Obstetric Clinic        with a pregnancy of 12 weeks gestation or less as determined by last menstrual       period will be recruited. We will screen all women for bacterial vaginosis and       follow-up through 22 weeks gestation to identify women experiencing a                spontaneous abortion. We will enroll 2200 women over a three year period arid        compare SAB rates for the estimated 400 women found to test positive for BY (20      percent of patients) and the 1600 women found to test negative for By. Baseline      data collection will be standardized and include a structured in-person              interview, a vaginal smear used to detect By, and urine analysis to determine        alcohol, cocaine and cotinine. Follow-up telephone interviews will be conducted      at 22 weeks gestation to determine the status of pregnancy (SAB vs. non-SAB)         and BV diagnosis and treatment. Pregnancy outcome status will also be                ascertained through ongoing review of medical records, pathology logs and birth      certificates. Initial analyses will be exploratory and descriptive,                  characterizing the prevalence and predictors of BV and the risk factors for          SAB. The primary analysis will be logistic regression, with relative risks and       95 percent confidence intervals, to explore whether BV is an independent             predictor of SAB. This study will provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the       prevalence of BV among pregnant women and to determine the relationship between      BV and incident SAB.                                                                                                                                                      n/a",Bacterial Vaginosis and Spontaneous Abortion,6536122,R01HD038856,"['African American', ' bacterial disease', ' caucasian American', ' cervical /vaginal smear', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' drug detection', ' gestational age', ' human pregnant subject', ' interview', ' mass screening', ' patient oriented research', ' pregnancy', ' spontaneous abortion', ' statistics /biometry', ' telecommunications', ' urinalysis', ' vaginitis', "" women's health""]",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2002,611300,593605914,0.12287178253204371
"Latinas:  Impact of Citizenship on Access to Pap Smears Some studies have found Latina women to be a particularly vulnerable population as regards underutilization of preventive services (Anderson and May, 1995, Kirkman-Liff and Kronenfeld, 1992). Given the importance of preventive services, including cancer-screening services to reduce morbidity and mortality, it is important to identify predictors of this under-utilization of services. Barriers specific to immigrant women have been investigated including issues of acculturation, language, and country of origin. However, one factor that has not been explored is the impact of citizenship status. The Expanded Andersen Behavioral Model of Health Services Use is a highly regarded model for explaining health care services utilization. To date, citizenship status has not been included in this model. Citizenship may increase the predictive ability of this model and should be considered for inclusion. The purpose of this research is to test, through applied research, the appropriateness of including a citizenship variable in the Andersen paradigm. This research is designed to examine utilization of preventive services by Latina women living in Los Angeles County with the intent of determining whether citizenship plays a significant role in access, especially for the large Latina immigrant population. Access/ utilization will be measured by appropriate use of the specific cancer-screening test for cancer of the cervix, the Pap smear. A cross-sectional study design using a secondary data source will examine the impact of citizenship on a sample of 1784 Latina women, ages 18 years or older, living in Los Angeles County. The data are from the 1997 Los Angeles County Health Survey which is a population-based, random digit dialing telephone survey of 8,004 households in Los Angeles County. Logistic regression will be performed separately for each of the empirical models. Stepwise regression will facilitate variables being added (forced in) according to the expansion of the initial, simple model. This modeling methodology allows for analysis of changes in the results as the conceptual model is expanded to include additional predictors of Pap smear utilization. The final model will control for approximately 40+ separate factors derived from the Andersen Model that might impact on access/utilization of this preventive service.  n/a",Latinas:  Impact of Citizenship on Access to Pap Smears,6315032,R03HS011273,"['Hispanic Americans', ' United States', ' cervical /vaginal smear', ' clinical research', ' disease /disorder prevention /control', ' female', ' health care service utilization', ' health services research tag', ' human subject', ' immigrant', ' interview', ' named group']",AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R03,2001,32048,673201228,0.0001595770532103526

"PRENATAL MENTAL HEALTH OF POOR WOMEN--SERVICES AND COSTS The primary purpose of this study is to determine the impact of prenatal         psychiatric disorders on birth outcomes, health service utilization and          costs.  Infant mortality and morbidity rates in this country continue            to exceed those of most industrialized countries.  For low-income women,         particularly African Americans and those with limited access to health           services, infant mortality and morbidity rates approximate those of              third-world countries.  Although biological, genetic and psychosocial            factors are linked to poor birth outcomes, one factor that has been              overlooked is prenatal psychiatric disorders, despite compelling                 evidence associating mental health problems with maternal-infant health.         Even less is known about how our health service delivery system                  contributes to poor birth outcomes through inadequate detection and              treatment of prenatal psychiatric disorders.  A better understanding of          how psychiatric illness influences the prenatal and postpartum use of            health services and costs is also needed.  This study will use a                 prospective cohort research design to compare outcomes between low-              income pregnant women with and without psychiatric disorders who are             stratified by race and urban-rural residence.  Using the Composite               International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), the presence or absence of            current psychiatric disorders will first be determined in a sample of            1095 pregnant Medicaid recipients who receive services in Special                Supplemental Nutrition Programs for Women, Infants and Children (WIC).

"Regular Exercise Among Women at Risk for Preeclampsia   DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract): Preeclampsia, the sudden onset of high           blood pressure along with proteinuria during pregnancy, is a serious                 complication affecting nearly one in every 20 pregnancies. It is the main cause      of maternal death worldwide, and affects women of all races and socioeconomic        groups. Unfortunately, no definitive preventive treatment is currently               available for this ominous disease. Scientists now believe that preeclampsia is      a disease of the endothelium, due in part to oxidative stress. As such, regular      exercise has emerged as a potential preventive measure. This contrasts to daily      low dose aspirin or calcium supplement which have failed to demonstrate a            significant effect and may have adverse effects. The purpose of this study is        to determine if moderate intensity exercise during pregnancy will reduce the         incidence of preeclampsia and to assess the process (involving oxidative stress      and antioxidant process) hypothesized to explain the effect of exercise on           preeclampsia. This is a randomized clinical trial with a total of 250 pregnant       subjects at risk for preeclampsia. Eligible subjects will enter a run-in period      (i.e., qualifying period) at 14 to 18 weeks gestation. Baseline data to be           obtained include demographic information, health history, daily physical             activities, cardiovascular fitness level, blood pressure, blood sample for           serum iron, transferrin, low density lipoprotein, malondialdehyde, superoxide        dismutase. At 18 weeks, compliant subjects will be randomly assigned to either       the exercise (40 min., 70 percent VO2max, 5x/week) or sham exercise (control         group; 10 min. stretch exercise, 5x/week) condition. For both groups, all            baseline measurements will be repeated at 28 weeks (Outcome I). Subjects will        continue the exercise regimen after 28 weeks up to her term and as long as it        is safe and comfortable. A blood sample will be collected again during labor         (Outcome II). Subjects who undergo cesarean section for obstetrical reasons          will provide a small amount of subcutaneous tissue at the time of incision to        measure endothelial superoxide dismutase. Medical records will be reviewed for       additional outcome data (pregnancy/birth outcomes and diagnosis of                   preeclampsia). Chi-square tests of association and logistic regression analysis      will be applied to address the effect of exercise, prediction of preeclampsia,       and other pregnancy outcomes.

"GESTATIONAL DIABETES:  DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND OUTCOMES   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from Investigator's Abstract) Gestational diabetes             mellitus (GDM) is associated with increased risk of several adverse infant and       maternal outcomes and its clinical recognition can reduce these risks. There is      concern that the current criteria for GDM may be to restrictive and that             residual excess risk of perinatal complications exists below present cutoff          values. The proposed study will evaluate whether among women without GDM (as         defined by current criteria), increasing levels of maternal glycemia are             associated with increased risk of selected perinatal complications: infant           severe macrosomia, severe hyperbilirubinemia, hypoglycemia, respiratory              distress syndrome, and maternal preeclampsia/eclampsia. To accomplish this, the      investigators propose to conduct five nested case-control studies, one for each      of the complications of interest, within a large multiethnic cohort of               approximately 74,000 women who were screened at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation at       Kaiser Permanente, Northern California between 1995 and 1998. In this setting        nearly 94 percent of the pregnant women are screened for GDM by a 50 gm., 1 hr.      oral glucose tolerance test (50 g, 1-h OGTT) and approximately 15 percent have       are abnormal screening and go on to receive the diagnostic (100-g, 3-h OGTT)         test. Potential cases of each type of complication will be identified by             searching computerized hospitalization and laboratory databases. For each of         the infant complications, 500 cases will be randomly selected without knowledge      of the maternal glucose values. A single control group for the infant                complication case groups will be 1,000 infants randomly selected from all            births and frequency matched on gestational age to the distribution of the           combined case group. Five hundred women with either preeclampsia or eclampsia        and 500 age-matched controls will be randomly selected. The medical records of       the 3,000 mother-infant pairs in the four case-control studies on infant             complications, and 1,000 women for the case-control study of                         preeclampsia/eclampsia, will be abstracted to confirm eligibility, and, if so,       to ascertain data on possible maternal and infant covariates. Logistic               regression will be used to estimate the odds ratios associated with several          levels of pregnancy glycemia and perinatal complications. The investigators          state that the proposed study will provide important knowledge about the             magnitude of the risk of severe perinatal complications associated with degrees      of maternal hyperglycemia below the glucose cutpoints currently used to              diagnose GDM.                                                                                                                                                             n/a",GESTATIONAL DIABETES:  DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND OUTCOMES,6402593,R01DK054834,"['blood glucose', ' clinical research', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' diagnostic tests', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' embryo /fetus disorder', ' epidemiology', ' female', ' gestational diabetes mellitus', ' human pregnant subject', ' human subject', ' mother /infant health care', ' outcomes research', ' preeclampsia']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2001,384853,111231681,0.07922302271156088
"Bacterial Vaginosis and Spontaneous Abortion   DESCRIPTION: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is extremely prevalent among low-income,       urban pregnant women. The current standard of medical care does not involve          screening pregnant women for BV unless clinical symptoms are reported; however,      the majority of pregnant women with BV are asymptomatic. A number of studies         have found associations between BV and late pregnancy outcomes; such as,             preterm labor, premature rupture of membrane, chorioamnionitis, and low birth        weight. The impact of BV on the risk for spontaneous abortion (SAB) is unclear.      In the proposed prospective cohort study, all women will be screened for BV          early in pregnancy regardless of symptoms. The specific aims of this study are       to: 1) characterize the prevalence and predictors of BV in women early in            pregnancy and 2) evaluate whether BV during pregnancy is an important,               independent predictor of SAB. Women attending their first clinical prenatal          care visit at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania Obstetric Clinic        with a pregnancy of 12 weeks gestation or less as determined by last menstrual       period will be recruited. We will screen all women for bacterial vaginosis and       follow-up through 22 weeks gestation to identify women experiencing a                spontaneous abortion. We will enroll 2200 women over a three year period arid        compare SAB rates for the estimated 400 women found to test positive for BY (20      percent of patients) and the 1600 women found to test negative for By. Baseline      data collection will be standardized and include a structured in-person              interview, a vaginal smear used to detect By, and urine analysis to determine        alcohol, cocaine and cotinine. Follow-up telephone interviews will be conducted      at 22 weeks gestation to determine the status of pregnancy (SAB vs. non-SAB)         and BV diagnosis and treatment. Pregnancy outcome status will also be                ascertained through ongoing review of medical records, pathology logs and birth      certificates. Initial analyses will be exploratory and descriptive,                  characterizing the prevalence and predictors of BV and the risk factors for          SAB.

There will be two versions of the TLC-M: one for women         who are coming due for their annual screening mammogram (""pre-due"" women) and a      second version for women who missed their annual mammogram and who are               ""past-due"" (""past-due"" women). The TLC technology supporting TLC-M has been          successfully used to positively affect patient behavior in medication                compliance, diet and exercise. It uses real human voice to speak over the            telephone; the users communicate by using the touch tone keypad on their             telephones. TLC-M will consist of up to three automated telephone                    conversations. The content of these conversations is based on the                    Transtheoretical Model in which a women's readiness to obtain routine screening      mammograms is assessed. Depending upon the women's intention, barriers for           having mammography are identified and addressed.                                                                                                                          In the proposed project, the investigators will (1) modify a current version of      TLC-M, (2) pretest and modify the system accordingly, and (3) conduct two            linked randomized controlled trials of the effectiveness of TLC-M in increasing      mammography rates in ""pre-due"" and ""past-due"" women. Eligible women will be          ages 50-74 and will have received a screening mammogram six months prior to          entering the study. The researchers will recruit 1,050 participants over 12          months from a general medical practice, using the computer system of an              affiliated radiology department to screen for potentially eligible women,            followed by a telephone and office interviews to determine final eligibility         and to collect baseline data. One month prior to their due date for annual           screening mammography, these women will receive a reminder letter to schedule a      mammogram. In addition, a random sample of 150 of them will use TLC-M. All           participants in this 'pre-due"" intervention will be evaluated 4 months after         their intervention to determine whether they obtained a mammogram.

"DOMESTIC VIOLENCE--CHINESE WOMEN IN THE US AND IN CHINA Chinese families are particularly in a vulnerable position for domestic violence due to lack of awareness and cultural background.  Few studies have looked at the prevalence and outcomes of domestic violence among the Chinese population, in the US or in China.  The specific aims of the proposed study will focus on: 1) to develop a culturally appropriate instrument for assessing domestic violence against Chinese women in the US and in China; 2) to investigate, document and compare the type and prevalence of domestic violence in Chinese women in the US and in China; 3) to investigate and compare the risk factors for domestic violence in Chinese women in the US and in China; and 4) to examine and compare the mental and physical health outcomes associated with domestic violence in Chinese women in the US and China.  For preliminary instrument development, a total sample of 200 battered Chinese women and staff working with them will be obtained from 3 Asian Women's Shelters in the US and a Women's Federation in China.  A final random sample of 2000 Chinese women will be interviewed in New York Chinatown clinical settings and 4 major hospitals in Fuzhou, China for the abuse prevalence survey. Medical records will be reviewed on at least 120 battered women identified from the prevalence survey in both countries.  The interview instrument for domestic violence screening, which will screen for prior year abuse and lifetime history of abuse and types of abuse, will be designed and tested for reliability and validity prior to the dissertation.  Descriptive statistics and odds ratios will be used to compare types and prevalence of abuse, and multiple logistic regression will be used to determine the risk factors and associated medical conditions and symptoms for cases as compared to controls.  This proposed study will build on the Sponsor's prior and current research in the area with case control studies, and the applicant's preliminary prevalence violence study in China to investigate domestic violence in Chinese population in the US and in China.  n/a",DOMESTIC VIOLENCE--CHINESE WOMEN IN THE US AND IN CHINA,6187489,F31NR007446,"['China', ' Chinese', ' Chinese American', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' case history', ' clinical research', ' culture', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' epidemiology', ' female', ' health', ' human subject', ' interview', ' mental health', ' racial /ethnic difference', ' spouse abuse', ' statistics /biometry', ' violence']",NINR,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2000,28480,807432003,0.06448422409340218
"BIRTHWEIGHT AND GESTATIONAL AGE AND CHRONIC DISEASE RISK Several studies have shown that people born small or thin have increased risk for developing Insulin Resistance Syndrome (IRS), non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and cardiovascular disease (CVD) as adults.  These observations have led to the ""fetal origins"" hypothesis - that susceptibility to these chronic adult conditions may be programmed in utero.  The profound metabolic and hemodynamic changes that occur in gestation make pregnancy a physiologic stress test for glucose intolerance, hypertension, and other IRS-related abnormalities. Gestational diabetes (GDM) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) are two common complications of pregnancy that share many characteristics of IRS, and also predict a woman's risk for the later development of NIDDM and CVD.  We propose to investigate the effects of a woman's growth before her own birth (indicated by her own birthweight and gestational age) on her risk in young adulthood for PIH or GDM.  Apart from promising preliminary work we have recently completed in Colorado, this is an area of investigation that has not previously been explored.  The proposal is to conduct a case-control study based on birth registry and hospital discharge data from New York State and New York City, computer-linked across a generation.  Subjects will be women who were born in NY after 1959 and delivered a live singleton infant in New York between 1990 and 1996.  Cases will be subjects who had PIH and/or GDM diagnosed during a recent pregnancy (1990-1996), while controls will be subjects frequency matched to cases on hospital and year of delivery, but without a diagnosis of PIH or GDM.  The records of each subject's recent pregnancy (1990-1996) will be matched to those of her own birth (12-36 years earlier).  We will use multiple logistic regression to estimate the independent effects of a mother's own early growth, as indicated by birth weight and gestational age, on her later risk of developing GDM or PIH.  The analysis will account for potential confounding and effect-modifying factors, including race/ethnicity, maternal age, and smoking.  We will also conduct a sub-study of the validity of the diagnoses of GDM and PIH on the birth records.  This study will thus offer a powerful and cost-efficient way to investigate the hypothesis of the fetal origins of GDM and PIH, two common but still poorly understood complications of pregnancy which are associated with increased risk for chronic disease later in life.  n/a",BIRTHWEIGHT AND GESTATIONAL AGE AND CHRONIC DISEASE RISK,6177562,R03DK053608,"['age at pregnancy', ' chronic disease /disorder', ' clinical research', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' gestational age', ' gestational diabetes mellitus', ' human birth weight', ' human data', ' longitudinal human study', ' pregnancy toxemia /hypertension', ' racial /ethnic difference', ' tobacco abuse']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R03,2000,75443,292134808,0.0759963843304744
"PRENATAL MENTAL HEALTH OF POOR WOMEN--SERVICES AND COSTS The primary purpose of this study is to determine the impact of prenatal         psychiatric disorders on birth outcomes, health service utilization and          costs.  Infant mortality and morbidity rates in this country continue            to exceed those of most industrialized countries.  For low-income women,         particularly African Americans and those with limited access to health           services, infant mortality and morbidity rates approximate those of              third-world countries.  Although biological, genetic and psychosocial            factors are linked to poor birth outcomes, one factor that has been              overlooked is prenatal psychiatric disorders, despite compelling                 evidence associating mental health problems with maternal-infant health.         Even less is known about how our health service delivery system                  contributes to poor birth outcomes through inadequate detection and              treatment of prenatal psychiatric disorders.  A better understanding of          how psychiatric illness influences the prenatal and postpartum use of            health services and costs is also needed.  This study will use a                 prospective cohort research design to compare outcomes between low-              income pregnant women with and without psychiatric disorders who are             stratified by race and urban-rural residence.  Using the Composite               International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), the presence or absence of            current psychiatric disorders will first be determined in a sample of            1095 pregnant Medicaid recipients who receive services in Special                Supplemental Nutrition Programs for Women, Infants and Children (WIC).           A sample of 219 pregnant women with current psychiatric diagnoses and            a comparison group of 211 pregnant women without psychiatric diagnoses           will be followed for three months postpartum to ascertain birth                  outcomes, use of health services and cost of these services.  Using              Birth certificate and Medicaid claims data, multiple or logistic                 regression will determine the independent effect of current psychiatric          disorders on birth outcomes and health service utilization rates,                controlling for other explanatory variables. Differences in cost                 estimates from diagnosis related cost weights and total charges will be          explained using multiple regression analysis.                                     n/a",PRENATAL MENTAL HEALTH OF POOR WOMEN--SERVICES AND COSTS,6126177,R01MH057736,"['Medicare /Medicaid', ' birth', ' clinical research', ' female', ' gestational age', ' health care cost /financing', ' health care service utilization', ' health services research tag', ' human birth weight', ' human pregnant subject', ' longitudinal human study', ' low socioeconomic status', ' mental disorder diagnosis', ' mental disorders', ' mental health epidemiology', ' outcomes research', ' pregnancy', ' prenatal care', ' spouse abuse', "" women's health""]",NIMH,SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY,R01,2000,311627,31510749,0.03466223182922771
"GESTATIONAL DIABETES:  DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND OUTCOMES   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from Investigator's Abstract) Gestational diabetes             mellitus (GDM) is associated with increased risk of several adverse infant and       maternal outcomes and its clinical recognition can reduce these risks. There is      concern that the current criteria for GDM may be to restrictive and that             residual excess risk of perinatal complications exists below present cutoff          values. The proposed study will evaluate whether among women without GDM (as         defined by current criteria), increasing levels of maternal glycemia are             associated with increased risk of selected perinatal complications: infant           severe macrosomia, severe hyperbilirubinemia, hypoglycemia, respiratory              distress syndrome, and maternal preeclampsia/eclampsia. To accomplish this, the      investigators propose to conduct five nested case-control studies, one for each      of the complications of interest, within a large multiethnic cohort of               approximately 74,000 women who were screened at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation at       Kaiser Permanente, Northern California between 1995 and 1998. In this setting        nearly 94 percent of the pregnant women are screened for GDM by a 50 gm., 1 hr.      oral glucose tolerance test (50 g, 1-h OGTT) and approximately 15 percent have       are abnormal screening and go on to receive the diagnostic (100-g, 3-h OGTT)         test. Potential cases of each type of complication will be identified by             searching computerized hospitalization and laboratory databases. For each of         the infant complications, 500 cases will be randomly selected without knowledge      of the maternal glucose values. A single control group for the infant                complication case groups will be 1,000 infants randomly selected from all            births and frequency matched on gestational age to the distribution of the           combined case group. Five hundred women with either preeclampsia or eclampsia        and 500 age-matched controls will be randomly selected. The medical records of       the 3,000 mother-infant pairs in the four case-control studies on infant             complications, and 1,000 women for the case-control study of                         preeclampsia/eclampsia, will be abstracted to confirm eligibility, and, if so,       to ascertain data on possible maternal and infant covariates. Logistic               regression will be used to estimate the odds ratios associated with several          levels of pregnancy glycemia and perinatal complications. The investigators          state that the proposed study will provide important knowledge about the             magnitude of the risk of severe perinatal complications associated with degrees      of maternal hyperglycemia below the glucose cutpoints currently used to              diagnose GDM.                                                                                                                                                             n/a",GESTATIONAL DIABETES:  DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND OUTCOMES,6131712,R01DK054834,"['blood glucose', ' clinical research', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' diagnostic tests', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' embryo /fetus disorder', ' epidemiology', ' female', ' gestational diabetes mellitus', ' human pregnant subject', ' human subject', ' mother /infant health care', ' outcomes research', ' preeclampsia']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2000,332039,111231681,0.07922302271156088
"COMMUNITY INTERVENTION TO INCREASE MAMMOGRAPHY SCREENING Low-income African American women are at relatively high risk for breast cancer mortality, due in part to their limited mammography use.  The purpose of the proposed stud is to compare the effect of a tailored interactive computer program with a culturally appropriate video on mammography use.  Secondly, this study will assess the effect of a booster tailored interactive computer programed and booster video program that is delivered one year after the initial intervention to improve interval mammography screening.  Finally, the cost effectiveness of both delivery methods will be explored. The design for this study contrasts three groups randomly allocated to tailored interactive computer, video, or control.  Subjects will include 625 African American women ages 41 to 75 years and at 150% poverty or below who have not had a mammogram in the last 18 months. A network of multi service centers located in the poorest areas of a large metropolitan are will serve as resources for recruitment and intervention delivery.  The interactive computer and video programs will build on concepts found to be predictive of mammography in prior work.  The intervention will be delivered to appropriate groups after a baseline interview and again at 12 months for women who are randomly assigned to receive a booster intervention. Only have of the women initially assigned to receive the interactive computer program or video will receive the booster in order to compare the women receiving the booster intervention with women who receive only the initial intervention.  Baseline interviews prior to intervention) will take place in the multi service center and telephone interviews will take place a three times following intervention delivery. l. Women will receive $25.00 following each interview, for a total of $100. This study is developed to have 90% power to detect overall differences in compliance at six months and 21 months.  Mammography compliance will be measured through self-report and facility verification.  Belief variables built into the intervention and measured through validity and reliability.
