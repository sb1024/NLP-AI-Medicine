"Diabetes, Medications and the Cost-Effectiveness of Screening for Colorectal Neoplasia Project Summary/Abstract: The candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator with transdisciplinary expertise in cancer epidemiology, biomedical informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and health economic modeling and evaluation. The focused didactic training, mentorship, and experiential learning through research activities proposed in this award will facilitate the development of critical skills in the pursuit of knowledge to inform and improve cancer prevention and screening. The candidate's research is motivated by the recognition that type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients are at a 30-40% increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC), and that anti-diabetic drugs may also alter CRC risk. Thus, this high-risk group presents an opportunity for targeted screening and early detection of CRC. Currently, CRC screening is based on age and family history, with no consideration for comorbidities, including T2DM. Building on her previous work in cancer epidemiology, the candidate seeks to determine the association between T2DM and risk of colorectal polyps: overall, by subtypes, and by lesion severity, individually reflecting different molecular pathways (Aim 1); and to examine the risk for colorectal polyps associated with anti-diabetic therapy: overall, by subtypes, and by lesion severity (Aim 2). These aims will be addressed by leveraging the rich resources of an existing colonoscopy- based cohort at the University of Washington Medical Center's (UWMC) Gastroenterology clinic established during 2003-2011. Demographics, select lifestyle factors, and detailed histopathology have been previously abstracted from UWMC's electronic medical records (EMR) database. The candidate proposes to extend this cohort through 2017 (N~38,000), and enhance it by linking existing data with diabetes-related variables from the EMR database using biomedical informatics (e.g., natural language processing, clinical text mining) to estimate the risk for colorectal neoplasia. Using these empirical estimates derived from Aims 1 and 2, the candidate will then build a microsimulation model projecting the risk for colorectal neoplasia in T2DM patients, accounting for their diabetes therapy. Alternative screening and treatment strategies, including altering the screening start-age, modifying diabetes treatment, or altering screening modality among T2DM patients, will be evaluated for their cost-effectiveness (Aim 3). This work may help inform targeted screening recommendations that could, in turn, lower the incidence and mortality of CRC among persons with T2DM, and improve the cost- effectiveness of CRC screening. The candidate has proposed a training and career development plan that builds upon her prior skills in cancer epidemiology to gain experience and proficiency in biomedical informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and health economic modeling and evaluation, including cost-effectiveness approaches. The transdisciplinary mentorship team, comprised of national and international experts, will provide the necessary expertise to ensure the success of this proposal, as well as facilitate the candidate's transition into an independent translational investigator in the field of cancer prevention and screening. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study aims to determine the link between clinically diagnosed type-2 diabetes mellitus, use of anti-diabetic medications, and risk of colorectal polyp subtypes, including differences by lesion severity. Evaluating the cost- effectiveness of CRC screening among persons with type-2 diabetes may help inform targeted screening recommendations, which could, in turn, lower the incidence and mortality of CRC among persons with T2DM, and improve the cost-effectiveness of CRC screening.","Diabetes, Medications and the Cost-Effectiveness of Screening for Colorectal Neoplasia",9998913,K07CA222060,"['Accounting', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Antidiabetic Drugs', 'Award', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Colorectal Polyp', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economic Models', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Family', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical center', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metformin', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Polyps', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Smoking History', 'Subgroup', 'Sulfonylurea Compounds', 'Testing', 'Thiazolidinediones', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Type 2 diabetic', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Weight', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer prevention', 'career', 'career development', 'case control', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer progression', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'comorbidity', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost-effectiveness evaluation', 'demographics', 'diabetes mellitus therapy', 'diabetes risk', 'diabetic', 'economic evaluation', 'experience', 'health economics', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'mortality', 'non-diabetic', 'personalized screening', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'skills', 'success', 'text searching', 'translational scientist', 'treatment strategy']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K07,2020,158153,228951281,0.2075146635683374
"Optimizing long-term post-polypectomy surveillance for colorectal cancer prevention using a prediction rule developed from a large, community-based cohort PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT The purpose of this K07 proposal is to provide Jeffrey Lee, MD, MAS with the protected time and resources to pursue the additional training needed to reach his long-term goal of becoming an independent clinical investigator, focused on colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention. Screening has been shown to reduce the incidence and mortality for CRC. However, screening has resulted in a growing cohort of patients with adenomatous polyps (adenomas) and little is known about effectively managing their post-polypectomy surveillance. With limited data available in the literature to determine the appropriate timing and frequency of follow-up colonoscopy for patients after adenoma removal, recommendations for post-polypectomy surveillance from our national guidelines have been imprecise at best. For example, the currently recommended range of 5-10 years for a surveillance colonoscopy for patients with a single adenoma covers a two-fold difference in exam frequency, with resultant two-fold impact on patient risk, cost, and colonoscopy capacity. To help optimize the timing of colonoscopic surveillance and guide appropriate utilization of this invasive and costly resource, stratification of CRC risk after colonoscopic polypectomy from a large community-based cohort with long-term follow-up is needed. Building on his prior work in CRC screening, Dr. Lee seeks to fill this knowledge gap by optimizing surveillance practices in post-polypectomy patients according to patient-, polyp-, and colonoscopy exam-related factors. Specifically, he will determine the long- term CRC risk in patients after colonoscopic polypectomy in a very large “real world” community-based population (Aim 1). He will also identify patient-, polyp-, and exam-related risk factors associated with incident CRC in these patients (Aim 2). Finally, he will develop a CRC risk prediction model that will identify post- polypectomy patients at high and low risk for developing subsequent CRC (Aim 3). To achieve these goals, Dr. Lee and his mentors have designed a career development plan for research and educational training to obtain: 1) knowledge and expertise in advanced epidemiologic methods for design and analysis of cohort studies; 2) knowledge in medical informatics methods; and 3) predictive modeling skills. To achieve the proposed research aims, Dr. Lee will leverage the rich electronic health records of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large community-based healthcare system, in which data on patient, physician, colonoscopy, pathology, and CRC status have been collected since 1994. In addition, Dr. Lee will use an established natural language processing tool to efficiently collect data and evaluate potential confounding variables from more than 600,000 colonoscopy reports in order to address one of the main practical challenges that have limited the feasibility of large-scale population-based studies. Thus, completion of these aims has the potential to improve prevention and early detection of CRC, impact current surveillance guidelines for post-polypectomy patients, and reduce overuse and underuse of surveillance colonoscopy. Importantly, this proposal is realistic and feasible within the award period and will allow Dr. Lee to continue to build research skills, generate preliminary data, create additional collaborative relationships, and compete for R01 funding. In summary, this K07 award will support and accelerate the career development activities of Dr. Lee and allow him to successfully launch into the next phase of his career as an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized controlled trials have shown that screening reduces the incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. However, screening has resulted in a growing cohort of patients with adenomatous polyps and little is known about effectively managing their post-polypectomy surveillance. Thus in this proposal, we will determine the long-term risk and risk factors of CRC after colonoscopic polypectomy, and develop a CRC risk prediction model to tailor surveillancein post- polypectomy patients using a large, community-based cohort.","Optimizing long-term post-polypectomy surveillance for colorectal cancer prevention using a prediction rule developed from a large, community-based cohort",9986702,K07CA212057,"['Address', 'Adenomatous Polyps', 'Adherence', 'Age', 'Award', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Polypectomy', 'Polyps', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Population Study', 'Prevention', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Scheme', 'Stratification', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'Surveillance Program', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'Writing', 'adenoma', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'premalignant', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'skills', 'surveillance strategy', 'tool']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K07,2020,171720,111231681,0.22876106124653228
"Identification of Microbiome Based Markers to Improve Colorectal Cancer Detection Project Summary One of every 20 Americans develops colorectal cancer (CRC) and, once diagnosed, more than one-third will not survive 5 years. Although screening is available, stool assays such as fecal immunochemical test (FIT) have true positive rates ranging between 64-68% and false positive rate ranging between 5-10%. Moreover, other approaches such as colonoscopy are invasive and expensive and have low rates of patient adherence. There is clearly a need for improved non-invasive methods to screen individuals or subsequent colonoscopy. The current proposal describes using an innovative source of CRC-related biomarkers: the gut microbiome. This collection of bacteria inhabits the gastrointestinal tract and has largely been ignored in previous studies of the etiology and detection of CRC in humans. The long-term goal of this research is to develop biomarkers that improve the detection of CRC and to understand the mechanisms behind the biological changes that increase the risk of developing CRC. The objective of this proposal is to assess the use of microbiome-based fecal biomarkers of CRC. The central hypothesis is that development of colonic adenomas and carcinomas is in part mediated by the gut microbiome and that changes to the microbiome can be used to identify changes in health. Animal studies from have demonstrated that changes in the microbiome can lead to chronic local and systemic inflammation, which promotes the development of CRC. Through a recent collaboration with the University of Michigan members of the Early Detection Research Network Great Lakes New England Clinical Validation Center it was shown that the abundance of bacterial populations within intact feces could significantly improve the ability to detect CRC. The current proposal seeks to demonstrate that combining microbiome-based analyses with standard stool-based analyses will improve CRC detection. Three specific aims are proposed: (i) quantify the sensitivity and specificity of a combined FIT and microbiome model to improve the sensitivity and specificity of detecting SRN, (ii) assess the ability of residual FIT material to serve as a proxy for a whole fecal sample in detecting SRN, and (iii) measure the association between patient characteristics and model performance. The proposed research will yield a significant contribution because for the first time there will be a validated set of biomarkers for CRC that are based on the microbiome that approach the predictive value of colonoscopies for a fraction of the cost. The proposed research is innovative because of its scope, target population and ability to link microbiome composition with a physical sample, access to patient clinical data, and potential opportunities to incorporate data from parallel biomarker validation studies that have used the same samples. Successful completion of these aims will yield a significant translational step in the detection of colonic adenoma with a very real opportunity to develop a robust panel of microbial biomarkers that complement existing technologies. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will yield a significant translational step in the early detection of colon cancers leading to reduced mortality. We seek to improve detection by developing microbiome-based biomarkers that can be screened using a non-invasive approach.

"Improving Colorectal Cancer Screening and Risk Assessment through Deep Learning on Medical Images and Records PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Most colorectal cancer cases start as a small growth, known as a polyp, on the lining of the colon or rectum. Although colorectal polyps are precursors to colorectal cancer, it takes several years for these polyps to potentially transform into cancer. If colorectal polyps are detected early, they can be removed before they can progress to cancer. The microscopic examination of stained tissue from colorectal polyps on glass slides—the practice of histopathology—is a key part of colorectal cancer screening and forms the current basis for prognosis and patient management. Histopathological characterization of polyps is an important principle for determining the risk of colorectal cancer and future rates of surveillance for patients; however, it is time- intensive, requires years of specialized training, and suffers from high variability and low accuracy. In addition, as is evident by the domain literature, other health factors, such as medical and family history, play an important role in colorectal cancer risk; however, they are not considered in current standard guidelines for colorectal cancer risk assessment. Therefore, there is a critical need for computational tools that can incorporate both histopathological and relevant clinical/familial information to help clinicians better characterize colorectal polyps and more accurately assess risk for colorectal cancer. To address this critical need, this application proposes to build a novel, automatic, image-analysis method that can accurately detect and classify different types of colorectal polyps on whole-slide microscopic images. The proposed approach will be able to identify discriminative regions and features on these images for each colorectal polyp type, which will provide support and insight into the automatic detection of colorectal polyps on whole-slide images. Finally, this project will provide an accurate risk prediction model to integrate visual histology features from microscopic images with other risk factors and relevant clinical information from medical records for a comprehensive colorectal cancer risk assessment. The proposed image analysis and prediction methods in this project are based on a novel deep-learning methodology and rely on numerous levels of abstraction for data representation and analysis. The technology developed in this proposal will be rigorously validated on data from patients undergoing colorectal cancer screening at the investigators’ academic medical center and on the records from the New Hampshire statewide colonoscopy data registry. Upon successful completion of this project, the proposed bioinformatics approach is expected to reduce the cognitive burden on pathologists and improve their accuracy and efficiency in the histopathological characterization of colorectal polyps and in subsequent risk assessment and follow-up recommendations. As a result, this project can have a significant, positive impact on improving the efficacy of colorectal cancer screening programs, precision medicine, and public health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States; however, it can be prevented through regular screening. The proposed project is expected to reduce the manual burden and potential errors of diagnosis, risk assessment, and follow-up recommendations in colorectal cancer screening. Therefore, the outcomes of this project can potentially reduce screening time and costs, eliminate undue stress to patients, increase the coverage and accuracy of screening programs, and overall reduce colorectal cancer mortality.",Improving Colorectal Cancer Screening and Risk Assessment through Deep Learning on Medical Images and Records,9869938,R01LM012837,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Polyp', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'New Hampshire', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Polyps', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Study Section', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive load', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer progression', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data registry', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'histopathological examination', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'microscopic imaging', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient health information', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'screening program', 'translational impact', 'tv watching', 'whole slide imaging']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2020,356700,90710179,0.08553967439344598
"Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening PROJECT SUMMARY The guidelines for initiation of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening are currently based on two risk factors: attained age and family history of CRC. Using the principles of precision medicine, we will individually tailor CRC screening recommendations based on the enormous knowledge we now have on genetic and non- genetic factors that predict risk for this disease. This strategy will reduce under and over-utilization of CRC screening, because individual risks vary substantially in the population, and over 80% of all CRC cases occur in those without a positive family history. In Aim 1 we will develop predictive models for CRC, based on genetic (~30M common and rare genotyped or imputed genetic variants) and clinico-epidemiologic variables (over 70 harmonized characteristics), derived from over 40,000 colorectal tumor cases and 46,000 controls. We will identify key predictors, and derive efficient personalized risk-prediction models for early detection of more treatable CRCs as well for CRC prevention, through the identification of advanced colorectal adenomas. In Aim 2 we will calibrate and validate these models in two prospective cohorts of >120,000 participants, including 40,000 minority members, diversity representing racially/ethnically and socioeconomically. These two cohorts (Research Program on Genes, Environment and Health and the Women's Health Initiative Minority cohort) contain genome-wide genotype array and comprehensive risk factor data coupled to data on screening and outcome data, allowing us to test the model's ability to predict risk for CRC and advanced colorectal adenoma across a broadly defined community-based population, and to personalize decision on starting age of screening based on individually specific genetic and environmental risk factors. In Aim 3 we will estimate the population benefit of our risk-stratified screening strategy, based on our risk prediction methods, compared with the current screening recommendations. This comparison will employ the well-tested decision model currently used to inform the United States Preventive Services Task Force CRC screening guidelines. Accomplishing these three aims, our research has the potential to accelerate the translation of a large amount of genetic and epidemiologic research to patient care by predicting advanced adenoma risk, for cancer prevention, and predicting cancer risk, for early cancer detection. Genetic testing is becoming part of routine care and genetic data will increasingly become part of an individual's medical record. Using genetic and non-genetic risk-factor information in clinical and preventive settings is a critical step towards developing precision medicine. Our models will provide recommendations for individually tailored CRC screening and interventions and, because they are personalized, may also increase adherence, maximize the appropriate use of invasive technologies, and guide important next steps towards public health policy development and clinical translation.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) saves lives, but current recommendations for initiation of CRC screening do not use important information on individual genetic, lifestyle and environmental risks for this disease. Our research, in large CRC consortia will accelerate the translation of several decades of genetic and epidemiologic research on CRC risks, to allow for personalized screening decisions, based on an individual's specific genetic and environmental risk factor distributions. This work will ensure that the most comprehensive information will inform novel precision medicine strategies for CRC.  ",Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening,9850545,R01CA206279,"['Adherence', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Communities', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Screening for cancer', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic minority population', 'functional genomics', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'member', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized risk prediction', 'personalized screening', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'rare variant', 'risk prediction model', 'routine care', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2020,617785,758431960,0.29173759283288897
"Comparative Modeling of Effective Policies for Colorectal Cancer Control ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. The long-term goal of our proposed project is to reduce the population burden of CRC by providing the information needed to address key policy questions across the CRC control continuum in an accessible and transparent manner. To accomplish this goal we will use our population-based microsimulation models to: 1) Evaluate the impact of screening as practiced in the US; 2) Inform the debate about the increase in CRC incidence before age 50; 3) Consider the effectiveness of precision of screening and surveillance; 4) Address other emerging issues and opportunities in CRC control; and 5) Use novel methods to improve model accessibility and transparency. Our team will fill critical gaps in knowledge, enabling decision makers to act. New evidence that we will incorporate in our models to better inform CRC control opportunities will be 1) updated information on screening patterns in the US (in collaboration with the Population-based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimen, or PROSPR), 2) data on the increased risk of CRC in persons under age 50 (in collaboration with Rebecca Siegal of the American Cancer Society, who did the seminal work in this area), and 3) state-of-the art colonoscopy screening data to incorporate alternative carcinogenesis pathways in the natural history models (in collaboration with the New Hampshire Colonoscopy Registry). We will synthesize and incorporate the growing body of evidence in the literature to assess the clinical utility of personalized screening and treatment, as well as the potential role for novel computer-aided detection and diagnosis modalities. We will expand our models to project clinical and resource-based outcomes for middle-income countries that are considering the implementation of a screening program. Lastly, there is a critical need to make our models assessible and transparent. To this end we will use high performance computing approaches to develop and apply deep- learning methods for model calibration and model emulation, which will aid in model sharing. The three participating modeling groups are well positioned to carry out this work, bringing a wealth of experience, expertise, and insight to issues related to microsimulation modeling of CRC, and have a proven track record of collaboration and disseminating our work to health policy decision makers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite large increases in screening in the past two decades, colorectal cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Our research has shown that 60% of these deaths could be prevented by better use of available screening interventions.

"Diabetes, Medications and the Cost-Effectiveness of Screening for Colorectal Neoplasia Project Summary/Abstract: The candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator with transdisciplinary expertise in cancer epidemiology, biomedical informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and health economic modeling and evaluation. The focused didactic training, mentorship, and experiential learning through research activities proposed in this award will facilitate the development of critical skills in the pursuit of knowledge to inform and improve cancer prevention and screening. The candidate's research is motivated by the recognition that type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients are at a 30-40% increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC), and that anti-diabetic drugs may also alter CRC risk. Thus, this high-risk group presents an opportunity for targeted screening and early detection of CRC. Currently, CRC screening is based on age and family history, with no consideration for comorbidities, including T2DM. Building on her previous work in cancer epidemiology, the candidate seeks to determine the association between T2DM and risk of colorectal polyps: overall, by subtypes, and by lesion severity, individually reflecting different molecular pathways (Aim 1); and to examine the risk for colorectal polyps associated with anti-diabetic therapy: overall, by subtypes, and by lesion severity (Aim 2). These aims will be addressed by leveraging the rich resources of an existing colonoscopy- based cohort at the University of Washington Medical Center's (UWMC) Gastroenterology clinic established during 2003-2011. Demographics, select lifestyle factors, and detailed histopathology have been previously abstracted from UWMC's electronic medical records (EMR) database. The candidate proposes to extend this cohort through 2017 (N~38,000), and enhance it by linking existing data with diabetes-related variables from the EMR database using biomedical informatics (e.g., natural language processing, clinical text mining) to estimate the risk for colorectal neoplasia. Using these empirical estimates derived from Aims 1 and 2, the candidate will then build a microsimulation model projecting the risk for colorectal neoplasia in T2DM patients, accounting for their diabetes therapy. Alternative screening and treatment strategies, including altering the screening start-age, modifying diabetes treatment, or altering screening modality among T2DM patients, will be evaluated for their cost-effectiveness (Aim 3). This work may help inform targeted screening recommendations that could, in turn, lower the incidence and mortality of CRC among persons with T2DM, and improve the cost- effectiveness of CRC screening. The candidate has proposed a training and career development plan that builds upon her prior skills in cancer epidemiology to gain experience and proficiency in biomedical informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and health economic modeling and evaluation, including cost-effectiveness approaches. The transdisciplinary mentorship team, comprised of national and international experts, will provide the necessary expertise to ensure the success of this proposal, as well as facilitate the candidate's transition into an independent translational investigator in the field of cancer prevention and screening. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study aims to determine the link between clinically diagnosed type-2 diabetes mellitus, use of anti-diabetic medications, and risk of colorectal polyp subtypes, including differences by lesion severity. Evaluating the cost- effectiveness of CRC screening among persons with type-2 diabetes may help inform targeted screening recommendations, which could, in turn, lower the incidence and mortality of CRC among persons with T2DM, and improve the cost-effectiveness of CRC screening.","Diabetes, Medications and the Cost-Effectiveness of Screening for Colorectal Neoplasia",9741106,K07CA222060,"['Accounting', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Antidiabetic Drugs', 'Award', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Colorectal Polyp', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economic Models', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Family', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical center', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metformin', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Polyps', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Smoking History', 'Subgroup', 'Sulfonylurea Compounds', 'Testing', 'Thiazolidinediones', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Type 2 diabetic', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Weight', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer prevention', 'career', 'career development', 'case control', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer progression', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost-effectiveness evaluation', 'demographics', 'diabetes mellitus therapy', 'diabetes risk', 'diabetic', 'economic evaluation', 'experience', 'health economics', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'mortality', 'non-diabetic', 'personalized screening', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'skills', 'success', 'text searching', 'translational scientist', 'treatment strategy']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K07,2019,158153,228951281,0.2075146635683374
"Optimizing long-term post-polypectomy surveillance for colorectal cancer prevention using a prediction rule developed from a large, community-based cohort PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT The purpose of this K07 proposal is to provide Jeffrey Lee, MD, MAS with the protected time and resources to pursue the additional training needed to reach his long-term goal of becoming an independent clinical investigator, focused on colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention. Screening has been shown to reduce the incidence and mortality for CRC. However, screening has resulted in a growing cohort of patients with adenomatous polyps (adenomas) and little is known about effectively managing their post-polypectomy surveillance. With limited data available in the literature to determine the appropriate timing and frequency of follow-up colonoscopy for patients after adenoma removal, recommendations for post-polypectomy surveillance from our national guidelines have been imprecise at best. For example, the currently recommended range of 5-10 years for a surveillance colonoscopy for patients with a single adenoma covers a two-fold difference in exam frequency, with resultant two-fold impact on patient risk, cost, and colonoscopy capacity. To help optimize the timing of colonoscopic surveillance and guide appropriate utilization of this invasive and costly resource, stratification of CRC risk after colonoscopic polypectomy from a large community-based cohort with long-term follow-up is needed. Building on his prior work in CRC screening, Dr. Lee seeks to fill this knowledge gap by optimizing surveillance practices in post-polypectomy patients according to patient-, polyp-, and colonoscopy exam-related factors. Specifically, he will determine the long- term CRC risk in patients after colonoscopic polypectomy in a very large “real world” community-based population (Aim 1). He will also identify patient-, polyp-, and exam-related risk factors associated with incident CRC in these patients (Aim 2). Finally, he will develop a CRC risk prediction model that will identify post- polypectomy patients at high and low risk for developing subsequent CRC (Aim 3). To achieve these goals, Dr. Lee and his mentors have designed a career development plan for research and educational training to obtain: 1) knowledge and expertise in advanced epidemiologic methods for design and analysis of cohort studies; 2) knowledge in medical informatics methods; and 3) predictive modeling skills. To achieve the proposed research aims, Dr. Lee will leverage the rich electronic health records of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large community-based healthcare system, in which data on patient, physician, colonoscopy, pathology, and CRC status have been collected since 1994. In addition, Dr. Lee will use an established natural language processing tool to efficiently collect data and evaluate potential confounding variables from more than 600,000 colonoscopy reports in order to address one of the main practical challenges that have limited the feasibility of large-scale population-based studies. Thus, completion of these aims has the potential to improve prevention and early detection of CRC, impact current surveillance guidelines for post-polypectomy patients, and reduce overuse and underuse of surveillance colonoscopy. Importantly, this proposal is realistic and feasible within the award period and will allow Dr. Lee to continue to build research skills, generate preliminary data, create additional collaborative relationships, and compete for R01 funding. In summary, this K07 award will support and accelerate the career development activities of Dr. Lee and allow him to successfully launch into the next phase of his career as an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized controlled trials have shown that screening reduces the incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. However, screening has resulted in a growing cohort of patients with adenomatous polyps and little is known about effectively managing their post-polypectomy surveillance. Thus in this proposal, we will determine the long-term risk and risk factors of CRC after colonoscopic polypectomy, and develop a CRC risk prediction model to tailor surveillancein post- polypectomy patients using a large, community-based cohort.","Optimizing long-term post-polypectomy surveillance for colorectal cancer prevention using a prediction rule developed from a large, community-based cohort",9766215,K07CA212057,"['Address', 'Adenomatous Polyps', 'Adherence', 'Age', 'Award', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Polypectomy', 'Polyps', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Population Study', 'Premalignant', 'Prevention', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Scheme', 'Stratification', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'Surveillance Program', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'Writing', 'adenoma', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'skills', 'surveillance strategy', 'tool']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K07,2019,171720,111231681,0.22876106124653228
"Combinatorial Biomarkers for Malignant Polyps and Colon Cancer Detection ABSTRACT Technological advancements in colonoscopic and polypectomy procedures have drastically reduced both the incidence and overall mortality due to colorectal cancer (CRC). However, even with the availability of multiple screening tools, only 40% of CRC are diagnosed at early stage, in part due to lack of compliance with follow-up colonoscopy procedure, limited access to colonoscopy. These factors contribute to inappropriate surveillance follow-up as well as development of `interval cancer' within 5-years of a completely negative colonoscopy. Histological characteristic of polypectized polyps (high-risk vs. low-risk) is among major criterion for follow-up surveillance colonoscopy. Given that current surveillance recommendations depend on the histologic type of the polyp, the underdiagnoses of these premalignant precursors often leads to inappropriate follow-up care and therapy, thus contributing to CRC. Our initial screening has identified that a combination of markers i.e. MUC17, MUC5AC and CA19-9 that accurately differentiate benign hyperplastic polyp (HP) from pre-malignant sessile serrated adenoma/polyp (SSA/P) and tubular adenoma (TA). Based on preliminary studies and the identified gaps in diagnosis, we hypothesize that this newly identified marker panel of MUC17, MUC5AC and CA19.9 can accurately classify the major colorectal polyp subtypes, and in conjunction with machine learning tools can provide an economical product for improved patient stratification for better surveillance and prevention of CRC. To meet these milestones, two specific aims are proposed: aim 1 is designed to evaluate the potential of MUC17, MUC5AC and CA19.9 for effective stratification of benign from malignant polyps. The major milestones for this aim is the development of a MUC17, MUC5AC, and CA19.9 immunostaining kit and to evaluate the potential of the combination for differentiating HP, SSA/P and TA in highly suspicious cases with documented inter-observer variability amongst pathologists. Further, aim 2 focuses on the development of polyp differentiation deep learning computational program based upon histology, tissue markers (MUC17, MUC5AC and CA19.9), polyp size, number, and location (the most critical parameters for deciding the interval of surveillance colonoscopy) for accurate surveillance of CRC by colonoscopy. The major milestone is to develop and evaluate the colon cancer polyp stratification algorithm in an independent patient set. Overall, the present phase I SBIR application seeks to advance the CRC field by simplifying and improving CRC precursor classification, thus improving the ease of polyp classification which can facilitate better recommendations for follow-up surveillance colonoscopy. This should in turn further reduce the healthcare burden by improving patient adherence for CRC management, to reduce deaths from CRC. Altogether, results from Phase 1 will lead to validation in a multi-center trial and validation in a clinical setting (CLIA lab) during phase II to form the basis to seek FDA approval of this test for use in hospital testing to provide accurate classification of premalignant polyps. PROJECT NARRATIVE With only 40% of patient diagnosed at an early stage, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths. The present Phase 1 SBIR study aims to harness the diagnostic potential of a combination of biomarkers, clinical characteristic of polyps and CRC as well as machine learning approaches for accurate distinction of malignant polyp/tissues from benign for improving CRC detection and surveillance.",Combinatorial Biomarkers for Malignant Polyps and Colon Cancer Detection,9681054,R43CA235984,"['Adherence', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'American Cancer Society', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'CA-19-9 Antigen', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Polyp', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Endoscopy', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hospitals', 'Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Incidence', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'MUC5AC gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Molecular', 'Mucins', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Polypectomy', 'Polyps', 'Portraits', 'Premalignant', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resected', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Serrated Adenoma', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Societies', 'Stratification', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tubular Adenoma', 'Update', 'Validation', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cohort', 'colon cancer prevention', 'colon cancer screening', 'colonic crypt', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer progression', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'combinatorial', 'compliance behavior', 'deep learning', 'design', 'differential expression', 'follow-up', 'glycosylation', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'mortality', 'patient stratification', 'programs', 'prototype', 'routine screening', 'screening', 'surveillance strategy', 'tool']",NCI,SANGUINE DIAGNOSTICS AND THERAPEUTICS,R43,2019,225000,0,0.2148329805559484
"Improving Colorectal Cancer Screening and Risk Assessment through Deep Learning on Medical Images and Records PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Most colorectal cancer cases start as a small growth, known as a polyp, on the lining of the colon or rectum. Although colorectal polyps are precursors to colorectal cancer, it takes several years for these polyps to potentially transform into cancer. If colorectal polyps are detected early, they can be removed before they can progress to cancer. The microscopic examination of stained tissue from colorectal polyps on glass slides—the practice of histopathology—is a key part of colorectal cancer screening and forms the current basis for prognosis and patient management. Histopathological characterization of polyps is an important principle for determining the risk of colorectal cancer and future rates of surveillance for patients; however, it is time- intensive, requires years of specialized training, and suffers from high variability and low accuracy. In addition, as is evident by the domain literature, other health factors, such as medical and family history, play an important role in colorectal cancer risk; however, they are not considered in current standard guidelines for colorectal cancer risk assessment. Therefore, there is a critical need for computational tools that can incorporate both histopathological and relevant clinical/familial information to help clinicians better characterize colorectal polyps and more accurately assess risk for colorectal cancer. To address this critical need, this application proposes to build a novel, automatic, image-analysis method that can accurately detect and classify different types of colorectal polyps on whole-slide microscopic images. The proposed approach will be able to identify discriminative regions and features on these images for each colorectal polyp type, which will provide support and insight into the automatic detection of colorectal polyps on whole-slide images. Finally, this project will provide an accurate risk prediction model to integrate visual histology features from microscopic images with other risk factors and relevant clinical information from medical records for a comprehensive colorectal cancer risk assessment. The proposed image analysis and prediction methods in this project are based on a novel deep-learning methodology and rely on numerous levels of abstraction for data representation and analysis. The technology developed in this proposal will be rigorously validated on data from patients undergoing colorectal cancer screening at the investigators’ academic medical center and on the records from the New Hampshire statewide colonoscopy data registry. Upon successful completion of this project, the proposed bioinformatics approach is expected to reduce the cognitive burden on pathologists and improve their accuracy and efficiency in the histopathological characterization of colorectal polyps and in subsequent risk assessment and follow-up recommendations. As a result, this project can have a significant, positive impact on improving the efficacy of colorectal cancer screening programs, precision medicine, and public health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States; however, it can be prevented through regular screening. The proposed project is expected to reduce the manual burden and potential errors of diagnosis, risk assessment, and follow-up recommendations in colorectal cancer screening. Therefore, the outcomes of this project can potentially reduce screening time and costs, eliminate undue stress to patients, increase the coverage and accuracy of screening programs, and overall reduce colorectal cancer mortality.",Improving Colorectal Cancer Screening and Risk Assessment through Deep Learning on Medical Images and Records,9658032,R01LM012837,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Age', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Polyp', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'New Hampshire', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Polyps', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Study Section', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive load', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer progression', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data registry', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'histopathological examination', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'microscopic imaging', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'screening program', 'translational impact', 'tv watching', 'whole slide imaging']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2019,356700,90710179,0.08553967439344598
"Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening PROJECT SUMMARY The guidelines for initiation of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening are currently based on two risk factors: attained age and family history of CRC. Using the principles of precision medicine, we will individually tailor CRC screening recommendations based on the enormous knowledge we now have on genetic and non- genetic factors that predict risk for this disease. This strategy will reduce under and over-utilization of CRC screening, because individual risks vary substantially in the population, and over 80% of all CRC cases occur in those without a positive family history. In Aim 1 we will develop predictive models for CRC, based on genetic (~30M common and rare genotyped or imputed genetic variants) and clinico-epidemiologic variables (over 70 harmonized characteristics), derived from over 40,000 colorectal tumor cases and 46,000 controls. We will identify key predictors, and derive efficient personalized risk-prediction models for early detection of more treatable CRCs as well for CRC prevention, through the identification of advanced colorectal adenomas. In Aim 2 we will calibrate and validate these models in two prospective cohorts of >120,000 participants, including 40,000 minority members, diversity representing racially/ethnically and socioeconomically. These two cohorts (Research Program on Genes, Environment and Health and the Women's Health Initiative Minority cohort) contain genome-wide genotype array and comprehensive risk factor data coupled to data on screening and outcome data, allowing us to test the model's ability to predict risk for CRC and advanced colorectal adenoma across a broadly defined community-based population, and to personalize decision on starting age of screening based on individually specific genetic and environmental risk factors. In Aim 3 we will estimate the population benefit of our risk-stratified screening strategy, based on our risk prediction methods, compared with the current screening recommendations. This comparison will employ the well-tested decision model currently used to inform the United States Preventive Services Task Force CRC screening guidelines. Accomplishing these three aims, our research has the potential to accelerate the translation of a large amount of genetic and epidemiologic research to patient care by predicting advanced adenoma risk, for cancer prevention, and predicting cancer risk, for early cancer detection. Genetic testing is becoming part of routine care and genetic data will increasingly become part of an individual's medical record. Using genetic and non-genetic risk-factor information in clinical and preventive settings is a critical step towards developing precision medicine. Our models will provide recommendations for individually tailored CRC screening and interventions and, because they are personalized, may also increase adherence, maximize the appropriate use of invasive technologies, and guide important next steps towards public health policy development and clinical translation.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) saves lives, but current recommendations for initiation of CRC screening do not use important information on individual genetic, lifestyle and environmental risks for this disease. Our research, in large CRC consortia will accelerate the translation of several decades of genetic and epidemiologic research on CRC risks, to allow for personalized screening decisions, based on an individual's specific genetic and environmental risk factor distributions. This work will ensure that the most comprehensive information will inform novel precision medicine strategies for CRC.  ",Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening,9618151,R01CA206279,"['Adherence', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Communities', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Screening for cancer', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic minority population', 'functional genomics', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'member', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized risk prediction', 'personalized screening', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'rare variant', 'risk prediction model', 'routine care', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2019,628904,758431960,0.29173759283288897

Evaluating the cost- effectiveness of CRC screening among persons with type-2 diabetes may help inform targeted screening recommendations, which could, in turn, lower the incidence and mortality of CRC among persons with T2DM, and improve the cost-effectiveness of CRC screening.","Diabetes, Medications and the Cost-Effectiveness of Screening for Colorectal Neoplasia",9599316,K07CA222060,"['Accounting', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Antidiabetic Drugs', 'Award', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Colorectal Polyp', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economic Models', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Family', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical center', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metformin', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Polyps', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Smoking History', 'Subgroup', 'Sulfonylurea Compounds', 'Testing', 'Thiazolidinediones', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Weight', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer type', 'career', 'career development', 'case control', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer progression', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost-effectiveness evaluation', 'demographics', 'diabetes mellitus therapy', 'diabetes risk', 'diabetic', 'economic evaluation', 'experience', 'health economics', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'mortality', 'non-diabetic', 'personalized screening', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'text searching', 'translational scientist', 'treatment strategy']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K07,2018,158153,228951281,0.2075146635683374
"Optimizing long-term post-polypectomy surveillance for colorectal cancer prevention using a prediction rule developed from a large, community-based cohort PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT The purpose of this K07 proposal is to provide Jeffrey Lee, MD, MAS with the protected time and resources to pursue the additional training needed to reach his long-term goal of becoming an independent clinical investigator, focused on colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention. Screening has been shown to reduce the incidence and mortality for CRC. However, screening has resulted in a growing cohort of patients with adenomatous polyps (adenomas) and little is known about effectively managing their post-polypectomy surveillance. With limited data available in the literature to determine the appropriate timing and frequency of follow-up colonoscopy for patients after adenoma removal, recommendations for post-polypectomy surveillance from our national guidelines have been imprecise at best. For example, the currently recommended range of 5-10 years for a surveillance colonoscopy for patients with a single adenoma covers a two-fold difference in exam frequency, with resultant two-fold impact on patient risk, cost, and colonoscopy capacity. To help optimize the timing of colonoscopic surveillance and guide appropriate utilization of this invasive and costly resource, stratification of CRC risk after colonoscopic polypectomy from a large community-based cohort with long-term follow-up is needed. Building on his prior work in CRC screening, Dr. Lee seeks to fill this knowledge gap by optimizing surveillance practices in post-polypectomy patients according to patient-, polyp-, and colonoscopy exam-related factors. Specifically, he will determine the long- term CRC risk in patients after colonoscopic polypectomy in a very large “real world” community-based population (Aim 1). He will also identify patient-, polyp-, and exam-related risk factors associated with incident CRC in these patients (Aim 2). Finally, he will develop a CRC risk prediction model that will identify post- polypectomy patients at high and low risk for developing subsequent CRC (Aim 3). To achieve these goals, Dr. Lee and his mentors have designed a career development plan for research and educational training to obtain: 1) knowledge and expertise in advanced epidemiologic methods for design and analysis of cohort studies; 2) knowledge in medical informatics methods; and 3) predictive modeling skills. To achieve the proposed research aims, Dr. Lee will leverage the rich electronic health records of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large community-based healthcare system, in which data on patient, physician, colonoscopy, pathology, and CRC status have been collected since 1994. In addition, Dr. Lee will use an established natural language processing tool to efficiently collect data and evaluate potential confounding variables from more than 600,000 colonoscopy reports in order to address one of the main practical challenges that have limited the feasibility of large-scale population-based studies. Thus, completion of these aims has the potential to improve prevention and early detection of CRC, impact current surveillance guidelines for post-polypectomy patients, and reduce overuse and underuse of surveillance colonoscopy. Importantly, this proposal is realistic and feasible within the award period and will allow Dr. Lee to continue to build research skills, generate preliminary data, create additional collaborative relationships, and compete for R01 funding. In summary, this K07 award will support and accelerate the career development activities of Dr. Lee and allow him to successfully launch into the next phase of his career as an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized controlled trials have shown that screening reduces the incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. However, screening has resulted in a growing cohort of patients with adenomatous polyps and little is known about effectively managing their post-polypectomy surveillance. Thus in this proposal, we will determine the long-term risk and risk factors of CRC after colonoscopic polypectomy, and develop a CRC risk prediction model to tailor surveillancein post- polypectomy patients using a large, community-based cohort.","Optimizing long-term post-polypectomy surveillance for colorectal cancer prevention using a prediction rule developed from a large, community-based cohort",9543446,K07CA212057,"['Address', 'Adenomatous Polyps', 'Adherence', 'Age', 'Award', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Polypectomy', 'Polyps', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Population Study', 'Premalignant', 'Prevention', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Scheme', 'Stratification', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'Surveillance Program', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'Writing', 'adenoma', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'screening', 'skills', 'surveillance strategy', 'tool']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K07,2018,171720,111231681,0.22876106124653228
"Identification of Microbiome Based Markers to Improve Colorectal Cancer Detection Project Summary One of every 20 Americans develops colorectal cancer (CRC) and, once diagnosed, more than one-third will not survive 5 years. Although screening is available, stool assays such as fecal immunochemical test (FIT) have true positive rates ranging between 64-68% and false positive rate ranging between 5-10%. Moreover, other approaches such as colonoscopy are invasive and expensive and have low rates of patient adherence. There is clearly a need for improved non-invasive methods to screen individuals or subsequent colonoscopy. The current proposal describes using an innovative source of CRC-related biomarkers: the gut microbiome. This collection of bacteria inhabits the gastrointestinal tract and has largely been ignored in previous studies of the etiology and detection of CRC in humans. The long-term goal of this research is to develop biomarkers that improve the detection of CRC and to understand the mechanisms behind the biological changes that increase the risk of developing CRC. The objective of this proposal is to assess the use of microbiome-based fecal biomarkers of CRC. The central hypothesis is that development of colonic adenomas and carcinomas is in part mediated by the gut microbiome and that changes to the microbiome can be used to identify changes in health. Animal studies from have demonstrated that changes in the microbiome can lead to chronic local and systemic inflammation, which promotes the development of CRC. Through a recent collaboration with the University of Michigan members of the Early Detection Research Network Great Lakes New England Clinical Validation Center it was shown that the abundance of bacterial populations within intact feces could significantly improve the ability to detect CRC. The current proposal seeks to demonstrate that combining microbiome-based analyses with standard stool-based analyses will improve CRC detection. Three specific aims are proposed: (i) quantify the sensitivity and specificity of a combined FIT and microbiome model to improve the sensitivity and specificity of detecting SRN, (ii) assess the ability of residual FIT material to serve as a proxy for a whole fecal sample in detecting SRN, and (iii) measure the association between patient characteristics and model performance. The proposed research will yield a significant contribution because for the first time there will be a validated set of biomarkers for CRC that are based on the microbiome that approach the predictive value of colonoscopies for a fraction of the cost. The proposed research is innovative because of its scope, target population and ability to link microbiome composition with a physical sample, access to patient clinical data, and potential opportunities to incorporate data from parallel biomarker validation studies that have used the same samples. Successful completion of these aims will yield a significant translational step in the detection of colonic adenoma with a very real opportunity to develop a robust panel of microbial biomarkers that complement existing technologies. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will yield a significant translational step in the early detection of colon cancers leading to reduced mortality. We seek to improve detection by developing microbiome-based biomarkers that can be screened using a non-invasive approach. Thus the research is relevant to the part of NCI’s mission to support research into the diagnosis of cancer.",Identification of Microbiome Based Markers to Improve Colorectal Cancer Detection,9446030,R01CA215574,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'American', 'Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonic Adenoma', 'Colonic Diseases', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complement', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dysplasia', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hemoglobin concentration result', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intake', 'Large Intestine Carcinoma', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Screening', 'Materials Testing', 'Measures', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasms', 'New England', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resected', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Somatic Cell', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker validation', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cohort', 'colon cancer screening', 'colon carcinogenesis', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'fecal microbiome', 'forest', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'rRNA Genes', 'screening', 'stool sample', 'validation studies']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,627529,641965656,0.16704405754713467
"Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening PROJECT SUMMARY The guidelines for initiation of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening are currently based on two risk factors: attained age and family history of CRC. Using the principles of precision medicine, we will individually tailor CRC screening recommendations based on the enormous knowledge we now have on genetic and non- genetic factors that predict risk for this disease. This strategy will reduce under and over-utilization of CRC screening, because individual risks vary substantially in the population, and over 80% of all CRC cases occur in those without a positive family history. In Aim 1 we will develop predictive models for CRC, based on genetic (~30M common and rare genotyped or imputed genetic variants) and clinico-epidemiologic variables (over 70 harmonized characteristics), derived from over 40,000 colorectal tumor cases and 46,000 controls. We will identify key predictors, and derive efficient personalized risk-prediction models for early detection of more treatable CRCs as well for CRC prevention, through the identification of advanced colorectal adenomas. In Aim 2 we will calibrate and validate these models in two prospective cohorts of >120,000 participants, including 40,000 minority members, diversity representing racially/ethnically and socioeconomically. These two cohorts (Research Program on Genes, Environment and Health and the Women's Health Initiative Minority cohort) contain genome-wide genotype array and comprehensive risk factor data coupled to data on screening and outcome data, allowing us to test the model's ability to predict risk for CRC and advanced colorectal adenoma across a broadly defined community-based population, and to personalize decision on starting age of screening based on individually specific genetic and environmental risk factors. In Aim 3 we will estimate the population benefit of our risk-stratified screening strategy, based on our risk prediction methods, compared with the current screening recommendations. This comparison will employ the well-tested decision model currently used to inform the United States Preventive Services Task Force CRC screening guidelines. Accomplishing these three aims, our research has the potential to accelerate the translation of a large amount of genetic and epidemiologic research to patient care by predicting advanced adenoma risk, for cancer prevention, and predicting cancer risk, for early cancer detection. Genetic testing is becoming part of routine care and genetic data will increasingly become part of an individual's medical record. Using genetic and non-genetic risk-factor information in clinical and preventive settings is a critical step towards developing precision medicine. Our models will provide recommendations for individually tailored CRC screening and interventions and, because they are personalized, may also increase adherence, maximize the appropriate use of invasive technologies, and guide important next steps towards public health policy development and clinical translation.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) saves lives, but current recommendations for initiation of CRC screening do not use important information on individual genetic, lifestyle and environmental risks for this disease. Our research, in large CRC consortia will accelerate the translation of several decades of genetic and epidemiologic research on CRC risks, to allow for personalized screening decisions, based on an individual's specific genetic and environmental risk factor distributions. This work will ensure that the most comprehensive information will inform novel precision medicine strategies for CRC.  ",Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening,9407289,R01CA206279,"['Adherence', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Communities', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Screening for cancer', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic minority population', 'functional genomics', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'member', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized risk prediction', 'personalized screening', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'rare variant', 'routine care', 'screening', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2018,674450,758431960,0.29173759283288897

"Reducing Colorectal Cancer Disparities: Racial Differences in Colorectal Polyp Profile ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer and cancer deaths in the United States, about 136,000 new cases diagnosed and 50,000 dying from the disease each year. CRC racial disparities (26% higher incidence among Blacks and 52% higher mortality) have persisted at pre-2000 levels despite significant strides in population-wide colonoscopy screening. Nearly 60% of both Whites and Blacks are now covered by colonoscopy screening. Current screening recommendations (initiation of screening at 50 years of age regardless of race) are driven by an assumption that the prevailing CRC disparities are largely due to differences in access to screening and the quality of post diagnostic care.  However, in younger age groups, Blacks have twice the CRC incidence rate as Whites, and their stage- adjusted CRC survival rates are lower than Whites. Assuming that most CRCs arise from precancerous polyps that evolve into cancer, it is plausible that Blacks experience earlier polyp initiation and more rapid polyp progression to cancer. If such is the case, one potential factor in the persistent CRC disparities may be the race-neutral age guideline for screening initiation. However there is no direct evidence regarding age-related Black-White differences in precancerous polyps and the indicators of progression through the intermediate stages (polyp size and dysplastic histology). To establish such evidence, it requires a data source representing the polyp prevalence and profile in the population. In the absence of a large enough autopsy study, the next best alternative is a colonoscopy series validated to have achieved near-complete polyp clearance, and having complete polyp documentation. No such data source has been available so far.  Our study will leverage a unique polyp database generated by a previous NIH-funded study. It represents the nearest possible proxy to the population polyp prevalence and profile, and has sufficient statistical power to compare Blacks and Whites on polyp prevalence and cancer-relevant features within age strata. It is a large and well-documented database of a single-center colonoscopy series which is externally validated to have achieved near-complete polyp clearance: this cohort experienced 83% CRC incidence reduction and 89% CRC mortality reduction relative to the general South Carolina population over a 4.9-year of follow-up period. The rates are similar to those of the only colonoscopy clinical trial so far.  We will use data on ~17,681 colonoscopy patients with ~32,900 polyps (54% Black), and CRC data on this cohort obtained from the South Carolina Central Cancer Registry. We will study Black-White differences within 5-10 year age strata in: the presence of polyps, polyp number and features (size, histology, anatomic location, dysplasia status, and cancer), as well as combinations of these factors. We will use univariate statistical tests, multiple regressio (binary and ordered polynomial logistic regression, linear and Poisson regression) and cluster analysis. We will use sensitivity analyses to account for potential bias in the sample. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial disparities in colorectal cancer (CRC) have remained unabated from pre-2000 levels despite significant strides in population-wide colonoscopy screening. Studies suggest the plausibility of earlier initiation and more rapid polyp progression to cancer among Blacks although direct evidence is lacking. This study will explore a unique dataset generated by a previous study to investigate this question and could potentially facilitate changes in the recommended screening age and frequency for Blacks with implications for reducing CRC racial disparities.",Reducing Colorectal Cancer Disparities: Racial Differences in Colorectal Polyp Profile,9195710,R21CA202477,"['Age', 'Age-Years', 'Anatomy', 'Autopsy', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Carpet', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Polyp', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Depressed mood', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Documentation', 'Dysplasia', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Histology', 'Hyperplasia', 'Incidence', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Polynomial Models', 'Polyps', 'Population', 'Precancerous Polyp', 'Premalignant', 'Prevalence', 'Proxy', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'South Carolina', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Tubular formation', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Villous', 'adenoma', 'age group', 'age related', 'aged', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer risk', 'cohort', 'early experience', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'male', 'mortality', 'mortality disparity', 'neoplasm registry', 'public health relevance', 'racial difference', 'racial disparity', 'screening', 'tv watching']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R21,2017,130070,45219910,0.23478534344257812

This work will ensure that the most comprehensive information will inform novel precision medicine strategies for CRC.  ",Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening,9237818,R01CA206279,"['Adherence', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Colon', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Communities', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Screening for cancer', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic minority population', 'functional genomics', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'member', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized screening', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'rare variant', 'routine care', 'screening', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2017,738377,758431960,0.29173759283288897
"miRNA and colorectal cancer: associations with tumor phenotype and survival DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a class of small regulatory RNAs that mediate post-transcriptional silencing of specific target mRNAs. Our overall hypotheses are that miRNA expression is unique to tumor molecular phenotype; that miRNA expression levels at time of diagnosis predicts survival; and that miRNA expression is associated with inflammation-related genetic and lifestyle factors key to colorectal cancer (CRC). This study takes a two pronged approach to addressing our hypotheses. While we propose to validate previously identified miRNAs that have been identified as associated with CRC (either by differential expression or from assessment of mutations), we will add to the field through discovery of new and important associations that may be unique to specific molecular phenotypes, to polyp to cancer progression, and to survival. We will analyze the expression of 866 human miRNAs using data derived from tumor and paired normal tissue at time of diagnosis from: 1660 people with incident colon cancer; 840 people with incident rectal cancer; and 350 polyps from our colon and rectal cases who reported a prior polyp; 5% of tumors, will be analyzed for quality control. Our total assessment will be on 5475 samples. We will extend the validation of previously identified mutated miRNAs and differentially expressed miRNAs to determine if these alterations are associated with specific tumor molecular phenotype, inflammation-related factors, clinical factors and survival. Important miRNAs will be validated using TaqMan-based assays. Associations will be tested based on differential expression for both individual and groups of miRNAs using recent extensions of several statistical methods including ANOVA, logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazards models. Our sample size allows for both a training and validation component, and provides sufficient statistical power to meet the study goals. MiRNAs that are differentially expressed in polyps and in subsequent tumors will provide new insights into targets for screening and treatment and differential miRNAs that function as the ""driver"" vs. the ""passenger"" in the carcinogenic process. Testing of mutated miRNAs identified from sequencing in conjunction with tumor phenotype, clinical, and survival data will further validate the importance of these miRNAs, and provide insight as to which CRC molecular pathway the miRNAs function.

"Reducing Colorectal Cancer Disparities: Racial Differences in Colorectal Polyp Profile ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer and cancer deaths in the United States, about 136,000 new cases diagnosed and 50,000 dying from the disease each year. CRC racial disparities (26% higher incidence among Blacks and 52% higher mortality) have persisted at pre-2000 levels despite significant strides in population-wide colonoscopy screening. Nearly 60% of both Whites and Blacks are now covered by colonoscopy screening. Current screening recommendations (initiation of screening at 50 years of age regardless of race) are driven by an assumption that the prevailing CRC disparities are largely due to differences in access to screening and the quality of post diagnostic care.  However, in younger age groups, Blacks have twice the CRC incidence rate as Whites, and their stage- adjusted CRC survival rates are lower than Whites. Assuming that most CRCs arise from precancerous polyps that evolve into cancer, it is plausible that Blacks experience earlier polyp initiation and more rapid polyp progression to cancer. If such is the case, one potential factor in the persistent CRC disparities may be the race-neutral age guideline for screening initiation. However there is no direct evidence regarding age-related Black-White differences in precancerous polyps and the indicators of progression through the intermediate stages (polyp size and dysplastic histology). To establish such evidence, it requires a data source representing the polyp prevalence and profile in the population. In the absence of a large enough autopsy study, the next best alternative is a colonoscopy series validated to have achieved near-complete polyp clearance, and having complete polyp documentation. No such data source has been available so far.  Our study will leverage a unique polyp database generated by a previous NIH-funded study. It represents the nearest possible proxy to the population polyp prevalence and profile, and has sufficient statistical power to compare Blacks and Whites on polyp prevalence and cancer-relevant features within age strata. It is a large and well-documented database of a single-center colonoscopy series which is externally validated to have achieved near-complete polyp clearance: this cohort experienced 83% CRC incidence reduction and 89% CRC mortality reduction relative to the general South Carolina population over a 4.9-year of follow-up period. The rates are similar to those of the only colonoscopy clinical trial so far.  We will use data on ~17,681 colonoscopy patients with ~32,900 polyps (54% Black), and CRC data on this cohort obtained from the South Carolina Central Cancer Registry. We will study Black-White differences within 5-10 year age strata in: the presence of polyps, polyp number and features (size, histology, anatomic location, dysplasia status, and cancer), as well as combinations of these factors. We will use univariate statistical tests, multiple regressio (binary and ordered polynomial logistic regression, linear and Poisson regression) and cluster analysis. We will use sensitivity analyses to account for potential bias in the sample. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial disparities in colorectal cancer (CRC) have remained unabated from pre-2000 levels despite significant strides in population-wide colonoscopy screening. Studies suggest the plausibility of earlier initiation and more rapid polyp progression to cancer among Blacks although direct evidence is lacking.

"Optimizing long-term post-polypectomy surveillance for colorectal cancer prevention using a prediction rule developed from a large, community-based cohort PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT The purpose of this K07 proposal is to provide Jeffrey Lee, MD, MAS with the protected time and resources to pursue the additional training needed to reach his long-term goal of becoming an independent clinical investigator, focused on colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention. Screening has been shown to reduce the incidence and mortality for CRC. However, screening has resulted in a growing cohort of patients with adenomatous polyps (adenomas) and little is known about effectively managing their post-polypectomy surveillance. With limited data available in the literature to determine the appropriate timing and frequency of follow-up colonoscopy for patients after adenoma removal, recommendations for post-polypectomy surveillance from our national guidelines have been imprecise at best. For example, the currently recommended range of 5-10 years for a surveillance colonoscopy for patients with a single adenoma covers a two-fold difference in exam frequency, with resultant two-fold impact on patient risk, cost, and colonoscopy capacity. To help optimize the timing of colonoscopic surveillance and guide appropriate utilization of this invasive and costly resource, stratification of CRC risk after colonoscopic polypectomy from a large community-based cohort with long-term follow-up is needed. Building on his prior work in CRC screening, Dr. Lee seeks to fill this knowledge gap by optimizing surveillance practices in post-polypectomy patients according to patient-, polyp-, and colonoscopy exam-related factors. Specifically, he will determine the long- term CRC risk in patients after colonoscopic polypectomy in a very large “real world” community-based population (Aim 1). He will also identify patient-, polyp-, and exam-related risk factors associated with incident CRC in these patients (Aim 2). Finally, he will develop a CRC risk prediction model that will identify post- polypectomy patients at high and low risk for developing subsequent CRC (Aim 3). To achieve these goals, Dr. Lee and his mentors have designed a career development plan for research and educational training to obtain: 1) knowledge and expertise in advanced epidemiologic methods for design and analysis of cohort studies; 2) knowledge in medical informatics methods; and 3) predictive modeling skills. To achieve the proposed research aims, Dr. Lee will leverage the rich electronic health records of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large community-based healthcare system, in which data on patient, physician, colonoscopy, pathology, and CRC status have been collected since 1994. In addition, Dr. Lee will use an established natural language processing tool to efficiently collect data and evaluate potential confounding variables from more than 600,000 colonoscopy reports in order to address one of the main practical challenges that have limited the feasibility of large-scale population-based studies. Thus, completion of these aims has the potential to improve prevention and early detection of CRC, impact current surveillance guidelines for post-polypectomy patients, and reduce overuse and underuse of surveillance colonoscopy. Importantly, this proposal is realistic and feasible within the award period and will allow Dr. Lee to continue to build research skills, generate preliminary data, create additional collaborative relationships, and compete for R01 funding. In summary, this K07 award will support and accelerate the career development activities of Dr. Lee and allow him to successfully launch into the next phase of his career as an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized controlled trials have shown that screening reduces the incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. However, screening has resulted in a growing cohort of patients with adenomatous polyps and little is known about effectively managing their post-polypectomy surveillance. Thus in this proposal, we will determine the long-term risk and risk factors of CRC after colonoscopic polypectomy, and develop a CRC risk prediction model to tailor surveillancein post- polypectomy patients using a large, community-based cohort.","Optimizing long-term post-polypectomy surveillance for colorectal cancer prevention using a prediction rule developed from a large, community-based cohort",9224101,K07CA212057,"['Address', 'Adenomatous Polyps', 'Adherence', 'Age', 'Award', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancerous', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Polypectomy', 'Polyps', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scheme', 'Stratification', 'Surveillance Program', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Writing', 'adenoma', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'screening', 'skills', 'surveillance strategy', 'tool']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K07,2016,177057,685608202,0.22876106124653228

"Integrated Genomic Discovery and Functional Validation of Colorectal Cancer Loci DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) arises from multiple mutations and genomic aberrations in distinct driver cancer genes that that in concert to spur neoplastic development and phenotype. This inherent genetic complexity greatly complicates both personalized diagnosis and treatment. Previously published studies have confined that large numbers of genes will be mutated or subject to genomic aberrations in CRC. A significant and emerging challenge for the post-genomic era is to identify which of these mutated genes are ""driver"" loci that functionally drive colon cancer development, versus ""passenger"" loci without functional relevance. Finally, it is of the highest priority that one forges these genetic observations with correlations of prognosis and clinical outcome. This can only be done if we better understand the unified biological ramifications of the combined and diverse multigenic driver background which act synergistically to promote CRC tumorigenesis. This proposal details an integrated analysis that will rely on the CRC genomic data generated by the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) to discover novel candidate CRC genes and study multigenic CRC driver gene co-mutated / dysregulated modules within the genetic context of other drivers and provide biological validation in a powerful in vitro primary culture CRC model which can be engineered for multiple genetic events.  To accomplish these goals, we will develop and implement novel statistical methodologies for the integrative analysis of multiple TCGA genomic and clinical data sets. The goal is to identify and prioritize novel CRC genes either singly or as co-mutated modules in combination with other known ""driver"" CRC genes. We will use the rich TCGA data set to conduct an integrated CRC genomic analysis of point mutations, gene expression, copy number aberrations and methylation data. We will prioritize the discovery of mutations and other genomic aberrations of these novel CRC genes that are associated with specific clinical stages of disease and other clinical parameters.  These statistical and computational studies will then be directly coupled to rapid and robust functional target validation of candidate loci using our rigorously characterized in vitro primary intestinal culture methodology (Gotani et al, Nature Medicine, 2009), in which we have recently established the transforming activity of established CRC loci such as APC, KRAS and TP53. Genetic deletion and retroviral expression of shRNA, cDNA or mutants thereof will be utilized to evaluate putative individual driver loci, as well as combinatorial oncogene modules. This proposal directly addresses fundamental problems in the exploration and translation of novel colorectal cancer gene discovery in the context of clinical data which is available from TCGA. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States. This proposal utilizes a fusion of genomic analysis of a large population of patients, mathematical modeling and culture of intestinal fragments to functionally identify genes that are critical for colon cancer development. These studies have implications for generation of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for colon cancer. n/a",Integrated Genomic Discovery and Functional Validation of Colorectal Cancer Loci,8916038,U01CA151920,"['Address', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complementary DNA', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intestines', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Large Intestine Carcinoma', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Point Mutation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Staging', 'Statistical Study', 'Surveys', 'Systems Biology', 'TP53 gene', 'Technology', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'authority', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'candidate validation', 'clinical phenotype', 'combinatorial', 'computer studies', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'forging', 'gene discovery', 'genome-wide', 'intestinal epithelium', 'mathematical model', 'mutant', 'neoplastic', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'segregation', 'small hairpin RNA', 'statistics', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2015,538250,560644462,0.23020956469983464
"Development of a comprehensive model for colorectal cancer risk prediction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) varies widely across the population. Statistical models have shown that there must be wide variation in the underlying 'familial risk profile' necessary to explain the well-established familial risks of CRC. On top of this, CRC risk is determined by personal characteristics and exposures to many environmental factors. Current screening guidelines use only age and rudimentary metrics of family history to stratify individuals to different regimens. To date, there are no CRC risk prediction models that integrate data on family history (including ages, ages at diagnoses, and relationships across multiple generations) and all known genetic factors, let alone environmental factors and personal characteristics associated with CRC risk. Our goal is to develop a comprehensive risk prediction model that will deliver an accurate individual risk prediction across the full spectrum of risk by using explicit family history data, as well as data on the presence or absence of all known genetic and environmental risk factors. This model will facilitate more appropriate screening recommendations to reduce the burden of disease. We will do this using data from a fully characterized, population-based study with comprehensively measured known and suspected risk factors including personal characteristics, environmental risk factors, complex family history, and measured genetic variants. We have at our disposal the Colon Cancer Family Registry, a large, prospective, international resource of families and individuals who span the continuum of risk for CRC, recruited from the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand since 1998. Participants have: (i) been tested for mutations in the mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2) and MUTYH, and measured for the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) known to be associated with CRC; (ii) provided a multi-generational pedigree and family cancer history which has been validated where possible; and (iii) completed a risk factor questionnaire at baseline and every five years. We will accomplish our goal by addressing two aims. The first is to develop the CRC risk prediction model using measured genetic information, the multi-generational cancer family history data, and the information on all known risk factors. We will apply segregation analysis and logistic regression to data from 29,701 individuals from 12,902 population-based families. The second aim is to test the validity of the CRC risk prediction model and to determine its incremental value over existing models using prospective data. We will determine how well, in terms of calibration and predictive capacity, the model's predicted CRC risks (based on their baseline data) predict the CRC diagnoses occurring during the follow-up of the sub-cohort individuals with no history of CRC at baseline (19,390 with five-year follow-up of which 8,657 have 10-year follow-up). This comprehensive CRC risk prediction model will have many uses, including helping the development of targeted, population-wide screening strategies in which recommendations as to initiation age, frequency and modality, are tailored appropriately to predicted risks so as to increase the value and cost-effectiveness of screening.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will develop a comprehensive CRC risk prediction model that will accurately stratify individuals according to their levels of risk, basedon all known risk factors including genetic, environmental and personal characteristics. This model will aid the development of more appropriate screening recommendations and facilitate the application of mutation testing in a more effective manner. Our model is timely and offers the potential to change clinical practice and direct public health initiatives by moving resources to those people more likely to benefit from specific surveillance protocols or genetic tests.",Development of a comprehensive model for colorectal cancer risk prediction,8720722,R01CA170122,"['Address', 'Age', 'Australia', 'Calibration', 'Canada', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family Cancer History', 'Family Characteristics', 'Family history of', 'Frequencies', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Logistic Regressions', 'MLH1 gene', 'MSH2 gene', 'MSH6 gene', 'Measures', 'Metric', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'New Zealand', 'PMS2 gene', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Models', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'colon cancer family registry', 'cost effectiveness', 'follow-up', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'mortality', 'population based', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'segregation']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2014,280342,758431960,0.21621206098007112
"Genetic risk factors in African American colorectal cancer patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a serious public health problem that affects African Americans (AA) disproportionately. Both incidence rates and morbidity and mortality is higher in AAs than in other Americans. Family history, that is, genetic risk, remains one of the most important factors in recommendations for screening. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified 10 independent regions harboring genetic risk factors in CRC in populations of European ancestry. Using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from these studies, we have obtained evidence of association in four of these regions in AA CRC. Our goal is to identify the functional genetic risk factors, quantify their effects, and determine their functions. To pursue this goal, we propose four Aims. (1) We will validate previously identified candidate CRC-associated regions in AA CRC cases and controls. We will use Sequenom genotyping and tag SNPs from these regions to identify SNPs associated with CRC in AAs. We will use 100 ancestry informative markers to perform a structured logistic regression analysis that takes into account possible population stratification based on ancestry. Because AAs are more diverse than European Americans, these studies will very likely lead to better localization of the genetic risk factors. (2) We will use Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology to conduct a resequencing analysis of each candidate genetic region in 96 (48 CRC and 48 controls) persons with CRC. The region that we resequence will be guided by the genes and linkage disequilibrium observed in each CRC-associated region. (3) We will better quantify the effects of the genetic risk factors in each region. We will perform a bioinformatics analysis to identify putative functional variants. These functional candidates along with our novel genetic variants in CRC-associated regions will be genotyped in up to 2000 AA cases and 2000 AA control. We will perform structured logistic regression analysis to obtain the strongest genotype relative risks in each CRC-associated regions. (4) The foregoing analyses will provide a short-list of candidate genetic risk factors for each CRC-associated region. We will begin to characterize the molecular basis of CRC risk for each region by functional assays designed based on the putative mechanism caused by the genetic variants (regulatory or enzymatic). Molecular assays (for example, luciferase reporter assays) will be designed to determine the functional impact of candidate genetic risk factors.

"Integrated Genomic Discovery and Functional Validation of Colorectal Cancer Loci    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) arises from multiple mutations and genomic aberrations in distinct driver cancer genes that that in concert to spur neoplastic development and phenotype. This inherent genetic complexity greatly complicates both personalized diagnosis and treatment. Previously published studies have confined that large numbers of genes will be mutated or subject to genomic aberrations in CRC. A significant and emerging challenge for the post-genomic era is to identify which of these mutated genes are ""driver"" loci that functionally drive colon cancer development, versus ""passenger"" loci without functional relevance. Finally, it is of the highest priority that one forges these genetic observations with correlations of prognosis and clinical outcome. This can only be done if we better understand the unified biological ramifications of the combined and diverse multigenic driver background which act synergistically to promote CRC tumorigenesis. This proposal details an integrated analysis that will rely on the CRC genomic data generated by the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) to discover novel candidate CRC genes and study multigenic CRC driver gene co-mutated / dysregulated modules within the genetic context of other drivers and provide biological validation in a powerful in vitro primary culture CRC model which can be engineered for multiple genetic events.  To accomplish these goals, we will develop and implement novel statistical methodologies for the integrative analysis of multiple TCGA genomic and clinical data sets.

"miRNA and colorectal cancer: associations with tumor phenotype and survival     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a class of small regulatory RNAs that mediate post-transcriptional silencing of specific target mRNAs. Our overall hypotheses are that miRNA expression is unique to tumor molecular phenotype; that miRNA expression levels at time of diagnosis predicts survival; and that miRNA expression is associated with inflammation-related genetic and lifestyle factors key to colorectal cancer (CRC). This study takes a two pronged approach to addressing our hypotheses. While we propose to validate previously identified miRNAs that have been identified as associated with CRC (either by differential expression or from assessment of mutations), we will add to the field through discovery of new and important associations that may be unique to specific molecular phenotypes, to polyp to cancer progression, and to survival. We will analyze the expression of 866 human miRNAs using data derived from tumor and paired normal tissue at time of diagnosis from: 1660 people with incident colon cancer; 840 people with incident rectal cancer; and 350 polyps from our colon and rectal cases who reported a prior polyp; 5% of tumors, will be analyzed for quality control. Our total assessment will be on 5475 samples. We will extend the validation of previously identified mutated miRNAs and differentially expressed miRNAs to determine if these alterations are associated with specific tumor molecular phenotype, inflammation-related factors, clinical factors and survival. Important miRNAs will be validated using TaqMan-based assays. Associations will be tested based on differential expression for both individual and groups of miRNAs using recent extensions of several statistical methods including ANOVA, logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazards models. Our sample size allows for both a training and validation component, and provides sufficient statistical power to meet the study goals. MiRNAs that are differentially expressed in polyps and in subsequent tumors will provide new insights into targets for screening and treatment and differential miRNAs that function as the ""driver"" vs. the ""passenger"" in the carcinogenic process. Testing of mutated miRNAs identified from sequencing in conjunction with tumor phenotype, clinical, and survival data will further validate the importance of these miRNAs, and provide insight as to which CRC molecular pathway the miRNAs function. Our rich dataset of lifestyle, genetic, clinical and prognosis, and tumor molecular phenotype on 2500 CRC and paired normal tissue allows us to examine factors that are associated with miRNAs in a large set of population-based cases. The miRNAs identified in these analyses will elucidate pathways important in the etiology of CRC and will provide insight into potential targets for screening and treatment.          Our rich dataset of lifestyle, genetic, clinical and prognosis, and tumor molecular phenotype on 2500 CRC (colorectal cancer) and paired normal tissue allows us to examine factors that are associated with miRNA expression and mutation in a large sample of population-based cases. Having data available on polyps from those cases who developed cancer, will help us determine ""drivers"" vs. ""passengers"" in the carcinogenic process.

"Measurement of Inappropriate Screening Tests (MIST)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although routine screening can reduce colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality, some screened patients may not be appropriate for screening. We define inappropriate screening as screening at intervals that are shorter than recommended by guidelines, screening high-risk patients with a method other than colonoscopy, and screening when the patient is unlikely to benefit because they are under age 50 over age 85 or of have a life expectancy of less than 5 years. Inappropriate CRC screening strains scarce gastroenterology resources, increases costs of healthcare, and exposes patients to inconvenience, stress and medical risks, including death. Little is known about the prevalence of inappropriate screening beyond single site estimates. Nor do we know about inter-facility variation or its causes. Both computerized clinical reminders (CCRs) which are used to prompt providers when a patient is due for screening, and CRC screening performance measure scores have been identified as important interventions to promote CRC screening. However, CCRs may contribute to over-screening if they do not facilitate critical evaluation of appropriateness, and performance measures may contribute to overuse by encouraging indiscriminate screening practices. Aims. The objective of this research is to improve the quality of CRC screening programs by minimizing the number of patients who receive inappropriate screening tests while maintaining high rates of appropriate CRC screening. This grant will quantify the extent of inappropriate screening in a large integrated health care system. It will also test hypotheses regarding the association of inappropriate CRC screening rates with facility CRC screening performance measure scores and CCR characteristics (i.e., whether the CCR contains input fields to document a rationale for not recommending screening). Approach. This one-year observational study will begin by identifying patients who had a CRC screening test at any Veterans Health Administration facility (n=139) in fiscal year 2010. An algorithm, developed for this study, will be applied to the administrative data to classify each screening procedure as inappropriate or appropriate based on patient demographics, screening history, and health status. To reduce error associated with automated classification, a manual chart review on a subsample of 10 patients from each of 32 facilities will be conducted. Predictive modeling and multiple imputation techniques will then be used to identify predictors of misclassification and to reclassify cases from the full sample that are identified as likely to have been initially misclassified. Facility estimates of inappropriate screening obtained from these analyses will then be entered as dependent variables into hierarchical logistic regression models to test proposed hypotheses regarding the relationships between facility CCR characteristics, Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS)-based performance measure scores, and inappropriate CRC screening.          This project will quantify the extent of inappropriate colorectal cancer (CRC) screening within a large US healthcare system, examine relationships between inappropriate CRC screening and characteristics of facility CRC screening computerized clinical reminders, and test for an association between inappropriate screening and facility Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS)-based CRC screening performance measure scores. Through this work we expect to identify improvements to current CRC screening strategies that will reduce the number of unnecessary procedures conducted on patients who are unlikely to benefit, while still facilitating CRC screening for those who are screening appropriate.

"Mitochondria as a novel biomarker of colorectal adenoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although early detection and removal of colorectal adenomas, the precursors of most colorectal cancers, has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality due to colorectal cancer, the disease remains the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States. There is increasing evidence that oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. We recently found that increased circulating concentrations of oxidative stress biomarkers are associated with increased colorectal adenoma risk. Mitochondria (Mt) are the predominant source of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a major cause of endogenous oxidative stress. Mitochondrial variations (mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and mitochondrial polymorphisms) have been associated with increased ROS production. Despite the central role for mitochondria in ROS production, their role in pathogenesis of colorectal adenomas has not been evaluated. We hypothesize that mtDNA copy number and germline variations in the mitochondrial genome will be associated with colorectal adenoma risk. We propose to evaluate this hypothesis by measuring mtDNA copy number using real time polymerase chain reaction and genotyping mitochondrial tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) and D-loop polymorphisms in 392 colorectal adenoma cases and 565 controls collected from three methodologically very similar, colonoscopy-based case-control studies of incident, sporadic colorectal adenomas. We will use unconditional logistic regression to analyze the association between mtDNA copy number, mitochondrial polymorphisms and colorectal adenoma risk. This innovative epidemiologic study seeks to translate our understanding of mitochondrial biology into discovery of novel mitochondrial biomarkers that can inform strategies for the primary prevention of colorectal adenoma. Findings from this exploratory study will provide preliminary data to design a prospective study with adequate sample size to confirm the findings from this study and comprehensively evaluate the role of mitochondria in colorectal cancer etiology.          This application aims to evaluate the association between mitochondrial variants (mitochondrial DNA copy number and mitochondrial polymorphisms) and risk of colorectal adenoma is an existing dataset of 392 colorectal adenoma cases and 565 controls. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to further our understanding of the complex interactions between genetic and environmental/lifestyle factors that affect risk for incident, sporadic colorectal cancer.

"Development of a comprehensive model for colorectal cancer risk prediction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) varies widely across the population. Statistical models have shown that there must be wide variation in the underlying 'familial risk profile' necessary to explain the well-established familial risks of CRC. On top of this, CRC risk is determined by personal characteristics and exposures to many environmental factors. Current screening guidelines use only age and rudimentary metrics of family history to stratify individuals to different regimens. To date, there are no CRC risk prediction models that integrate data on family history (including ages, ages at diagnoses, and relationships across multiple generations) and all known genetic factors, let alone environmental factors and personal characteristics associated with CRC risk. Our goal is to develop a comprehensive risk prediction model that will deliver an accurate individual risk prediction across the full spectrum of risk by using explicit family history data, as well as data on the presence or absence of all known genetic and environmental risk factors. This model will facilitate more appropriate screening recommendations to reduce the burden of disease. We will do this using data from a fully characterized, population-based study with comprehensively measured known and suspected risk factors including personal characteristics, environmental risk factors, complex family history, and measured genetic variants. We have at our disposal the Colon Cancer Family Registry, a large, prospective, international resource of families and individuals who span the continuum of risk for CRC, recruited from the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand since 1998. Participants have: (i) been tested for mutations in the mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2) and MUTYH, and measured for the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) known to be associated with CRC; (ii) provided a multi-generational pedigree and family cancer history which has been validated where possible; and (iii) completed a risk factor questionnaire at baseline and every five years. We will accomplish our goal by addressing two aims. The first is to develop the CRC risk prediction model using measured genetic information, the multi-generational cancer family history data, and the information on all known risk factors. We will apply segregation analysis and logistic regression to data from 29,701 individuals from 12,902 population-based families. The second aim is to test the validity of the CRC risk prediction model and to determine its incremental value over existing models using prospective data. We will determine how well, in terms of calibration and predictive capacity, the model's predicted CRC risks (based on their baseline data) predict the CRC diagnoses occurring during the follow-up of the sub-cohort individuals with no history of CRC at baseline (19,390 with five-year follow-up of which 8,657 have 10-year follow-up).

"Integrated Genomic Discovery and Functional Validation of Colorectal Cancer Loci    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) arises from multiple mutations and genomic aberrations in distinct driver cancer genes that that in concert to spur neoplastic development and phenotype. This inherent genetic complexity greatly complicates both personalized diagnosis and treatment. Previously published studies have confined that large numbers of genes will be mutated or subject to genomic aberrations in CRC. A significant and emerging challenge for the post-genomic era is to identify which of these mutated genes are ""driver"" loci that functionally drive colon cancer development, versus ""passenger"" loci without functional relevance. Finally, it is of the highest priority that one forges these genetic observations with correlations of prognosis and clinical outcome. This can only be done if we better understand the unified biological ramifications of the combined and diverse multigenic driver background which act synergistically to promote CRC tumorigenesis. This proposal details an integrated analysis that will rely on the CRC genomic data generated by the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) to discover novel candidate CRC genes and study multigenic CRC driver gene co-mutated / dysregulated modules within the genetic context of other drivers and provide biological validation in a powerful in vitro primary culture CRC model which can be engineered for multiple genetic events.  To accomplish these goals, we will develop and implement novel statistical methodologies for the integrative analysis of multiple TCGA genomic and clinical data sets. The goal is to identify and prioritize novel CRC genes either singly or as co-mutated modules in combination with other known ""driver"" CRC genes. We will use the rich TCGA data set to conduct an integrated CRC genomic analysis of point mutations, gene expression, copy number aberrations and methylation data. We will prioritize the discovery of mutations and other genomic aberrations of these novel CRC genes that are associated with specific clinical stages of disease and other clinical parameters.  These statistical and computational studies will then be directly coupled to rapid and robust functional target validation of candidate loci using our rigorously characterized in vitro primary intestinal culture methodology (Gotani et al, Nature Medicine, 2009), in which we have recently established the transforming activity of established CRC loci such as APC, KRAS and TP53. Genetic deletion and retroviral expression of shRNA, cDNA or mutants thereof will be utilized to evaluate putative individual driver loci, as well as combinatorial oncogene modules. This proposal directly addresses fundamental problems in the exploration and translation of novel colorectal cancer gene discovery in the context of clinical data which is available from TCGA. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States. This proposal utilizes a fusion of genomic analysis of a large population of patients, mathematical modeling and culture of intestinal fragments to functionally identify genes that are critical for colon cancer development.

"miRNA and colorectal cancer: associations with tumor phenotype and survival     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a class of small regulatory RNAs that mediate post-transcriptional silencing of specific target mRNAs. Our overall hypotheses are that miRNA expression is unique to tumor molecular phenotype; that miRNA expression levels at time of diagnosis predicts survival; and that miRNA expression is associated with inflammation-related genetic and lifestyle factors key to colorectal cancer (CRC). This study takes a two pronged approach to addressing our hypotheses. While we propose to validate previously identified miRNAs that have been identified as associated with CRC (either by differential expression or from assessment of mutations), we will add to the field through discovery of new and important associations that may be unique to specific molecular phenotypes, to polyp to cancer progression, and to survival. We will analyze the expression of 866 human miRNAs using data derived from tumor and paired normal tissue at time of diagnosis from: 1660 people with incident colon cancer; 840 people with incident rectal cancer; and 350 polyps from our colon and rectal cases who reported a prior polyp; 5% of tumors, will be analyzed for quality control. Our total assessment will be on 5475 samples. We will extend the validation of previously identified mutated miRNAs and differentially expressed miRNAs to determine if these alterations are associated with specific tumor molecular phenotype, inflammation-related factors, clinical factors and survival. Important miRNAs will be validated using TaqMan-based assays. Associations will be tested based on differential expression for both individual and groups of miRNAs using recent extensions of several statistical methods including ANOVA, logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazards models. Our sample size allows for both a training and validation component, and provides sufficient statistical power to meet the study goals. MiRNAs that are differentially expressed in polyps and in subsequent tumors will provide new insights into targets for screening and treatment and differential miRNAs that function as the ""driver"" vs. the ""passenger"" in the carcinogenic process. Testing of mutated miRNAs identified from sequencing in conjunction with tumor phenotype, clinical, and survival data will further validate the importance of these miRNAs, and provide insight as to which CRC molecular pathway the miRNAs function. Our rich dataset of lifestyle, genetic, clinical and prognosis, and tumor molecular phenotype on 2500 CRC and paired normal tissue allows us to examine factors that are associated with miRNAs in a large set of population-based cases. The miRNAs identified in these analyses will elucidate pathways important in the etiology of CRC and will provide insight into potential targets for screening and treatment.

"Measurement of Inappropriate Screening Tests (MIST)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although routine screening can reduce colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality, some screened patients may not be appropriate for screening. We define inappropriate screening as screening at intervals that are shorter than recommended by guidelines, screening high-risk patients with a method other than colonoscopy, and screening when the patient is unlikely to benefit because they are under age 50 over age 85 or of have a life expectancy of less than 5 years. Inappropriate CRC screening strains scarce gastroenterology resources, increases costs of healthcare, and exposes patients to inconvenience, stress and medical risks, including death. Little is known about the prevalence of inappropriate screening beyond single site estimates. Nor do we know about inter-facility variation or its causes. Both computerized clinical reminders (CCRs) which are used to prompt providers when a patient is due for screening, and CRC screening performance measure scores have been identified as important interventions to promote CRC screening. However, CCRs may contribute to over-screening if they do not facilitate critical evaluation of appropriateness, and performance measures may contribute to overuse by encouraging indiscriminate screening practices. Aims. The objective of this research is to improve the quality of CRC screening programs by minimizing the number of patients who receive inappropriate screening tests while maintaining high rates of appropriate CRC screening. This grant will quantify the extent of inappropriate screening in a large integrated health care system. It will also test hypotheses regarding the association of inappropriate CRC screening rates with facility CRC screening performance measure scores and CCR characteristics (i.e., whether the CCR contains input fields to document a rationale for not recommending screening). Approach. This one-year observational study will begin by identifying patients who had a CRC screening test at any Veterans Health Administration facility (n=139) in fiscal year 2010. An algorithm, developed for this study, will be applied to the administrative data to classify each screening procedure as inappropriate or appropriate based on patient demographics, screening history, and health status. To reduce error associated with automated classification, a manual chart review on a subsample of 10 patients from each of 32 facilities will be conducted. Predictive modeling and multiple imputation techniques will then be used to identify predictors of misclassification and to reclassify cases from the full sample that are identified as likely to have been initially misclassified. Facility estimates of inappropriate screening obtained from these analyses will then be entered as dependent variables into hierarchical logistic regression models to test proposed hypotheses regarding the relationships between facility CCR characteristics, Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS)-based performance measure scores, and inappropriate CRC screening.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will quantify the extent of inappropriate colorectal cancer (CRC) screening within a large US healthcare system, examine relationships between inappropriate CRC screening and characteristics of facility CRC screening computerized clinical reminders, and test for an association between inappropriate screening and facility Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS)-based CRC screening performance measure scores. Through this work we expect to identify improvements to current CRC screening strategies that will reduce the number of unnecessary procedures conducted on patients who are unlikely to benefit, while still facilitating CRC screening for those who are screening appropriate.              This project will quantify the extent of inappropriate colorectal cancer (CRC) screening within a large US healthcare system, examine relationships between inappropriate CRC screening and characteristics of facility CRC screening computerized clinical reminders, and test for an association between inappropriate screening and facility Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS)-based CRC screening performance measure scores.

"Mitochondria as a novel biomarker of colorectal adenoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although early detection and removal of colorectal adenomas, the precursors of most colorectal cancers, has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality due to colorectal cancer, the disease remains the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States. There is increasing evidence that oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. We recently found that increased circulating concentrations of oxidative stress biomarkers are associated with increased colorectal adenoma risk. Mitochondria (Mt) are the predominant source of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a major cause of endogenous oxidative stress. Mitochondrial variations (mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and mitochondrial polymorphisms) have been associated with increased ROS production. Despite the central role for mitochondria in ROS production, their role in pathogenesis of colorectal adenomas has not been evaluated. We hypothesize that mtDNA copy number and germline variations in the mitochondrial genome will be associated with colorectal adenoma risk. We propose to evaluate this hypothesis by measuring mtDNA copy number using real time polymerase chain reaction and genotyping mitochondrial tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) and D-loop polymorphisms in 392 colorectal adenoma cases and 565 controls collected from three methodologically very similar, colonoscopy-based case-control studies of incident, sporadic colorectal adenomas. We will use unconditional logistic regression to analyze the association between mtDNA copy number, mitochondrial polymorphisms and colorectal adenoma risk. This innovative epidemiologic study seeks to translate our understanding of mitochondrial biology into discovery of novel mitochondrial biomarkers that can inform strategies for the primary prevention of colorectal adenoma. Findings from this exploratory study will provide preliminary data to design a prospective study with adequate sample size to confirm the findings from this study and comprehensively evaluate the role of mitochondria in colorectal cancer etiology.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application aims to evaluate the association between mitochondrial variants (mitochondrial DNA copy number and mitochondrial polymorphisms) and risk of colorectal adenoma is an existing dataset of 392 colorectal adenoma cases and 565 controls.

"Genetic risk factors in African American colorectal cancer patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a serious public health problem that affects African Americans (AA) disproportionately. Both incidence rates and morbidity and mortality is higher in AAs than in other Americans. Family history, that is, genetic risk, remains one of the most important factors in recommendations for screening. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified 10 independent regions harboring genetic risk factors in CRC in populations of European ancestry. Using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from these studies, we have obtained evidence of association in four of these regions in AA CRC. Our goal is to identify the functional genetic risk factors, quantify their effects, and determine their functions. To pursue this goal, we propose four Aims. (1) We will validate previously identified candidate CRC-associated regions in AA CRC cases and controls. We will use Sequenom genotyping and tag SNPs from these regions to identify SNPs associated with CRC in AAs. We will use 100 ancestry informative markers to perform a structured logistic regression analysis that takes into account possible population stratification based on ancestry. Because AAs are more diverse than European Americans, these studies will very likely lead to better localization of the genetic risk factors. (2) We will use Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology to conduct a resequencing analysis of each candidate genetic region in 96 (48 CRC and 48 controls) persons with CRC. The region that we resequence will be guided by the genes and linkage disequilibrium observed in each CRC-associated region. (3) We will better quantify the effects of the genetic risk factors in each region. We will perform a bioinformatics analysis to identify putative functional variants. These functional candidates along with our novel genetic variants in CRC-associated regions will be genotyped in up to 2000 AA cases and 2000 AA control. We will perform structured logistic regression analysis to obtain the strongest genotype relative risks in each CRC-associated regions. (4) The foregoing analyses will provide a short-list of candidate genetic risk factors for each CRC-associated region. We will begin to characterize the molecular basis of CRC risk for each region by functional assays designed based on the putative mechanism caused by the genetic variants (regulatory or enzymatic). Molecular assays (for example, luciferase reporter assays) will be designed to determine the functional impact of candidate genetic risk factors.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer affects African Americans disproportionately relative to other Americans. The discovery of genetic risk factors associated with colorectal cancer predisposition is tantamount to a fundamental understanding of the etiology of this significant health problem and to recommendations for cancer screening. We have found several candidate regions that contain genetic risk factors in African Americans.

"Reducing disparities in colorectal cancer screening in Vietnamese Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in Vietnamese Americans are lower than those in non-Hispanic whites. Consistent with our long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer, we propose to disseminate an evidence-based lay health worker (LHW) intervention supported by a media campaign (Media) to increase CRC screening in this poor and medically underserved population. We will use the Pathways Framework, Community-Based Participatory Research process, and Diffusion of Innovations Theory to guide our approach to the intervention, community participation, and dissemination. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of a CRC LHW + Media intervention in increasing CRC screening among Vietnamese Americans aged 50 to 74 who have never had a CRC screening test, 2) identify predictors of CRC screening, and 3) evaluate the process of community participation. Following formative research using a cognitive testing approach to develop culturally and linguistically appropriate health education materials and survey instruments, we will conduct a cluster randomized trial among Vietnamese Americans aged 50-74 in Santa Clara County California, who have never had a CRC screening test prior to recruitment. We will follow two longitudinal cohorts among whom we will conduct a pre-intervention survey of participants' knowledge, intention, and behavior as regards CRC screening; implement CRC screening educational sessions in an experimental group and nutrition educational sessions in a comparison group; and conduct a post-intervention survey. Each of the two cohorts will include 150 men and 150 women to have a total sample size of 600. The media intervention component will distribute Vietnamese-language health education materials through print and electronic media. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by comparing the frequency of screening using pre- and post-intervention surveys. To test our primary hypothesis regarding the effects of the intervention on screening activity, we will use Z-tests. We will also employ logistic regression models to test the effects of the intervention and to identify predictors for CRC screening. In addition, we will conduct process evaluation of the intervention and community participation. If this intervention is found to be effective, this LHW model could be applied in health promotion programs to further reduce disparities in CRC screening in Vietnamese Americans and evaluated in other behavioral objectives and settings to reduce health disparities in other poor and underserved populations. n/a",Reducing disparities in colorectal cancer screening in Vietnamese Americans,8212393,R01CA132660,"['Adopted', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birds', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cognitive', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Community Participation', 'County', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electronics', 'Evaluation', 'Familiarity', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health education', 'Hearing', 'Immigrant', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Media Campaign', 'Media Intervention', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Sigmoidoscopy', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Translating', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'community intervention', 'community organizations', 'comparison group', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention effect', 'male', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'medically underserved', 'medically underserved population', 'men', 'mortality', 'nutrition', 'post intervention', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'randomized trial', 'theories']",NCI,CANCER PREVENTION INSTIT OF CALIFORNIA,R01,2012,540344,0,0.31923854986366673
"Integrated Genomic Discovery and Functional Validation of Colorectal Cancer Loci    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) arises from multiple mutations and genomic aberrations in distinct driver cancer genes that that in concert to spur neoplastic development and phenotype. This inherent genetic complexity greatly complicates both personalized diagnosis and treatment. Previously published studies have confined that large numbers of genes will be mutated or subject to genomic aberrations in CRC. A significant and emerging challenge for the post-genomic era is to identify which of these mutated genes are ""driver"" loci that functionally drive colon cancer development, versus ""passenger"" loci without functional relevance. Finally, it is of the highest priority that one forges these genetic observations with correlations of prognosis and clinical outcome. This can only be done if we better understand the unified biological ramifications of the combined and diverse multigenic driver background which act synergistically to promote CRC tumorigenesis. This proposal details an integrated analysis that will rely on the CRC genomic data generated by the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) to discover novel candidate CRC genes and study multigenic CRC driver gene co-mutated / dysregulated modules within the genetic context of other drivers and provide biological validation in a powerful in vitro primary culture CRC model which can be engineered for multiple genetic events.  To accomplish these goals, we will develop and implement novel statistical methodologies for the integrative analysis of multiple TCGA genomic and clinical data sets. The goal is to identify and prioritize novel CRC genes either singly or as co-mutated modules in combination with other known ""driver"" CRC genes. We will use the rich TCGA data set to conduct an integrated CRC genomic analysis of point mutations, gene expression, copy number aberrations and methylation data. We will prioritize the discovery of mutations and other genomic aberrations of these novel CRC genes that are associated with specific clinical stages of disease and other clinical parameters.  These statistical and computational studies will then be directly coupled to rapid and robust functional target validation of candidate loci using our rigorously characterized in vitro primary intestinal culture methodology (Gotani et al, Nature Medicine, 2009), in which we have recently established the transforming activity of established CRC loci such as APC, KRAS and TP53. Genetic deletion and retroviral expression of shRNA, cDNA or mutants thereof will be utilized to evaluate putative individual driver loci, as well as combinatorial oncogene modules. This proposal directly addresses fundamental problems in the exploration and translation of novel colorectal cancer gene discovery in the context of clinical data which is available from TCGA. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States. This proposal utilizes a fusion of genomic analysis of a large population of patients, mathematical modeling and culture of intestinal fragments to functionally identify genes that are critical for colon cancer development.

"miRNA and colorectal cancer: associations with tumor phenotype and survival     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a class of small regulatory RNAs that mediate post-transcriptional silencing of specific target mRNAs. Our overall hypotheses are that miRNA expression is unique to tumor molecular phenotype; that miRNA expression levels at time of diagnosis predicts survival; and that miRNA expression is associated with inflammation-related genetic and lifestyle factors key to colorectal cancer (CRC). This study takes a two pronged approach to addressing our hypotheses. While we propose to validate previously identified miRNAs that have been identified as associated with CRC (either by differential expression or from assessment of mutations), we will add to the field through discovery of new and important associations that may be unique to specific molecular phenotypes, to polyp to cancer progression, and to survival. We will analyze the expression of 866 human miRNAs using data derived from tumor and paired normal tissue at time of diagnosis from: 1660 people with incident colon cancer; 840 people with incident rectal cancer; and 350 polyps from our colon and rectal cases who reported a prior polyp; 5% of tumors, will be analyzed for quality control. Our total assessment will be on 5475 samples. We will extend the validation of previously identified mutated miRNAs and differentially expressed miRNAs to determine if these alterations are associated with specific tumor molecular phenotype, inflammation-related factors, clinical factors and survival. Important miRNAs will be validated using TaqMan-based assays. Associations will be tested based on differential expression for both individual and groups of miRNAs using recent extensions of several statistical methods including ANOVA, logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazards models. Our sample size allows for both a training and validation component, and provides sufficient statistical power to meet the study goals. MiRNAs that are differentially expressed in polyps and in subsequent tumors will provide new insights into targets for screening and treatment and differential miRNAs that function as the ""driver"" vs. the ""passenger"" in the carcinogenic process. Testing of mutated miRNAs identified from sequencing in conjunction with tumor phenotype, clinical, and survival data will further validate the importance of these miRNAs, and provide insight as to which CRC molecular pathway the miRNAs function. Our rich dataset of lifestyle, genetic, clinical and prognosis, and tumor molecular phenotype on 2500 CRC and paired normal tissue allows us to examine factors that are associated with miRNAs in a large set of population-based cases. The miRNAs identified in these analyses will elucidate pathways important in the etiology of CRC and will provide insight into potential targets for screening and treatment.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our rich dataset of lifestyle, genetic, clinical and prognosis, and tumor molecular phenotype on 2500 CRC (colorectal cancer) and paired normal tissue allows us to examine factors that are associated with miRNA expression and mutation in a large sample of population-based cases.

"Genetic risk factors in African American colorectal cancer patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a serious public health problem that affects African Americans (AA) disproportionately. Both incidence rates and morbidity and mortality is higher in AAs than in other Americans. Family history, that is, genetic risk, remains one of the most important factors in recommendations for screening. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified 10 independent regions harboring genetic risk factors in CRC in populations of European ancestry. Using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from these studies, we have obtained evidence of association in four of these regions in AA CRC. Our goal is to identify the functional genetic risk factors, quantify their effects, and determine their functions. To pursue this goal, we propose four Aims. (1) We will validate previously identified candidate CRC-associated regions in AA CRC cases and controls. We will use Sequenom genotyping and tag SNPs from these regions to identify SNPs associated with CRC in AAs. We will use 100 ancestry informative markers to perform a structured logistic regression analysis that takes into account possible population stratification based on ancestry. Because AAs are more diverse than European Americans, these studies will very likely lead to better localization of the genetic risk factors. (2) We will use Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology to conduct a resequencing analysis of each candidate genetic region in 96 (48 CRC and 48 controls) persons with CRC. The region that we resequence will be guided by the genes and linkage disequilibrium observed in each CRC-associated region. (3) We will better quantify the effects of the genetic risk factors in each region. We will perform a bioinformatics analysis to identify putative functional variants. These functional candidates along with our novel genetic variants in CRC-associated regions will be genotyped in up to 2000 AA cases and 2000 AA control. We will perform structured logistic regression analysis to obtain the strongest genotype relative risks in each CRC-associated regions. (4) The foregoing analyses will provide a short-list of candidate genetic risk factors for each CRC-associated region. We will begin to characterize the molecular basis of CRC risk for each region by functional assays designed based on the putative mechanism caused by the genetic variants (regulatory or enzymatic). Molecular assays (for example, luciferase reporter assays) will be designed to determine the functional impact of candidate genetic risk factors.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer affects African Americans disproportionately relative to other Americans. The discovery of genetic risk factors associated with colorectal cancer predisposition is tantamount to a fundamental understanding of the etiology of this significant health problem and to recommendations for cancer screening.

These and other regions have been implicated in colorectal cancer risk by validated genetic associations.

"Serum Biomarkers for Colorectal Cancer Detection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  When cancer is identified at the earliest stages, cancer survival rates dramatically increase and therefore diagnostic screening tests that can detect early stage cancer are crucial. The overall goal of our research is to develop such an early detection screening test. We intend to prospectively accrue a large well-defined independent cohort of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases where we collect extensive data on this cohort at the time of diagnosis. We will generate a comprehensive database that includes data on demographics, personal and family history, tumor characteristics, and comorbidities. Our preliminary research efforts have been to develop a detection assay utilizing the sera of our discovery cohort of CRC patients and healthy controls. We have developed a high throughput method to isolated cDNA clones of antigens which can be used to identify cancer cases by detecting the presence of auto-antibodies to tumor proteins in the serum of the test subject. Our first aim is to identify the minimal number of antigen clones that are critical in distinguishing sera from patients with colorectal cancer from healthy controls utilizing our initial discovery cohort. We will eliminate antigen clones from our discovery set of 3800 clones that react with sera from patients with other cancers, benign gastrointestinal conditions, duplicates or do not react with any CRC sera. Our second aim is to determine the test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy) on these newly selected antigen markers for distinguishing colorectal cancer cases using newly acquired sera samples not previously used in the development of the marker set. Lastly, we intend to determine the test characteristics of these antigen markers on a large independent well-defined cohort of colorectal cancer patients and healthy controls. In addition, due to the size, racial/ethnic makeup of the study population, and captured patient data, we will be able to evaluate the expression of these markers in relationship to important subgroups.              Project Narrative The significance of this work is to develop an assay that can identify cancerous and pre-cancerous conditions in patients before the onset of clinical symptoms.

We will perform structured logistic regression analysis to obtain the strongest genotype relative risks in each CRC-associated regions. (4) The foregoing analyses will provide a short-list of candidate genetic risk factors for each CRC-associated region. We will begin to characterize the molecular basis of CRC risk for each region by functional assays designed based on the putative mechanism caused by the genetic variants (regulatory or enzymatic). Molecular assays (for example, luciferase reporter assays) will be designed to determine the functional impact of candidate genetic risk factors.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer affects African Americans disproportionately relative to other Americans. The discovery of genetic risk factors associated with colorectal cancer predisposition is tantamount to a fundamental understanding of the etiology of this significant health problem and to recommendations for cancer screening. We have found several candidate regions that contain genetic risk factors in African Americans. These and other regions have been implicated in colorectal cancer risk by validated genetic associations. We will determine the functional genetic variants that increase risk by genetic and functional studies. These studies will have important implications for early detection and possibly therapeutic intervention among African Americans.          n/a",Genetic risk factors in African American colorectal cancer patients,7993187,U01CA153060,"['15q23', '8q24', 'Accounting', 'Affect', 'African American', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell model', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'DNA Resequencing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Factor Analysis', 'Family history of', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Lead', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Luciferases', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Regression Analysis', 'Relative (related person)', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporter', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'case control', 'design', 'gene function', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'in vitro Assay', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'validation studies']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,U01,2010,376931,148463823,0.2344434291694181
"Promoting Colon Cancer Screening Among African Amercians Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, affecting both men and women of all racial and ethnic groups. The majority of these deaths could be prevented since CRC, when discovered early, is highly treatable and screening that leads to removal of adenomatous polyps decreases CRC incidence by 75% to 90%. Nationally, in 2002, only 50% of adults aged 50 or older reported having had any screening test in the recommended intervals. Both CRC incidence and mortality rates are higher among African Americans than any other racial group. These health disparities are due, in part, to delay in diagnosis resulting in advanced stage disease at presentation. Lower rates of CRC screening participation among African Americans contribute to this burden. Interactive computer-based interventions effectively promote health behavior change by delivering individualized, or tailored, health information and counseling. In pilot testing, a tailored, interactive computer intervention designed to promote CRC screening among African Americans resulted in increased CRC knowledge and higher rates of fecal occult blood testing. The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of a tailored, interactive computer intervention to promote CRC screening by comparing it to, and combining it with, a physician recommendation, which has been found to be a significant predictor of CRC screening. A sample of 1248 African American men and women who are being seen in two Midwestern primary care networks and who are non-adherent to colon cancer screening guidelines will be randomly assigned to receive either: 1) a CRC screening brochure; 2) an interactive computer intervention; or 3) the interactive computer intervention plus the brochure. Both process and outcome variables will be examined. Rates of adherence to fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy are primary outcomes examined at 6 and 15 months. Logistic regression models will be used to test intervention effects separately for two outcomes, fecal occult blood testing (initial and repeat) and endoscopic screening, while adjusting for potentially confounding covariates. Mediators and moderators of intervention effects and changes in health beliefs related to the interventions also will be determined.         n/a",Promoting Colon Cancer Screening Among African Amercians,7825479,R01CA115983,"['Address', 'Adenomatous Polyps', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African', 'African American', 'Age', 'American Cancer Society', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Colon', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Excision', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior change', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicare', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Progress Review Group', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sigmoidoscopy', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'effective intervention', 'group intervention', 'health belief', 'health disparity', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'intervention effect', 'men', 'minority health', 'mortality', 'population based', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'response', 'therapy design', 'uptake']",NCI,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2010,389993,232986943,0.3046843399904394
"Reducing disparities in colorectal cancer screening in Vietnamese Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in Vietnamese Americans are lower than those in non-Hispanic whites. Consistent with our long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer, we propose to disseminate an evidence-based lay health worker (LHW) intervention supported by a media campaign (Media) to increase CRC screening in this poor and medically underserved population. We will use the Pathways Framework, Community-Based Participatory Research process, and Diffusion of Innovations Theory to guide our approach to the intervention, community participation, and dissemination. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of a CRC LHW + Media intervention in increasing CRC screening among Vietnamese Americans aged 50 to 74 who have never had a CRC screening test, 2) identify predictors of CRC screening, and 3) evaluate the process of community participation. Following formative research using a cognitive testing approach to develop culturally and linguistically appropriate health education materials and survey instruments, we will conduct a cluster randomized trial among Vietnamese Americans aged 50-74 in Santa Clara County California, who have never had a CRC screening test prior to recruitment. We will follow two longitudinal cohorts among whom we will conduct a pre-intervention survey of participants' knowledge, intention, and behavior as regards CRC screening; implement CRC screening educational sessions in an experimental group and nutrition educational sessions in a comparison group; and conduct a post-intervention survey. Each of the two cohorts will include 150 men and 150 women to have a total sample size of 600. The media intervention component will distribute Vietnamese-language health education materials through print and electronic media. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by comparing the frequency of screening using pre- and post-intervention surveys. To test our primary hypothesis regarding the effects of the intervention on screening activity, we will use Z-tests. We will also employ logistic regression models to test the effects of the intervention and to identify predictors for CRC screening. In addition, we will conduct process evaluation of the intervention and community participation. If this intervention is found to be effective, this LHW model could be applied in health promotion programs to further reduce disparities in CRC screening in Vietnamese Americans and evaluated in other behavioral objectives and settings to reduce health disparities in other poor and underserved populations. Public Health Relevance: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in Vietnamese Americans are lower than those in non-Hispanic whites. Relative to non-Hispanic whites, Vietnamese Americans are both poorer and less well medically served and have special language and cultural issues related to cancer screening that cannot be addressed though interventions aimed at the general population. Consistent with our long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer, we propose to disseminate an evidence-based lay health worker (LHW) intervention supported by a media campaign (Media) to increase CRC screening in this poor and medically underserved population. If this intervention is found to be effective, it could be applied in other health promotion programs throughout the United States  to further reduce disparities in CRC screening in Vietnamese Americans. In addition, this LHW model could be evaluated in other populations, such as other racial and ethnic, poor, or immigrant communities; in other behavioral objectives, such as other forms of cancer, cardiovascular health, or tobacco, diabetes and obesity control; and in other settings, such as community health clinics and hospitals.",Reducing disparities in colorectal cancer screening in Vietnamese Americans,7766896,R01CA132660,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Age', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birds', 'Breast', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cognitive', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Community Participation', 'County', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electronics', 'Evaluation', 'Familiarity', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health education', 'Hearing', 'Immigrant', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Media Campaign', 'Media Intervention', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Sigmoidoscopy', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Translating', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'community intervention', 'community organizations', 'comparison group', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention effect', 'male', 'medically underserved', 'medically underserved population', 'men', 'mortality', 'nutrition', 'post intervention', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'racial and ethnic', 'randomized trial', 'theories']",NCI,CANCER PREVENTION INSTIT OF CALIFORNIA,R01,2010,577046,0,0.31896776542556393
"Mammography Visits to Improve Colon Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overall goal: to explore behavioral correlations between colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and screening mammography and develop an innovative approach for reducing barriers to CRC screening in women, using screening mammography, an existing non-colon cancer related screening test that has widespread public acceptance, as a ""teachable moment (TM).""  This study will be the first prospective study to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational intervention designed to increase CRC screening administered at a cancer screening visit unrelated to CRC. Specific alms: 1) To evaluate screening mammography as a setting (or ""teachable moment"") for administering CRC education; 2) To identify psychosocial barriers to colorectal cancer screening in women undergoing screening mammography; Aim 1 includes two separate randomized clinical trials to evaluate the effect of a CRC educational video on CRC screening adherence in women (aims 1A/1B) and an observational study evaluating screening mammography as a TM.  Aim 1A tests the efficacy of the CRC educational video intervention when administered during a screening mammography appointment.  Aim 1B tests the efficacy of the CRC educational video intervention when administered during a general medicine clinic visit.  Aim 1C tests the moderator effect of screening mammography on the effect of the educational intervention on CRC adherence using a quasi-experimental design by comparing the group receiving the CRC education intervention during screening mammography and the group who receive the same intervention during a noncancer screening-related clinic visit.  The primary outcome for aim 1 is the proportion of women due for CRC screening who complete screening within 6 months of the intervention.  Aim 2 uses survey methods to identify psychosocial barriers to CRC screening, based on the integrated TM-preventive health model.  A questionnaire will be prospectively administered to the participants prior to and immediately after the educational intervention.  Baseline information elicited from the study questionnaire and demographic characteristics will be used as independent variables in a series of multivariable analyses to assess the impact of each predictor on the non-adherence to CRC screening.  Predictor variables achieving statistical significance in the bivariate analyses (p<0.05) of non-adherence status and each of the potential predictor variables will be entered into a logistic model to determine independent variables associated with non-adherence to CRC screening. Forward stepwise logistic regression analysis will be used to determine factors predictive of non-adherence to any CRC screening strategy.  The project culminates in development and submission of an R-01 grant for development and testing of tailored messages directed at barriers identified in aim 2 and the development, testing and evaluation of a tailored education intervention to be delivered in a ""teachable moment"".             n/a",Mammography Visits to Improve Colon Cancer Screening,7619982,K07CA108664,"['Adherence', 'American', 'American Cancer Society', 'Appointment', 'Awareness', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic Visits', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Experimental Designs', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Incidence', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Logistic Models', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Mammography', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Prospective Studies', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Regression Analysis', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'cancer education', 'cancer risk', 'career', 'career development', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'disease natural history', 'efficacy testing', 'evaluation/testing', 'health care delivery', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'point of care', 'primary outcome', 'psychosocial', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'transmission process']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K07,2009,136080,641965656,0.3049787377330609
"Adherence and the Economics of Colon Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Objectives: In environments with limited economic resources, it is paramount that the cost-effectiveness of competing strategies of management be compared. Our previous work illustrates that the cost-effectiveness of screening to decrease mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC) depends heavily on adherence, and specifically on whether adherence between screening strategies is heterogeneous. The objectives of this study are to: 1. Determine whether there exists heterogeneity in adherence between different CRC screening tests, 2. Utilize prospective rates of adherence to calculate the true incremental cost-effectiveness between competing CRC screening strategies, 3. Identify factors associated with non-adherence to screening. Research Design: Prospective cohort study in which subjects' adherence to CRC screening tests scheduled by their primary care provider (PCP) is measured. Strategies to be evaluated include fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS), colonoscopy, and virtual colonoscopy (VC, when approved for CRC screening). A study survey based on constructs of the Health Belief Model will be administered. Population to be Studied: Patients at average risk for development of CRC. Principal Source of Data: The primary outcome is adherence to CRC screening, defined as completion of the screening strategy scheduled for the subject within 12-months of enrollment, verified through computerized medical records and subject contact. Secondary outcomes include assessment of preventive intention, measured by subject scheduling of CRC tests, calculation of the incremental cost-effectiveness between competing strategies of CRC screening, and identification of survey and demographic items associated with non-adherence to CRC screening. Principal Types of Analysis: Specific objective 1 will compare adherence to FOBT, FS, colonoscopy, and VC. Specific objective 2 will calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio between competing CRC screening strategies incorporating the prospectively derived adherence rates. Specific objective 3 will examine the association between potential predictive factors identified from the study survey and non-adherence to CRC screening. Analytic methods will include Chi-square testing of proportions, linear mixed-effects modeling and logistic regression analysis. PCPs will be examined as random- and fixed-effects in separate models to account for potential clustering of outcomes within PCP practices. Cost-effectiveness analysis will use our published decision analytic models. Public Health: This study will compare adherence to competing screening tests in order to identify the most cost-effectiveness strategy to decrease mortality from CRC.

"Serum Biomarkers for Colorectal Cancer Detection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  When cancer is identified at the earliest stages, cancer survival rates dramatically increase and therefore diagnostic screening tests that can detect early stage cancer are crucial. The overall goal of our research is to develop such an early detection screening test. We intend to prospectively accrue a large well-defined independent cohort of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases where we collect extensive data on this cohort at the time of diagnosis. We will generate a comprehensive database that includes data on demographics, personal and family history, tumor characteristics, and comorbidities. Our preliminary research efforts have been to develop a detection assay utilizing the sera of our discovery cohort of CRC patients and healthy controls. We have developed a high throughput method to isolated cDNA clones of antigens which can be used to identify cancer cases by detecting the presence of auto-antibodies to tumor proteins in the serum of the test subject. Our first aim is to identify the minimal number of antigen clones that are critical in distinguishing sera from patients with colorectal cancer from healthy controls utilizing our initial discovery cohort. We will eliminate antigen clones from our discovery set of 3800 clones that react with sera from patients with other cancers, benign gastrointestinal conditions, duplicates or do not react with any CRC sera. Our second aim is to determine the test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy) on these newly selected antigen markers for distinguishing colorectal cancer cases using newly acquired sera samples not previously used in the development of the marker set. Lastly, we intend to determine the test characteristics of these antigen markers on a large independent well-defined cohort of colorectal cancer patients and healthy controls. In addition, due to the size, racial/ethnic makeup of the study population, and captured patient data, we will be able to evaluate the expression of these markers in relationship to important subgroups.              Project Narrative The significance of this work is to develop an assay that can identify cancerous and pre-cancerous conditions in patients before the onset of clinical symptoms. Current technologies have been disappointing and have not resulted in diagnostic tests sufficiently reliable to apply to clinical practice in the detection of colon cancer. The focus of this work is to utilized new technology develop in our laboratory to define a non-invasive blood test applicable to early detection, diagnosis and/or screening of patients and permit preventive strategies, differential treatment and/or therapeutic targeting.",Serum Biomarkers for Colorectal Cancer Detection,7586435,R21CA132723,"['Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Benign', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood Tests', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancerous', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Comorbidity', 'Complementary DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Family history of', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Non-Malignant', 'Patients', 'Population Study', 'Prevention strategy', 'Printing', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'gastrointestinal', 'improved', 'new technology', 'racial and ethnic', 'therapeutic target', 'tumor']",NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2009,211859,59298088,0.09298195907051905

"Promoting Colon Cancer Screening Among African Americans Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, affecting both men and women of all racial and ethnic groups. The majority of these deaths could be prevented since CRC, when discovered early, is highly treatable and screening that leads to removal of adenomatous polyps decreases CRC incidence by 75% to 90%. Nationally, in 2002, only 50% of adults aged 50 or older reported having had any screening test in the recommended intervals. Both CRC incidence and mortality rates are higher among African Americans than any other racial group. These health disparities are due, in part, to delay in diagnosis resulting in advanced stage disease at presentation. Lower rates of CRC screening participation among African Americans contribute to this burden. Interactive computer-based interventions effectively promote health behavior change by delivering individualized, or tailored, health information and counseling. In pilot testing, a tailored, interactive computer intervention designed to promote CRC screening among African Americans resulted in increased CRC knowledge and higher rates of fecal occult blood testing. The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of a tailored, interactive computer intervention to promote CRC screening by comparing it to, and combining it with, a physician recommendation, which has been found to be a significant predictor of CRC screening. A sample of 1248 African American men and women who are being seen in two Midwestern primary care networks and who are non-adherent to colon cancer screening guidelines will be randomly assigned to receive either: 1) a CRC screening brochure; 2) an interactive computer intervention; or 3) the interactive computer intervention plus the brochure. Both process and outcome variables will be examined. Rates of adherence to fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy are primary outcomes examined at 6 and 15 months. Logistic regression models will be used to test intervention effects separately for two outcomes, fecal occult blood testing (initial and repeat) and endoscopic screening, while adjusting for potentially confounding covariates. Mediators and moderators of intervention effects and changes in health beliefs related to the interventions also will be determined.         n/a",Promoting Colon Cancer Screening Among African Americans,7617157,R01CA115983,"['Address', 'Adenomatous Polyps', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'American Cancer Society', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Colon', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Excision', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior change', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicare', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Progress Review Group', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sigmoidoscopy', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'effective intervention', 'group intervention', 'health belief', 'health disparity', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'intervention effect', 'men', 'minority health', 'mortality', 'population based', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'response', 'therapy design', 'uptake']",NCI,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2009,448552,232986943,0.30245783017761446
"Reducing disparities in colorectal cancer screening in Vietnamese Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in Vietnamese Americans are lower than those in non-Hispanic whites. Consistent with our long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer, we propose to disseminate an evidence-based lay health worker (LHW) intervention supported by a media campaign (Media) to increase CRC screening in this poor and medically underserved population. We will use the Pathways Framework, Community-Based Participatory Research process, and Diffusion of Innovations Theory to guide our approach to the intervention, community participation, and dissemination. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of a CRC LHW + Media intervention in increasing CRC screening among Vietnamese Americans aged 50 to 74 who have never had a CRC screening test, 2) identify predictors of CRC screening, and 3) evaluate the process of community participation. Following formative research using a cognitive testing approach to develop culturally and linguistically appropriate health education materials and survey instruments, we will conduct a cluster randomized trial among Vietnamese Americans aged 50-74 in Santa Clara County California, who have never had a CRC screening test prior to recruitment. We will follow two longitudinal cohorts among whom we will conduct a pre-intervention survey of participants' knowledge, intention, and behavior as regards CRC screening; implement CRC screening educational sessions in an experimental group and nutrition educational sessions in a comparison group; and conduct a post-intervention survey. Each of the two cohorts will include 150 men and 150 women to have a total sample size of 600. The media intervention component will distribute Vietnamese-language health education materials through print and electronic media. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by comparing the frequency of screening using pre- and post-intervention surveys. To test our primary hypothesis regarding the effects of the intervention on screening activity, we will use Z-tests. We will also employ logistic regression models to test the effects of the intervention and to identify predictors for CRC screening. In addition, we will conduct process evaluation of the intervention and community participation. If this intervention is found to be effective, this LHW model could be applied in health promotion programs to further reduce disparities in CRC screening in Vietnamese Americans and evaluated in other behavioral objectives and settings to reduce health disparities in other poor and underserved populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in Vietnamese Americans are lower than those in non-Hispanic whites. Relative to non-Hispanic whites, Vietnamese Americans are both poorer and less well medically served and have special language and cultural issues related to cancer screening that cannot be addressed though interventions aimed at the general population. Consistent with our long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer, we propose to disseminate an evidence-based lay health worker (LHW) intervention supported by a media campaign (Media) to increase CRC screening in this poor and medically underserved population. If this intervention is found to be effective, it could be applied in other health promotion programs throughout the United States to further reduce disparities in CRC screening in Vietnamese Americans. In addition, this LHW model could be evaluated in other populations, such as other racial and ethnic, poor, or immigrant communities; in other behavioral objectives, such as other forms of cancer, cardiovascular health, or tobacco, diabetes and obesity control; and in other settings, such as community health clinics and hospitals.

"Genetic Association Study in African-American Colorectal Cancer Patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant cause of cancer morbidity and mortality in the US. Determining who is at higher risk is especially important in CRC because screening tests are available that are proven to reduce death. Risk of CRC development is due to both hereditary and environmental factors which are not uniformly shared between all populations. To date, the field of CRC genetics has focused largely on Caucasian populations, while few studies have included African-American (AA) patients. Determining risk factors in AAs is an especially important goal because both incidence and mortality in this population are not decreasing as they are in all other US populations. At the University of Chicago, we are uniquely equipped to address genetic factors in AAs because we have assembled a large AA CRC case-control series. The main purpose of this study is to identify CRC-susceptibility alleles using a candidate gene screen approach and test for association in AA CRC patients and controls. CRC is particularly amenable to candidate gene studies because biologically relevant pathways have been identified in hereditary CRC syndromes and in the analysis of carcinogenesis in the adenoma to carcinoma sequence. The base excision repair pathway is especially interesting because recent work has elucidated a recessive polyposis syndrome associated with mutations in the gene MYH. Thus, genes involved in this pathway are biologically plausible candidates for harboring CRC-susceptibility alleles, but they have not been adequately identified or characterized in AAs to date. Our hypothesis is that novel susceptibility alleles in base-excision repair genes contribute to risk of CRC development in African-Americans. To test this hypothesis, we will screen candidate base-excision repair genes using high throughput heteroduplex analysis and use sequencing to characterize DNA changes (Specific Aim 1). To control for population stratification in our admixed AA population, we will determine individual ancestry estimates using a set of high informative ancestry informative markers (Specific Aim 2). Finally, we will genotype our putative CRC-susceptibility alleles identified in our candidate gene screens in a series of 400 AA CRC cases and 400 controls and then test for association by logistic regression (Specific Aim 3). With improved understanding of individual risk and proper screening, colorectal cancer is largely a preventable disease. The goal of our study is to better understand hereditary factors that increase risk especially in African-Americans who have the highest incidence and death from this cancer.           n/a",Genetic Association Study in African-American Colorectal Cancer Patients,7531036,F32CA132493,"['Address', 'African American', 'Alleles', 'Base Excision Repairs', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Carcinoma', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cessation of life', 'Chicago', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heteroduplex Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Predisposition', 'Purpose', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Stratification', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'cancer genetics', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'gene repair', 'genetic association', 'improved', 'interest', 'mortality', 'novel', 'polyposis']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F32,2008,12818,246330700,0.2704803669414655
"Identifying Receipt of Colorectal Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Regular screening for CRC leads to early detection and a substantial reduction in CRC-related morbidity and mortality. Despite this evidence, adherence to CRC screening recommendations remains poor. Given the benefits of screening for CRC, interventions need to be developed that will ultimately increase its utilization. These interventions must be targeted towards individuals who have never been screened or are not current with their screening, and must take into account risk factors [e.g., family history, inflammatory bowel disease, history of previous adenomas]. A significant barrier to applying CRC screening interventions is the ability to accurately and quickly identify patients in need of screening. In our proposed project, we will create and evaluate an innovative electronic data collection system to enhance our understanding of the delivery and utilization of CRC screening. We will use as a test site the primary care clinics affiliated with Vanderbilt University Medical Center, but the approach developed will be general enough to work wherever adequate electronic records are available. This data collection system will build upon our prior work using the Knowledge Map Concept Identifier (KMCI), which was originally developed to extract biomedical concepts represented in the medical school curriculum at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. We will build a tool using KMCI as its core to detect receipt of CRC screening and to provide its context (e.g., individual risk factors, which CRC test was performed, when, and the results). Utilizing information from the electronic records and billing (claims) records, this system will allow for rapid and accurate identification of which patients have and have not received CRC screening tests, and for identification of those patients that require follow-up after their screening tests. We will determine the test characteristics of KMCI (sensitivity, specificity) for identifying receipt of CRC screening, and compare this to an automated review of billing records. We hypothesize that KMCI will perform better than an automated review of billing records in detecting receipt of CRC screening, and will provide richer, contextual information regarding the screening tests.           n/a",Identifying Receipt of Colorectal Cancer Screening,7340158,R21CA116573,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Electronics', 'Family history of', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health system', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Polyps', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening Result', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'billing data', 'cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'concept', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'novel', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R21,2008,121564,117374875,0.31136061961764816
"Mammography Visits to Improve Colon Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overall goal: to explore behavioral correlations between colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and screening mammography and develop an innovative approach for reducing barriers to CRC screening in women, using screening mammography, an existing non-colon cancer related screening test that has widespread public acceptance, as a ""teachable moment (TM).""  This study will be the first prospective study to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational intervention designed to increase CRC screening administered at a cancer screening visit unrelated to CRC. Specific alms: 1) To evaluate screening mammography as a setting (or ""teachable moment"") for administering CRC education; 2) To identify psychosocial barriers to colorectal cancer screening in women undergoing screening mammography; Aim 1 includes two separate randomized clinical trials to evaluate the effect of a CRC educational video on CRC screening adherence in women (aims 1A/1B) and an observational study evaluating screening mammography as a TM.  Aim 1A tests the efficacy of the CRC educational video intervention when administered during a screening mammography appointment.  Aim 1B tests the efficacy of the CRC educational video intervention when administered during a general medicine clinic visit.  Aim 1C tests the moderator effect of screening mammography on the effect of the educational intervention on CRC adherence using a quasi-experimental design by comparing the group receiving the CRC education intervention during screening mammography and the group who receive the same intervention during a noncancer screening-related clinic visit.  The primary outcome for aim 1 is the proportion of women due for CRC screening who complete screening within 6 months of the intervention.  Aim 2 uses survey methods to identify psychosocial barriers to CRC screening, based on the integrated TM-preventive health model.  A questionnaire will be prospectively administered to the participants prior to and immediately after the educational intervention.  Baseline information elicited from the study questionnaire and demographic characteristics will be used as independent variables in a series of multivariable analyses to assess the impact of each predictor on the non-adherence to CRC screening.  Predictor variables achieving statistical significance in the bivariate analyses (p<0.05) of non-adherence status and each of the potential predictor variables will be entered into a logistic model to determine independent variables associated with non-adherence to CRC screening. Forward stepwise logistic regression analysis will be used to determine factors predictive of non-adherence to any CRC screening strategy.  The project culminates in development and submission of an R-01 grant for development and testing of tailored messages directed at barriers identified in aim 2 and the development, testing and evaluation of a tailored education intervention to be delivered in a ""teachable moment"".             n/a",Mammography Visits to Improve Colon Cancer Screening,7425095,K07CA108664,"['Adherence', 'American', 'American Cancer Society', 'Appointment', 'Awareness', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic Visits', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Condition', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Experimental Designs', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Incidence', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Logistic Models', 'Logistics', 'Mammography', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Prospective Studies', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Regression Analysis', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'cancer education', 'cancer risk', 'career', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'disease natural history', 'evaluation/testing', 'health care delivery', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'point of care', 'psychosocial', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'transmission process']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K07,2008,136080,641965656,0.3049787377330609
"Understanding Reversed Race/Ethnic Associations with Cancer Screening Tests    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence for disparities in the utilization of screening tests plays a central role in the nation's efforts at cancer prevention and control. Persons in traditionally underserved racial and ethnic groups have had lower screening rates relative to non-Hispanic Whites. In addition, they often have disproportionately higher morbidity and mortality. The process of making decisions about groups in the population who are ""at-risk"" of lower screening test utilization typically starts with bivariate analyses of the associations between a set of potential covariates and use of a screening test. The next step is to conduct multivariable analysis most often using logistic regression, to identify the final set of variables that achieve statistical significance. This final set of statistically significant variables is then translated into population groups who need targeted interventions to reduce disparities. This proposed research addresses a situation we, and others, have observed in several analyses of cancer screening in population-based data sets. That is, analyses done with different survey databases have found several instances where bivariate associations between race/ethnicity and cancer screening have been ""reversed"" in multivariable analyses. That is, a group with lower screening in bivariate (""crude rate"") analysis shows higher screening based on the ""adjusted"" results from the multivariable analysis. These reversals may have implications not only for intervention planning, but also for the way that analyses are conducted to identify correlates of a screening procedure. The Specific Aims of this proposed research are: 1.) To investigate the extent of reversals of associations from bivariate to multivariable analyses of the correlates of cancer screening, by examining results several population-level surveys, by using multiple years of each survey, and by expanding the scope of screening tests to include both women and men. 2.) To investigate variables that may explain reversals of association when comparing the results of bivariate and multivariate analyses of factors associated with cancer screening tests. This two-year project will conduct secondary analyses with multiple years of data from three national- level surveys: The National Health Interview Survey, The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and the Health Information National Trends Survey. Five screening tests will be examined: mammography, clinical breast exam, Pap testing, prostate exam, and colorectal examination. This research will extend research to date in several ways. First, it greatly expands the number of survey databases being examined. Second, it expands the number of screening tests being reviewed, and gives added attention to male screening. Third, it uses definitions of screening that are as consistent as possible across the individual surveys. Fourth, it uses a consistent set of independent variables across the surveys. Fifth, it will be possible to look for trends over time in the presence of reversals of association for repeat screening.           n/a",Understanding Reversed Race/Ethnic Associations with Cancer Screening Tests,7404442,R21CA127828,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System', 'Breast', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diffusion', 'Disease regression', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Factor Analysis', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Health Information National Trends Survey', 'Individual', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Numbers', 'Pap smear', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Purpose', 'Race', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Statistically Significant', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'male', 'men', 'mortality', 'racial and ethnic', 'trend']",NCI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2008,191838,127562714,0.07155803382214322
"Adherence and the Economics of Colon Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Objectives: In environments with limited economic resources, it is paramount that the cost-effectiveness of competing strategies of management be compared. Our previous work illustrates that the cost-effectiveness of screening to decrease mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC) depends heavily on adherence, and specifically on whether adherence between screening strategies is heterogeneous. The objectives of this study are to: 1. Determine whether there exists heterogeneity in adherence between different CRC screening tests, 2. Utilize prospective rates of adherence to calculate the true incremental cost-effectiveness between competing CRC screening strategies, 3. Identify factors associated with non-adherence to screening. Research Design: Prospective cohort study in which subjects' adherence to CRC screening tests scheduled by their primary care provider (PCP) is measured. Strategies to be evaluated include fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS), colonoscopy, and virtual colonoscopy (VC, when approved for CRC screening). A study survey based on constructs of the Health Belief Model will be administered. Population to be Studied: Patients at average risk for development of CRC. Principal Source of Data: The primary outcome is adherence to CRC screening, defined as completion of the screening strategy scheduled for the subject within 12-months of enrollment, verified through computerized medical records and subject contact. Secondary outcomes include assessment of preventive intention, measured by subject scheduling of CRC tests, calculation of the incremental cost-effectiveness between competing strategies of CRC screening, and identification of survey and demographic items associated with non-adherence to CRC screening. Principal Types of Analysis: Specific objective 1 will compare adherence to FOBT, FS, colonoscopy, and VC. Specific objective 2 will calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio between competing CRC screening strategies incorporating the prospectively derived adherence rates. Specific objective 3 will examine the association between potential predictive factors identified from the study survey and non-adherence to CRC screening. Analytic methods will include Chi-square testing of proportions, linear mixed-effects modeling and logistic regression analysis. PCPs will be examined as random- and fixed-effects in separate models to account for potential clustering of outcomes within PCP practices. Cost-effectiveness analysis will use our published decision analytic models. Public Health: This study will compare adherence to competing screening tests in order to identify the most cost-effectiveness strategy to decrease mortality from CRC. Barriers to screening identified through this study will form the basis of future novel programs to increase CRC screening adherence.             n/a",Adherence and the Economics of Colon Cancer Screening,7495506,R01CA106773,"['Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'American', 'American Cancer Society', 'Caring', 'Chi-Square Tests', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Computed Tomographic Colonography', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Survey', 'Development', 'Economic Models', 'Economics', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Logistic Models', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Rate', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schedule', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Work', 'base', 'college', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'follow-up', 'health belief', 'mortality', 'novel', 'programs', 'prospective']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2008,271278,685608202,0.2664979367122581
"Promoting Colon Cancer Screening Among African Americans Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, affecting both men and women of all racial and ethnic groups.

Mediators and moderators of intervention effects and changes in health beliefs related to the interventions also will be determined.         n/a",Promoting Colon Cancer Screening Among African Americans,7409537,R01CA115983,"['Address', 'Adenomatous Polyps', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'American Cancer Society', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Colon', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'Counseling', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Excision', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Gender', 'Genus Cola', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior change', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicare', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Progress Review Group', 'Provider', 'Purpose', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sigmoidoscopy', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Today', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Week', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'cost', 'health belief', 'health disparity', 'health literacy', 'men', 'minority health', 'mortality', 'prevent', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'response', 'therapy design', 'uptake']",NCI,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2008,499736,232986943,0.30245783017761446
"Reducing disparities in colorectal cancer screening in Vietnamese Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in Vietnamese Americans are lower than those in non-Hispanic whites. Consistent with our long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer, we propose to disseminate an evidence-based lay health worker (LHW) intervention supported by a media campaign (Media) to increase CRC screening in this poor and medically underserved population. We will use the Pathways Framework, Community-Based Participatory Research process, and Diffusion of Innovations Theory to guide our approach to the intervention, community participation, and dissemination. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of a CRC LHW + Media intervention in increasing CRC screening among Vietnamese Americans aged 50 to 74 who have never had a CRC screening test, 2) identify predictors of CRC screening, and 3) evaluate the process of community participation. Following formative research using a cognitive testing approach to develop culturally and linguistically appropriate health education materials and survey instruments, we will conduct a cluster randomized trial among Vietnamese Americans aged 50-74 in Santa Clara County California, who have never had a CRC screening test prior to recruitment. We will follow two longitudinal cohorts among whom we will conduct a pre-intervention survey of participants' knowledge, intention, and behavior as regards CRC screening; implement CRC screening educational sessions in an experimental group and nutrition educational sessions in a comparison group; and conduct a post-intervention survey. Each of the two cohorts will include 150 men and 150 women to have a total sample size of 600. The media intervention component will distribute Vietnamese-language health education materials through print and electronic media. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by comparing the frequency of screening using pre- and post-intervention surveys. To test our primary hypothesis regarding the effects of the intervention on screening activity, we will use Z-tests. We will also employ logistic regression models to test the effects of the intervention and to identify predictors for CRC screening. In addition, we will conduct process evaluation of the intervention and community participation. If this intervention is found to be effective, this LHW model could be applied in health promotion programs to further reduce disparities in CRC screening in Vietnamese Americans and evaluated in other behavioral objectives and settings to reduce health disparities in other poor and underserved populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in Vietnamese Americans are lower than those in non-Hispanic whites. Relative to non-Hispanic whites, Vietnamese Americans are both poorer and less well medically served and have special language and cultural issues related to cancer screening that cannot be addressed though interventions aimed at the general population. Consistent with our long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer, we propose to disseminate an evidence-based lay health worker (LHW) intervention supported by a media campaign (Media) to increase CRC screening in this poor and medically underserved population. If this intervention is found to be effective, it could be applied in other health promotion programs throughout the United States to further reduce disparities in CRC screening in Vietnamese Americans. In addition, this LHW model could be evaluated in other populations, such as other racial and ethnic, poor, or immigrant communities; in other behavioral objectives, such as other forms of cancer, cardiovascular health, or tobacco, diabetes and obesity control; and in other settings, such as community health clinics and hospitals.

"Genetic Association Study in African-American Colorectal Cancer Patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant cause of cancer morbidity and mortality in the US. Determining who is at higher risk is especially important in CRC because screening tests are available that are proven to reduce death. Risk of CRC development is due to both hereditary and environmental factors which are not uniformly shared between all populations. To date, the field of CRC genetics has focused largely on Caucasian populations, while few studies have included African-American (AA) patients. Determining risk factors in AAs is an especially important goal because both incidence and mortality in this population are not decreasing as they are in all other US populations. At the University of Chicago, we are uniquely equipped to address genetic factors in AAs because we have assembled a large AA CRC case-control series. The main purpose of this study is to identify CRC-susceptibility alleles using a candidate gene screen approach and test for association in AA CRC patients and controls. CRC is particularly amenable to candidate gene studies because biologically relevant pathways have been identified in hereditary CRC syndromes and in the analysis of carcinogenesis in the adenoma to carcinoma sequence. The base excision repair pathway is especially interesting because recent work has elucidated a recessive polyposis syndrome associated with mutations in the gene MYH. Thus, genes involved in this pathway are biologically plausible candidates for harboring CRC-susceptibility alleles, but they have not been adequately identified or characterized in AAs to date. Our hypothesis is that novel susceptibility alleles in base-excision repair genes contribute to risk of CRC development in African-Americans. To test this hypothesis, we will screen candidate base-excision repair genes using high throughput heteroduplex analysis and use sequencing to characterize DNA changes (Specific Aim 1). To control for population stratification in our admixed AA population, we will determine individual ancestry estimates using a set of high informative ancestry informative markers (Specific Aim 2). Finally, we will genotype our putative CRC-susceptibility alleles identified in our candidate gene screens in a series of 400 AA CRC cases and 400 controls and then test for association by logistic regression (Specific Aim 3). With improved understanding of individual risk and proper screening, colorectal cancer is largely a preventable disease. The goal of our study is to better understand hereditary factors that increase risk especially in African-Americans who have the highest incidence and death from this cancer.           n/a",Genetic Association Study in African-American Colorectal Cancer Patients,7409260,F32CA132493,"['Address', 'African American', 'Alleles', 'Base Excision Repairs', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Carcinoma', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cessation of life', 'Chicago', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heteroduplex Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Predisposition', 'Purpose', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Stratification', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'cancer genetics', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'gene repair', 'genetic association', 'improved', 'interest', 'mortality', 'novel', 'polyposis']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F32,2007,56702,246330700,0.2704803669414655
"Identifying Receipt of Colorectal Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Regular screening for CRC leads to early detection and a substantial reduction in CRC-related morbidity and mortality. Despite this evidence, adherence to CRC screening recommendations remains poor. Given the benefits of screening for CRC, interventions need to be developed that will ultimately increase its utilization. These interventions must be targeted towards individuals who have never been screened or are not current with their screening, and must take into account risk factors [e.g., family history, inflammatory bowel disease, history of previous adenomas]. A significant barrier to applying CRC screening interventions is the ability to accurately and quickly identify patients in need of screening. In our proposed project, we will create and evaluate an innovative electronic data collection system to enhance our understanding of the delivery and utilization of CRC screening. We will use as a test site the primary care clinics affiliated with Vanderbilt University Medical Center, but the approach developed will be general enough to work wherever adequate electronic records are available. This data collection system will build upon our prior work using the Knowledge Map Concept Identifier (KMCI), which was originally developed to extract biomedical concepts represented in the medical school curriculum at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. We will build a tool using KMCI as its core to detect receipt of CRC screening and to provide its context (e.g., individual risk factors, which CRC test was performed, when, and the results). Utilizing information from the electronic records and billing (claims) records, this system will allow for rapid and accurate identification of which patients have and have not received CRC screening tests, and for identification of those patients that require follow-up after their screening tests. We will determine the test characteristics of KMCI (sensitivity, specificity) for identifying receipt of CRC screening, and compare this to an automated review of billing records. We hypothesize that KMCI will perform better than an automated review of billing records in detecting receipt of CRC screening, and will provide richer, contextual information regarding the screening tests.           n/a",Identifying Receipt of Colorectal Cancer Screening,7212022,R21CA116573,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Electronics', 'Family history of', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health system', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Polyps', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening Result', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'billing data', 'cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'concept', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'novel', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MED CTR,R21,2007,122600,0,0.31136061961764816
"Mammography Visits to Improve Colon Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overall goal: to explore behavioral correlations between colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and screening mammography and develop an innovative approach for reducing barriers to CRC screening in women, using screening mammography, an existing non-colon cancer related screening test that has widespread public acceptance, as a ""teachable moment (TM).""  This study will be the first prospective study to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational intervention designed to increase CRC screening administered at a cancer screening visit unrelated to CRC. Specific alms: 1) To evaluate screening mammography as a setting (or ""teachable moment"") for administering CRC education; 2) To identify psychosocial barriers to colorectal cancer screening in women undergoing screening mammography; Aim 1 includes two separate randomized clinical trials to evaluate the effect of a CRC educational video on CRC screening adherence in women (aims 1A/1B) and an observational study evaluating screening mammography as a TM.  Aim 1A tests the efficacy of the CRC educational video intervention when administered during a screening mammography appointment.  Aim 1B tests the efficacy of the CRC educational video intervention when administered during a general medicine clinic visit.  Aim 1C tests the moderator effect of screening mammography on the effect of the educational intervention on CRC adherence using a quasi-experimental design by comparing the group receiving the CRC education intervention during screening mammography and the group who receive the same intervention during a noncancer screening-related clinic visit.  The primary outcome for aim 1 is the proportion of women due for CRC screening who complete screening within 6 months of the intervention.  Aim 2 uses survey methods to identify psychosocial barriers to CRC screening, based on the integrated TM-preventive health model.  A questionnaire will be prospectively administered to the participants prior to and immediately after the educational intervention.  Baseline information elicited from the study questionnaire and demographic characteristics will be used as independent variables in a series of multivariable analyses to assess the impact of each predictor on the non-adherence to CRC screening.  Predictor variables achieving statistical significance in the bivariate analyses (p<0.05) of non-adherence status and each of the potential predictor variables will be entered into a logistic model to determine independent variables associated with non-adherence to CRC screening. Forward stepwise logistic regression analysis will be used to determine factors predictive of non-adherence to any CRC screening strategy.  The project culminates in development and submission of an R-01 grant for development and testing of tailored messages directed at barriers identified in aim 2 and the development, testing and evaluation of a tailored education intervention to be delivered in a ""teachable moment"".             n/a",Mammography Visits to Improve Colon Cancer Screening,7236205,K07CA108664,"['Adherence', 'American', 'American Cancer Society', 'Appointment', 'Awareness', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic Visits', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Condition', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Experimental Designs', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Incidence', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Logistic Models', 'Logistics', 'Mammography', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Prospective Studies', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Regression Analysis', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'cancer education', 'cancer risk', 'career', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'disease natural history', 'evaluation/testing', 'health care delivery', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'point of care', 'psychosocial', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'transmission process']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,K07,2007,136080,0,0.3049787377330609
"Understanding Reversed Race/Ethnic Associations with Cancer Screening Tests    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence for disparities in the utilization of screening tests plays a central role in the nation's efforts at cancer prevention and control. Persons in traditionally underserved racial and ethnic groups have had lower screening rates relative to non-Hispanic Whites. In addition, they often have disproportionately higher morbidity and mortality. The process of making decisions about groups in the population who are ""at-risk"" of lower screening test utilization typically starts with bivariate analyses of the associations between a set of potential covariates and use of a screening test. The next step is to conduct multivariable analysis most often using logistic regression, to identify the final set of variables that achieve statistical significance. This final set of statistically significant variables is then translated into population groups who need targeted interventions to reduce disparities. This proposed research addresses a situation we, and others, have observed in several analyses of cancer screening in population-based data sets. That is, analyses done with different survey databases have found several instances where bivariate associations between race/ethnicity and cancer screening have been ""reversed"" in multivariable analyses. That is, a group with lower screening in bivariate (""crude rate"") analysis shows higher screening based on the ""adjusted"" results from the multivariable analysis. These reversals may have implications not only for intervention planning, but also for the way that analyses are conducted to identify correlates of a screening procedure. The Specific Aims of this proposed research are: 1.) To investigate the extent of reversals of associations from bivariate to multivariable analyses of the correlates of cancer screening, by examining results several population-level surveys, by using multiple years of each survey, and by expanding the scope of screening tests to include both women and men. 2.) To investigate variables that may explain reversals of association when comparing the results of bivariate and multivariate analyses of factors associated with cancer screening tests. This two-year project will conduct secondary analyses with multiple years of data from three national- level surveys: The National Health Interview Survey, The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and the Health Information National Trends Survey. Five screening tests will be examined: mammography, clinical breast exam, Pap testing, prostate exam, and colorectal examination. This research will extend research to date in several ways. First, it greatly expands the number of survey databases being examined. Second, it expands the number of screening tests being reviewed, and gives added attention to male screening. Third, it uses definitions of screening that are as consistent as possible across the individual surveys. Fourth, it uses a consistent set of independent variables across the surveys. Fifth, it will be possible to look for trends over time in the presence of reversals of association for repeat screening.           n/a",Understanding Reversed Race/Ethnic Associations with Cancer Screening Tests,7238472,R21CA127828,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System', 'Breast', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diffusion', 'Disease regression', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Factor Analysis', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Health Information National Trends Survey', 'Individual', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Numbers', 'Pap smear', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Purpose', 'Race', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Statistically Significant', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'male', 'men', 'mortality', 'racial and ethnic', 'trend']",NCI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2007,168472,127562714,0.07155803382214322
"Adherence and the Economics of Colon Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Objectives: In environments with limited economic resources, it is paramount that the cost-effectiveness of competing strategies of management be compared. Our previous work illustrates that the cost-effectiveness of screening to decrease mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC) depends heavily on adherence, and specifically on whether adherence between screening strategies is heterogeneous. The objectives of this study are to: 1. Determine whether there exists heterogeneity in adherence between different CRC screening tests, 2. Utilize prospective rates of adherence to calculate the true incremental cost-effectiveness between competing CRC screening strategies, 3. Identify factors associated with non-adherence to screening. Research Design: Prospective cohort study in which subjects' adherence to CRC screening tests scheduled by their primary care provider (PCP) is measured. Strategies to be evaluated include fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS), colonoscopy, and virtual colonoscopy (VC, when approved for CRC screening). A study survey based on constructs of the Health Belief Model will be administered. Population to be Studied: Patients at average risk for development of CRC. Principal Source of Data: The primary outcome is adherence to CRC screening, defined as completion of the screening strategy scheduled for the subject within 12-months of enrollment, verified through computerized medical records and subject contact. Secondary outcomes include assessment of preventive intention, measured by subject scheduling of CRC tests, calculation of the incremental cost-effectiveness between competing strategies of CRC screening, and identification of survey and demographic items associated with non-adherence to CRC screening. Principal Types of Analysis: Specific objective 1 will compare adherence to FOBT, FS, colonoscopy, and VC. Specific objective 2 will calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio between competing CRC screening strategies incorporating the prospectively derived adherence rates. Specific objective 3 will examine the association between potential predictive factors identified from the study survey and non-adherence to CRC screening. Analytic methods will include Chi-square testing of proportions, linear mixed-effects modeling and logistic regression analysis. PCPs will be examined as random- and fixed-effects in separate models to account for potential clustering of outcomes within PCP practices. Cost-effectiveness analysis will use our published decision analytic models. Public Health: This study will compare adherence to competing screening tests in order to identify the most cost-effectiveness strategy to decrease mortality from CRC. Barriers to screening identified through this study will form the basis of future novel programs to increase CRC screening adherence.             n/a",Adherence and the Economics of Colon Cancer Screening,7277322,R01CA106773,"['Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'American', 'American Cancer Society', 'Caring', 'Chi-Square Tests', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Computed Tomographic Colonography', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Survey', 'Development', 'Economic Models', 'Economics', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Logistic Models', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Rate', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schedule', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Work', 'base', 'college', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'follow-up', 'health belief', 'mortality', 'novel', 'programs', 'prospective']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO,R01,2007,325358,0,0.2664979367122581
"Increasing CRC Screening in Primary Care Settings    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Regular screening reduces both morbidity and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC). Screening rates, however, remain low suggesting the need for innovative research designed to increase screening behavior. The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two interventions (Tailored Health Communications [THC] and Motivational Interviewing [MI]) in increasing CRC screening behavior. Both interventions are based on a strong conceptual framework derived from the Health Belief Model (HBM) and Transtheoretical Model (TTM), allowing us to explore the underlying mechanisms through which these interventions impact behavior change. The primary aim of this study is to compare CRC screening test use among 804 participants randomly allocated to control or intervention conditions; 402 participants will be recruited from each site (Salt Lake City, UT and Nashville, TN). The three study groups will receive (1) standard care, (2) tailored health communication, and (3) motivational interviewing. Eligibility criteria for study participants includes being 50 years or older, not having CRC, and being of average or moderate risk for CRC. Study participants will be surveyed by telephone about CRC related beliefs pre-intervention (Time 1), one month post intervention (Time 2), and at 6 and 12 months (Times 3 and 4 respectively). Salt Like City participants will be primarily Caucasian and those from Nashville will be African American. Dichotomous behavioral outcomes (had screening test or not) and stages of CRC screening test adoption (based on the TTM) will be assessed, as well as sociodemographic and belief predictors of screening behavior. Binomial and multinomial logistic regression models will be used to evaluate screening test use and stage of test adoption. Sociodemographic and belief variables will be used as covariates, with intervention groups at the primary independent predictor. Descriptive statistics and ANOVA will be employed to assess between intervention differences in amenable beliefs. Path (mediation) analysis will be performed to further explore the underlying mechanisms through which THC and MI may differentially affect CRC screening behavior.         n/a",Increasing CRC Screening in Primary Care Settings,7222783,R01NR008425,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Cities', 'Clinic', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Condition', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Health Communication', 'Health behavior change', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Nature', 'Neuro-Oncological Ventral Antigen 2', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Primary Health Care', 'Purpose', 'Randomized', 'Rate', 'Readiness', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Sigmoidoscopy', 'Site', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Surveys', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Today', 'United States', 'base', 'behavior change', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'compare effectiveness', 'health belief', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'statistics', 'therapy design']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS,R01,2007,415821,0,0.30210228158116753
"Promoting Colon Cancer Screening Among African Amercians Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, affecting both men and women of all racial and ethnic groups. The majority of these deaths could be prevented since CRC, when discovered early, is highly treatable and screening that leads to removal of adenomatous polyps decreases CRC incidence by 75% to 90%. Nationally, in 2002, only 50% of adults aged 50 or older reported having had any screening test in the recommended intervals. Both CRC incidence and mortality rates are higher among African Americans than any other racial group. These health disparities are due, in part, to delay in diagnosis resulting in advanced stage disease at presentation. Lower rates of CRC screening participation among African Americans contribute to this burden. Interactive computer-based interventions effectively promote health behavior change by delivering individualized, or tailored, health information and counseling. In pilot testing, a tailored, interactive computer intervention designed to promote CRC screening among African Americans resulted in increased CRC knowledge and higher rates of fecal occult blood testing. The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of a tailored, interactive computer intervention to promote CRC screening by comparing it to, and combining it with, a physician recommendation, which has been found to be a significant predictor of CRC screening. A sample of 1248 African American men and women who are being seen in two Midwestern primary care networks and who are non-adherent to colon cancer screening guidelines will be randomly assigned to receive either: 1) a CRC screening brochure; 2) an interactive computer intervention; or 3) the interactive computer intervention plus the brochure.

"Physician Characteristics and Colorectal Cancer Stage    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Survival is strongly determined by stage at the time of diagnosis but only approximately 40% of all new cases are diagnosed at local stage. Effective screening methods are available which can lead to early detection and reduced mortality from this disease, but these remain underutilized. We believe the factors that influence colorectal cancer screening rates in a population determine the stage at diagnosis of colorectal cancer in that population. We propose to conduct a population based case: control study to identify factors associated with stage at diagnosis of colorectal cancer in a high-risk, underserved population. In particular, we will study the relationship between physician characteristics, type of practice, specialty training, knowledge of screening guidelines, attitudes regarding screening, actual screening practices, approaches to patient education and communication, and perceived barriers to screening in relation to stage at colorectal cancer diagnosis. The study will compare approximately 533 patients with incident local stage invasive colorectal cancer (cases) and 1242 patients with more advanced stage disease (controls) identified from a population-based cancer registry. Logistic regression will be used to assess the relationship between cancer stage and physician characteristics and behaviors while controlling for confounding. This research will increase the knowledge base regarding screening practices of community-based physicians and how these practices affect stage at diagnosis and ultimately colorectal cancer outcome. A better understanding of the utilization of currently available screening procedures and attitudes toward screening will help illuminate the reasons for the low prevalence of colorectal screening and high colorectal mortality observed in the United States. Public Health Relevance: Underutilization of colorectal cancer screening contributes to delays in detection causing patients to be diagnosed with larger (more advanced stage) tumors. We will conduct a study examining the relation between physician factors (training, beliefs about screening, screening practices) and stage at diagnosis of colorectal cancer. These characteristics can be used to identify practitioners likely to benefit from educational efforts designed to increase colorectal cancer screening.         n/a",Physician Characteristics and Colorectal Cancer Stage,7128538,R03CA113107,"['behavioral /social science research tag', 'clinical research', 'colorectal neoplasms', 'early diagnosis', 'health care personnel performance', 'health care service availability', 'health care service evaluation', 'health care service utilization', 'health services research tag', 'human subject', 'mass screening', 'medically underserved population', 'neoplasm /cancer classification /staging', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'patient oriented research']",NCI,NORTHEAST REGIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,R03,2006,46328,0,0.08964452236531777
"Colorectal Cancer Screening Behavior in the VA Populatio DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background:Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of Cancer death in the United States. In spite of demonstrated efficacy and guideline recommendations, colorectal cancer screening rates are low.  Purpose: This study is the next step in development and validation of new instrument, the Colorectal Cancer Screening Behavior Questionnaire (CRCSBQ) to measure colorectal cancer screening participation. The long- term goal of this study is to contribute to the development of a resource of cancer screening measures with known validity across multiple settings and populations.  Methods: Phase 1: The CRCSBQ will undergo cognitive testing in a sample of patients (32 total) at two geographically diverse Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities. Patients will be from the primary care clinics, over age 50 and include Caucasians and African-Americans of both genders. Phase 2: The CRCSBQ and a demographics questionnaire will be administered to 200 (total) primary care patients at the 2 sites. In addition, medical record data will abstracted from the VA electronic medical record, non-VA medical records and Medicare claims data (patients older than 65). The questionnaire responses will be compared to the medical record data. We will calculate point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the concordance, relative sensitivity, specificity and report-to-records ratio of the CRCSBQ to detect current colorectal cancer screening status by the American Cancer Society guidelines compared to the medical record review. We will use logistic regression analysis to explore patient factors that may be associated with agreement between self-report and medical records for colorectal cancer screening.  Importance: Accurate measurement of colorectal cancer screening behavior is the essential first step in studying the problem of low screening rates.

"Mammography Visits to Improve Colon Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overall goal: to explore behavioral correlations between colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and screening mammography and develop an innovative approach for reducing barriers to CRC screening in women, using screening mammography, an existing non-colon cancer related screening test that has widespread public acceptance, as a ""teachable moment (TM).""  This study will be the first prospective study to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational intervention designed to increase CRC screening administered at a cancer screening visit unrelated to CRC. Specific alms: 1) To evaluate screening mammography as a setting (or ""teachable moment"") for administering CRC education; 2) To identify psychosocial barriers to colorectal cancer screening in women undergoing screening mammography; Aim 1 includes two separate randomized clinical trials to evaluate the effect of a CRC educational video on CRC screening adherence in women (aims 1A/1B) and an observational study evaluating screening mammography as a TM.  Aim 1A tests the efficacy of the CRC educational video intervention when administered during a screening mammography appointment.  Aim 1B tests the efficacy of the CRC educational video intervention when administered during a general medicine clinic visit.  Aim 1C tests the moderator effect of screening mammography on the effect of the educational intervention on CRC adherence using a quasi-experimental design by comparing the group receiving the CRC education intervention during screening mammography and the group who receive the same intervention during a noncancer screening-related clinic visit.  The primary outcome for aim 1 is the proportion of women due for CRC screening who complete screening within 6 months of the intervention.  Aim 2 uses survey methods to identify psychosocial barriers to CRC screening, based on the integrated TM-preventive health model.  A questionnaire will be prospectively administered to the participants prior to and immediately after the educational intervention.  Baseline information elicited from the study questionnaire and demographic characteristics will be used as independent variables in a series of multivariable analyses to assess the impact of each predictor on the non-adherence to CRC screening.  Predictor variables achieving statistical significance in the bivariate analyses (p<0.05) of non-adherence status and each of the potential predictor variables will be entered into a logistic model to determine independent variables associated with non-adherence to CRC screening. Forward stepwise logistic regression analysis will be used to determine factors predictive of non-adherence to any CRC screening strategy.

"Colorectal Screening in Vietnamese : A Controlled Trial DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project is designed to increase colorectal cancer screening among Vietnamese Americans in Northern California through an intervention focused on educating Vietnamese American public and their health care providers. The objective of this study is to reduce morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in Vietnamese American men and the fourth in women. The rate of colorectal screening is low among Vietnamese Americans; only 35 percent of Vietnamese have ever had a fecal occult blood test. The aims of this project are: 1) increase colorectal cancer screening among Vietnamese Americans ages 50 to 74 through a multifaceted intervention; and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by following longitudinal cohorts in a controlled trial; 3) identify predictors of screening.   The primary hypotheses are that the proportions of Vietnamese Americans ages 50 to 74 who 1) have ever had a colorectal cancer screening test; or 2) are up-to-date for colorectal cancer screening will increase more in the intervention population than in the control. The intervention will be carried out over 24 months in Alameda and Santa Clara Counties, California with Vietnamese Americans in Harris County, Texas serving as the control population. Building on the ""Pathways"" conceptual framework and our preliminary qualitative and quantitative research findings, the intervention will promote colorectal cancer screening by: 1) reaching Vietnamese Americans through a print and electronic media campaign that will distribute Vietnamese language health education information; and 2) reaching health care providers with Vietnamese-language counseling materials, training videos, and continuing medical education seminars. We will conduct formative research using focus groups to develop culturally appropriate materials (booklets, calendars, posters, and a web site) and products for distribution through Vietnamese-language media (newspaper, television, and radio advertisements). We will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by comparing rates of screening using pre- and post intervention surveys. To test the primary hypotheses we will use z-tests to determine if the differences in the change in rates (deltas) between the intervention and control populations are statistically significant. We will also generate logistic regression models to test the independent effects of the intervention and to identify predictors for colorectal cancer screening. n/a",Colorectal Screening in Vietnamese : A Controlled Trial,7061307,R01CA100856,"['Asian Americans', 'Internet', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'clinical research', 'clinical trials', 'colorectal neoplasms', 'continuing education', 'education evaluation /planning', 'educational resource design /development', 'health disparity', 'health surveys', 'human middle age (35-64)', 'human old age (65+)', 'human subject', 'information dissemination', 'longitudinal human study', 'mass screening', 'medical education', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'neoplasm /cancer education', 'patient oriented research', 'radio', 'television', 'videotape /videodisc']",NCI,CANCER PREVENTION INSTIT OF CALIFORNIA,R01,2006,322534,0,0.14328618647847802
"Adherence and the Economics of Colon Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Objectives: In environments with limited economic resources, it is paramount that the cost-effectiveness of competing strategies of management be compared. Our previous work illustrates that the cost-effectiveness of screening to decrease mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC) depends heavily on adherence, and specifically on whether adherence between screening strategies is heterogeneous. The objectives of this study are to: 1. Determine whether there exists heterogeneity in adherence between different CRC screening tests, 2. Utilize prospective rates of adherence to calculate the true incremental cost-effectiveness between competing CRC screening strategies, 3. Identify factors associated with non-adherence to screening. Research Design: Prospective cohort study in which subjects' adherence to CRC screening tests scheduled by their primary care provider (PCP) is measured. Strategies to be evaluated include fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS), colonoscopy, and virtual colonoscopy (VC, when approved for CRC screening). A study survey based on constructs of the Health Belief Model will be administered. Population to be Studied: Patients at average risk for development of CRC. Principal Source of Data: The primary outcome is adherence to CRC screening, defined as completion of the screening strategy scheduled for the subject within 12-months of enrollment, verified through computerized medical records and subject contact. Secondary outcomes include assessment of preventive intention, measured by subject scheduling of CRC tests, calculation of the incremental cost-effectiveness between competing strategies of CRC screening, and identification of survey and demographic items associated with non-adherence to CRC screening. Principal Types of Analysis: Specific objective 1 will compare adherence to FOBT, FS, colonoscopy, and VC. Specific objective 2 will calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio between competing CRC screening strategies incorporating the prospectively derived adherence rates. Specific objective 3 will examine the association between potential predictive factors identified from the study survey and non-adherence to CRC screening. Analytic methods will include Chi-square testing of proportions, linear mixed-effects modeling and logistic regression analysis. PCPs will be examined as random- and fixed-effects in separate models to account for potential clustering of outcomes within PCP practices. Cost-effectiveness analysis will use our published decision analytic models. Public Health: This study will compare adherence to competing screening tests in order to identify the most cost-effectiveness strategy to decrease mortality from CRC. Barriers to screening identified through this study will form the basis of future novel programs to increase CRC screening adherence.             n/a",Adherence and the Economics of Colon Cancer Screening,7033273,R01CA106773,"['belief', 'clinical research', 'colon neoplasms', 'cost effectiveness', 'endoscopy', 'gastrointestinal imaging /visualization', 'health', 'model']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO,R01,2006,348147,0,0.2664979367122581
"Promoting Colon Cancer Screening Among African Amercians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, affecting both men and women of all racial and ethnic groups. The majority of these deaths could be prevented since CRC, when discovered early, is highly treatable and screening that leads to removal of adenomatous polyps decreases CRC incidence by 75% to 90%. Nationally, in 2002, only 50% of adults aged 50 or older reported having had any screening test in the recommended intervals. Both CRC incidence and mortality rates are higher among African Americans than any other racial group. These health disparities are due, in part, to delay in diagnosis resulting in advanced stage disease at presentation. Lower rates of CRC screening participation among African Americans contribute to this burden. Interactive computer-based interventions effectively promote health behavior change by delivering individualized, or tailored, health information and counseling. In pilot testing, a tailored, interactive computer intervention designed to promote CRC screening among African Americans resulted in increased CRC knowledge and higher rates of fecal occult blood testing. The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of a tailored, interactive computer intervention to promote CRC screening by comparing it to, and combining it with, a physician recommendation, which has been found to be a significant predictor of CRC screening. A sample of 1248 African American men and women who are being seen in two Midwestern primary care networks and who are non-adherent to colon cancer screening guidelines will be randomly assigned to receive either: 1) a CRC screening brochure; 2) an interactive computer intervention; or 3) the interactive computer intervention plus the brochure. Both process and outcome variables will be examined. Rates of adherence to fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy are primary outcomes examined at 6 and 15 months. Logistic regression models will be used to test intervention effects separately for two outcomes, fecal occult blood testing (initial and repeat) and endoscopic screening, while adjusting for potentially confounding covariates. Mediators and moderators of intervention effects and changes in health beliefs related to the interventions also will be determined.              n/a",Promoting Colon Cancer Screening Among African Amercians,7089697,R01CA115983,"['African American', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'blood tests', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'clinical research', 'colon neoplasms', 'computer assisted instruction', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'education evaluation /planning', 'endoscopy', 'focus groups', 'gastrointestinal imaging /visualization', 'handbook', 'health behavior', 'health disparity', 'health services research tag', 'human subject', 'interactive multimedia', 'interview', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'neoplasm /cancer education', 'patient oriented research', 'racial /ethnic difference']",NCI,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2006,451935,232986943,0.3040264867011372
"Increasing CRC Screening in Primary Care Settings    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Regular screening reduces both morbidity and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC). Screening rates, however, remain low suggesting the need for innovative research designed to increase screening behavior. The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two interventions (Tailored Health Communications [THC] and Motivational Interviewing [MI]) in increasing CRC screening behavior. Both interventions are based on a strong conceptual framework derived from the Health Belief Model (HBM) and Transtheoretical Model (TTM), allowing us to explore the underlying mechanisms through which these interventions impact behavior change. The primary aim of this study is to compare CRC screening test use among 804 participants randomly allocated to control or intervention conditions; 402 participants will be recruited from each site (Salt Lake City, UT and Nashville, TN). The three study groups will receive (1) standard care, (2) tailored health communication, and (3) motivational interviewing. Eligibility criteria for study participants includes being 50 years or older, not having CRC, and being of average or moderate risk for CRC. Study participants will be surveyed by telephone about CRC related beliefs pre-intervention (Time 1), one month post intervention (Time 2), and at 6 and 12 months (Times 3 and 4 respectively). Salt Like City participants will be primarily Caucasian and those from Nashville will be African American. Dichotomous behavioral outcomes (had screening test or not) and stages of CRC screening test adoption (based on the TTM) will be assessed, as well as sociodemographic and belief predictors of screening behavior. Binomial and multinomial logistic regression models will be used to evaluate screening test use and stage of test adoption. Sociodemographic and belief variables will be used as covariates, with intervention groups at the primary independent predictor. Descriptive statistics and ANOVA will be employed to assess between intervention differences in amenable beliefs. Path (mediation) analysis will be performed to further explore the underlying mechanisms through which THC and MI may differentially affect CRC screening behavior.         n/a",Increasing CRC Screening in Primary Care Settings,7026013,R01NR008425,"['African American', 'behavior modification', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'belief', 'cancer risk', 'caucasian American', 'clinical research', 'colorectal neoplasms', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'disease /disorder prevention /control', 'early diagnosis', 'health behavior', 'health care service utilization', 'health services research tag', 'human subject', 'interview', 'longitudinal human study', 'motivation', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'patient care management', 'racial /ethnic difference']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2006,510643,148463823,0.30210228158116753

Building on the ""Pathways"" conceptual framework and our preliminary qualitative and quantitative research findings, the intervention will promote colorectal cancer screening by: 1) reaching Vietnamese Americans through a print and electronic media campaign that will distribute Vietnamese language health education information; and 2) reaching health care providers with Vietnamese-language counseling materials, training videos, and continuing medical education seminars. We will conduct formative research using focus groups to develop culturally appropriate materials (booklets, calendars, posters, and a web site) and products for distribution through Vietnamese-language media (newspaper, television, and radio advertisements). We will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by comparing rates of screening using pre- and post intervention surveys. To test the primary hypotheses we will use z-tests to determine if the differences in the change in rates (deltas) between the intervention and control populations are statistically significant. We will also generate logistic regression models to test the independent effects of the intervention and to identify predictors for colorectal cancer screening. n/a",Colorectal Screening in Vietnamese : A Controlled Trial,6887830,R01CA100856,"['Asian Americans', 'Internet', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'clinical research', 'clinical trials', 'colorectal neoplasms', 'continuing education', 'education evaluation /planning', 'educational resource design /development', 'health disparity', 'health surveys', 'human middle age (35-64)', 'human old age (65+)', 'human subject', 'information dissemination', 'longitudinal human study', 'mass screening', 'medical education', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'neoplasm /cancer education', 'patient oriented research', 'radio', 'television', 'videotape /videodisc']",NCI,CANCER PREVENTION INSTIT OF CALIFORNIA,R01,2005,437729,0,0.14328618647847802
"Increasing CRC Screening in Primary Care Settings    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Regular screening reduces both morbidity and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC). Screening rates, however, remain low suggesting the need for innovative research designed to increase screening behavior. The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two interventions (Tailored Health Communications [THC] and Motivational Interviewing [MI]) in increasing CRC screening behavior. Both interventions are based on a strong conceptual framework derived from the Health Belief Model (HBM) and Transtheoretical Model (TTM), allowing us to explore the underlying mechanisms through which these interventions impact behavior change. The primary aim of this study is to compare CRC screening test use among 804 participants randomly allocated to control or intervention conditions; 402 participants will be recruited from each site (Salt Lake City, UT and Nashville, TN). The three study groups will receive (1) standard care, (2) tailored health communication, and (3) motivational interviewing. Eligibility criteria for study participants includes being 50 years or older, not having CRC, and being of average or moderate risk for CRC. Study participants will be surveyed by telephone about CRC related beliefs pre-intervention (Time 1), one month post intervention (Time 2), and at 6 and 12 months (Times 3 and 4 respectively). Salt Like City participants will be primarily Caucasian and those from Nashville will be African American. Dichotomous behavioral outcomes (had screening test or not) and stages of CRC screening test adoption (based on the TTM) will be assessed, as well as sociodemographic and belief predictors of screening behavior. Binomial and multinomial logistic regression models will be used to evaluate screening test use and stage of test adoption. Sociodemographic and belief variables will be used as covariates, with intervention groups at the primary independent predictor.

"Organizational Predictors of Colon Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Several recent reports including the Institute of Medicine's ""Crossing the Quality Chasm"" have called attention to systems or organizational level factors as critical to the improvement of health care quality in the United States. In addition, understanding the context or environment in which an organization exists is also important to crafting policy-relevant research. The predominance of managed care organizations over the last two decades is an example of an environmental influence that has changed the organization and delivery of health care in the United States. The purpose of the proposed research is to examine how the environmental context of an organization influences organizational structures and processes and ultimately affects the care delivered at the site. The clinical focus of this study is colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. To date, most of the research on the delivery of CRC screening has focused on individual patient-level factors, leaving the influence of organizational factors poorly understood. This cross sectional study uses data from several different sources including: Interstudy, the Area Resource File, and the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA). Ordinary least squares and multi-level logistic regression models will be used to explore: (1) the relationship between managed care penetration and adoption of managed care practices in the VHA that may affect CRC screening rates; (2) the relationship between managed care penetration and receipt of colorectal cancer screening within the VHA system; and (3) the effect of managed care penetration on the probability of receiving CRC screening inside the VHA system among those who received CRC screening. Understanding the relationship of organizational influences and variations in the delivery of CRC screening will provide a better understanding of the barriers to the use of this service. Such information may serve as the basis for the design of interventions to improve CRC screening.         n/a",Organizational Predictors of Colon Cancer Screening,6802918,R36HS014518,"['colorectal neoplasms', 'health care quality', 'health care service organization', 'health care service utilization', 'health services research tag', 'human data', 'managed care', 'mathematical model', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'statistics /biometry']",AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R36,2004,29997,673201228,0.24464623984686035

"Colorectal Screening in Vietnamese : A Controlled Trial DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project is designed to increase colorectal cancer screening among Vietnamese Americans in Northern California through an intervention focused on educating Vietnamese American public and their health care providers. The objective of this study is to reduce morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in Vietnamese American men and the fourth in women.

"Telehealth Intervention for Colorectal Cancer Screening  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  First-degree relatives of people who have been diagnosed with colorectal adenomatous polyps (CAP) have a two-fold-increased risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). Regular endoscopic screening with flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy leads to removal of precancerous polyps, which has been shown to decrease CRC incidence by 75% to 90%. Tailored telephone counseling, one specific type of telehealth intervention has demonstrated considerable promise as an intervention that motivates people to change health behaviors. The purpose of the proposed study is to compare the effectiveness of two interventions, a tailored telephone counseling intervention and a nontailored print intervention, designed to increase participation in CRC with sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. The nontailored intervention will be an American Cancer Society health education booklet that contains messages about colorectal cancer, risk factors, screening recommendations, and screening tests. The tailored telephone counseling intervention will be delivered by trained nurses and will contain individually tailored messages for each participant based on baseline assessment of their individual demographics, CRC risk factors, Health Belief Model constructs (perceived risks, benefits, barriers, self-efficacy), and stages of change for sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. This study contrasts two groups of first-degree relatives (FDRs) who will be randomly assigned to the tailored telephone intervention arm or the nontailored intervention arm. Participants will be 220 FDRs (110 in each arm) who were referred by family members diagnosed with CAP. Data will be collected via structured telephone interviews at baseline, prior to randomization, and at 3 months post-baseline. Behavioral outcomes will be measured dichotomously by whether participants have has a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy and by stages of change for sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy based on Prochaska and DiClemente's Transtheoretical Model. Both process and outcome evaluations are planned. Primary analyses of screening participation outcomes will use Fischer's exact test to compare proportions of participants who report being screened with sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy at follow-up. Logistic regression will be used to examine other potential predictors of screening participation. Stages of change will be tested using ordinal logistic regression with group as the predictor for each screening test.   n/a",Telehealth Intervention for Colorectal Cancer Screening,6573717,R15NR007999,"['adenomatous polyps', ' cancer risk', ' clinical research', ' colorectal neoplasms', ' counseling', ' endoscopy', ' family genetics', ' gastrointestinal imaging /visualization', ' genetic susceptibility', ' health behavior', ' human subject', ' interview', ' nursing intervention', ' questionnaires', ' telemedicine']",NINR,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R15,2003,150500,232986943,0.21867592795191965

"Interventions to Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer death in the United States with the majority of CRC diagnosed in those aged 50 or older. Prospective data indicate that annual fecal occult blood tests (FOBT) can decease mortality from CRC. The American Cancer Society recommends an annual FOBT and a flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years. Utilization of these tests is very low, ranging from 19% to 39%, especially among those who are 50 or older and most at risk for developing the disease.

"FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING DESCRIPTION:  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer      mortality among men and women in the United States.  Though early detection      can lead to decreased mortality and morbidity, screening remains markedly        underutilized by persons at increased risk:  those aged 51 and older and         those with a family history, personal history of colorectal polyps,              ulcerative colitis, high fat/low fiber diets, and sedentary life-styles.         And, previous research findings with respect to breast cancer prevention         have shown that beliefs and health system factors can influence screening        behavior.  This work has not been extended to CRC, and work framed by the        Trans-Theoretical Model's stages of change has also not been conducted in        the area.  The purpose of the proposed study is, therefore, to examine the       relationship of selected predisposing, reinforcing, and enabling factors on      stages of adoption of CRC screening (including Fecal Occult Blood                Testing/FOBT, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy).  Univariate              statistical techniques (correlations, ANOVA, t-test, Chi Square) will be         utilized to examine relationships among predisposing, enabling, and              reinforcing factors, and stage of CRC screening adoption.
