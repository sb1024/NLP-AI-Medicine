"Elucidating the role of alternative polyadenylation in alcohol related phenotypes using a novel trans-omics computational approach Alcohol consumption is an etiologic essential for the development of alcohol use disorder and many alcohol pathologies. Despite evidence that genetic variations contribute to alcohol consumption, the genetic architecture remains poorly characterized. In terms of the genetic component, individual susceptibility to complex traits such as alcohol consumption arise mainly from variation in gene regulation. It has become increasingly clear in recent years that alternative polyadenylation (APA) – a mechanism by which a single gene encodes multiple RNA isoforms with different polyadenylation (polyA) sites – is extensively used to modulate gene regulation. An improved understanding of the genetic causes of predisposition to alcohol-related problems will facilitate a precision medicine approach through better prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.  Yet shortcomings in current methods for concurrent APA identification and RNA transcript quantitation in high-throughput short read RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) studies have limited our ability to study its genetic contributions to alcohol-related phenotypes. To remedy this, a novel trans-omics method and related software will be developed here that can precisely identify expressed polyA sites and accurately quantify individual isoforms including APA transcripts from a sequenced RNA-Seq library. Specifically, a supervised machine learning algorithm will be built that utilizes both RNA-Seq data and DNA sequence indicators to predict the locations of expressed polyA sites (Aim 1). The “use-all-data” approach will identify and quantify APA isoforms present in the data with greater precision than current, one-dimensional omics techniques. Furthermore, the algorithm will be designed for integration into existing bioinformatics pipelines for quantitation along with other RNA species (Aim 2).  To determine the influence of APA on the genetic predisposition to alcohol consumption, a systems genetics approach will be applied to relate brain RNA expression of the APA isoforms and other RNA molecules, including protein-coding, long non-coding, and microRNA (miRNA) transcripts, to alcohol consumption measures in a two-bottle choice paradigm (Aim 3). From this approach, if and how APA influences gene networks and susceptibility to miRNA regulation, what genetic factors control APA, and how APA may influence alcohol consumption can be evaluated.  An extensive fellowship training plan and a team of mentors with diverse skillsets will be utilized to accomplish the multidisciplinary research project. The result of this training will be an alcohol researcher with not only the latest bioinformatics and computational skills but also the knowledge and experience to interpret, refine, and improve these models in the context of alcohol research. By following a training plan that incorporates the best of both disciplines, this proposal will be an example of a new type of alcohol researcher that can harness big data in a disease relevant way. Understanding the role of alternative polyadenylation (APA) in alcohol-related phenotypes and pathologies will provide important insights into biological mechanisms related to alcohol for improved diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of alcohol-related problems. The proposed research will study the association of APA with a predisposition for free-choice alcohol consumption using a novel trans-omics computational approach.",Elucidating the role of alternative polyadenylation in alcohol related phenotypes using a novel trans-omics computational approach,10073326,F31AA027430,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Adopted', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Fabry Disease', 'Facioscapulohumeral', 'Fellowship', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Hypertrophy', 'Heterogeneity', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Inbreeding', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metachromatic Leukodystrophy', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear Export', 'Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Polyadenylation', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Sequences', 'Rattus', 'Recombinants', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'alcohol prevention', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cohort', 'consumption measures', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'genetic architecture', 'improved', 'insight', 'mRNA Stability', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'skills', 'software development', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment strategy', 'user-friendly']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,F31,2020,31756,292134808,0.17524878863531482
"A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Project Summary This request for a renewal of funding is in response to the NIH/NIAAA funding opportunity entitled, “Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)” (RFA-AA-17-007). The overarching aim of the current proposal is to develop, validate, and implement clinically novel and innovative measurement tools to accurately identify children who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. The proposed study is relevant to the overall objective of the CIFASD funding opportunity “to accelerate specific areas of research related to the translation of new or improved capabilities in FASD clinical case recognition.” This is critical need. While there has been a concerted research effort since the initial clinical delineation of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), understanding the full spectrum of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure remains incomplete, hindering effective intervention. Although individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure may experience significantly impairing functional difficulties, identification of these individuals is inadequate. High rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis result in lost opportunities for intervention and misunderstanding of the etiology of observed difficulties. Development of accurate and specific identification tools will improve diagnostic capability and clinical decision-making regarding treatment. To this end, during previous funding periods we substantially enhanced the understanding of the specificity of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure to increase identification of alcohol-affected youth. Our hierarchical CIFASD Decision Tree, developed and validated on over 800 subjects, indicates that administration of just 4 measures can distinguish alcohol-affected youth from nonexposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions with accuracy rates of >80%. While a significant step forward, the Decision Tree was developed and validated in a research sample with a high risk of alcohol effects. One aim of the current proposal is to develop and test an electronic version of the Decision Tree (the eTree) in lower risk, international, population-based, and clinic-based samples. Another aim of the proposal, in line with the specific RFA goal to use innovative technologies to screen for dysmorphology and/or neurobehavioral deficits to aid in the identification of alcohol-exposed individuals, is the development and implementation of the FASD Online Neurobehavioral Screen (FONS), a web-based neurobehavioral assessment tool for use with subjects recruited via a web portal (cf. Foroud U01). The FONS will measure domains known to be affected in FASD, including those represented in diagnostic criteria for neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE). The eTree and the FONS will be validated using laboratory-based in-person neuropsychological assessment of children with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure and non-exposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions. The results of the proposed research will fulfill our research goals, improve recruitment, and most importantly accurately identify individuals affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, leading to improved clinical diagnosis and intervention. Project Narrative This project is directly relevant to public health concerns related to the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and improved identification of alcohol-affected individuals with novel electronic data collection techniques. Improved identification methods and delineation of features related to alcohol-exposure will ultimately lead to improved treatment and help alleviate the public health burden associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.",A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,10025101,U01AA014834,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'California', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neuropsychology', 'Online Systems', 'Outpatients', 'Persons', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Administration', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Ukraine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Youth', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'classification trees', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'effective intervention', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'first grade', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'mobile application', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'novel', 'population based', 'recruit', 'response', 'tool', 'web portal']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,39814,35319116,0.30541214109542386
"Developing a mobile alcohol biosensor platform for use in medication testing research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This mentored patient-oriented research career development award (K23) will enable Dr. Roberts to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinical researcher working to develop pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorder (AUD). This proposal outlines a 5-year training plan that supports a research program focused on developing a mobile biosensor platform for tracking medication effects on alcohol reactivity in ambulating outpatients. Training domains include 1) mobile biosensor assessment of alcohol use, 2) management and analysis of biosensor data, and 3) AUD pharmacotherapy development research. The training plan includes a strategic combination of mentor-led trainings; coursework in mobile health sensing, data science, statistics, bioethics, clinical research methods, and grant writing; attendance at relevant conferences and workshops; and collaboration with investigators conducting research in AUD pharmacotherapy development. The candidate will complete these training activities while completing a research program aimed at developing a mobile biosensor platform that can passively track alcohol consumption and deliver conditional assessments at key points during drinking episodes. In these preliminary studies, heavy drinkers with AUD will wear the mobile biosensors and receive alcohol in the laboratory. In Experiment 1, participants will receive two fixed doses of alcohol while wearing the biosensors and responding to prompted assessments. Goals of this experiment will be to 1) refine the machine-learning derived detection algorithms that will identify key points during drinking episodes and 2) evaluate the user experience and feasibility of delivering prompted assessments on a smartphone during drinking episodes. Experiment 2 will test the detection algorithms in a separate sample of freely behaving participants engaged in self-paced alcohol drinking. Results of these studies will serve as pilot data to support an R-mechanism application to develop a formal paradigm using the biosensor platform to track medication effects of alcohol use and reactivity in ambulating outpatients. Dr. Roberts has assembled an mentorship committee of leaders in the field. Dr. McKee (primary mentor) is a Professor of Psychiatry at the Yale University. She applies innovative laboratory paradigms to AUD pharmacotherapy development research, and she has several lines of research using mobile health biosensors to track substance use behavior. Dr. Ramchandani (primary co-mentor) is a clinical investigator and Chief of the Human Psychopharmacology Section at the NIAAA intramural research program. He will lead Dr. Roberts's training in alcohol pharmacokinetics. Drs. Gueorguieva, Petrakis, and Gerstein will serve as secondary mentors and contribute to Dr. Roberts's training in longitudinal data analysis, AUD pharmacotherapy clinical trials, and machine learning and data science, respectively. Drs. Miranda and Barnett will serve as external advisers and support Dr. Roberts's training in ambulatory assessment in the context of medication development research and transdermal alcohol detection, respectively. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcohol use disorder is a potentially disabling disease with a large economic and health burden in the United States. This proposal furthers public health interests by providing important training opportunities to an early- career clinical investigator interested in developing medication to treat alcohol use disorder.

"Applying Machine Learning in the Prediction and Identification of Children Affected by Prenatal Alcohol Exposure Project summary Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which are caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, occur in up to 5% of the population in the United States, and are associated with lifelong disability. There are multiple difficulties in obtaining an accurate diagnosis of FASD, including subtlety of physical features and heterogeneity in presentation. Consequently, FASD is grossly under-recognized, and the majority of affected children never receive a diagnosis. If FASD could be diagnosed earlier and with more reliability, many years of beneficial intervention would not be lost. The objective of this research is to apply machine learning to high-dimensional data in well-characterized data sets to predict or characterize children with FASD. The central hypothesis of this research is that the application of machine learning will accurately predict and recognize FASD compared with expert clinical diagnosis. To test this hypothesis, machine learning will be employed to: 1) characterize FASD based on the presence of non-cardinal malformations, 2) establish multivariate predictors of FASD in preschool aged children, and 3) identify diagnosis specific neurodevelopmental markers that distinguish alcohol related neurodevelopmental deficits from neurodevelopmental deficits without prenatal exposure. Two secondary data sources will be used in this proposal; a prospective study of 400 pregnant women and their offspring in Ukraine (half of whom consumed high amounts of alcohol) with full clinical evaluations for FASD, and a cross- sectional study of over 2,900 first grade children in four regions of the U.S., all with clinical FASD evaluations. Upon successful completion of the proposed research, the expected contribution is for more accurate prediction and recognition of children with FASD. The proposed research is innovative, as it represents a departure from current practice by incorporating machine learning techniques into predictive models of FASD. As a perinatal epidemiologist, I have a strong foundation in analytic techniques, and the advanced training in machine learning will further enhance these skills. Additionally, the disease-focused training in dysmorphology and neurodevelopment will provide a strong foundation to make significant contributions to the field of FASD research. Finally, training and mentoring in grant writing and the responsible conduct of research will provide a strong foundation to transition to an independent researcher. This proposed research builds on previous NIAAA funded research by my interdisciplinary mentoring team, who are all strongly supportive of this research and training plan. This seminal application of machine learning to FASD research will demonstrate its capacity to predict and identify affected children, ultimately leading to earlier intervention of children prenatally exposed to alcohol. Narrative Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are common and result in lifelong disabilities; however, they are clini- cally difficult to identify, and the vast majority of children with FASD are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. The proposed research will leverage recent advances in machine learning to better identify children with FASD. These advances would lead to earlier identification and intervention in the lives of children prenatally exposed to alcohol, which can improve their developmental outcomes.",Applying Machine Learning in the Prediction and Identification of Children Affected by Prenatal Alcohol Exposure,10018803,K01AA027811,"['Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'Nursery Schools', 'Nutritional', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Ukraine', 'United States', 'Writing', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aged', 'alcohol exposure', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'disability', 'fetal diagnosis', 'first grade', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malformation', 'multidimensional data', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel strategies', 'offspring', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'research clinical testing', 'responsible research conduct', 'skills', 'sociodemographics', 'success']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K01,2020,172808,524978793,0.22420348643819302
"Leveraging electronic health records to identify risky alcohol use prior to surgery Project Summary/Abstract Patients who consume more than two drinks a day prior to elective surgery are at increased risk of experiencing a myriad of surgical complications, readmissions, and prolonged hospital stays. Fortunately, short-term pre-operative abstinence from alcohol mitigates many surgical risks, and carefully timed interventions can prevent complications and alcohol withdrawal syndrome. However, implementation of pre- operative alcohol interventions requires accurate identification of patients with risky alcohol use at least four weeks prior to surgery. Pre-operative clinics frequently fail to screen for alcohol use or do so too close to the surgery date to allow time for intervention. Electronic health records (EHRs) offer an unprecedented amount of accessible clinical data that can be leveraged to identify risky alcohol use early in the surgical episode of care. Innovative methods are needed to identify data elements and create algorithms to capture risky alcohol use from structured and unstructured EHR data. Natural language processing (NLP) and other machine learning (ML)-based approaches are best suited to extract and analyze alcohol-related clinical narratives, and to synthesize heterogeneous alcohol-related data through computer-assisted methods. The proposed study will leverage EHR data to identify and characterize risky alcohol use among surgical patients to identify cohorts who could benefit from pre-operative alcohol intervention. The study aims are to: 1) develop an electronic, automated computable phenotype to classify risky alcohol use prior to surgery using NLP and ML; 2) validate the algorithm through prospective data collection; and 3) longitudinally evaluate the association between risky alcohol use phenotypes and adverse surgical outcomes including complications and hospital readmissions. Innovative applications of NLP and ML will support evaluation of unstructured EHR data (e.g. clinical notes) and will enable integration of heterogeneous alcohol use data to create the computable phenotype. The aims will be achieved through collaboration of experts in key clinical domains and advanced methodologies. This study will create and validate the first alcohol-specific phenotype-based algorithm for surgical patients, which will support future clinical applications and research into alcohol-related surgical interventions and health outcomes. Study outcomes are expected to have immediate value for identifying cohorts for future implementation research and lead to a new clinical tool for surgical clinics. Project Narrative Risky alcohol use is one of the most common risk factors for surgical complications among elective surgical patients. This study will develop an automated computable phenotype to classify risky alcohol use prior to surgery using electronic health record data, and longitudinally evaluate the association between risky alcohol use and adverse surgical outcomes. Accurate and early identification of patients is needed to implement critical pre-operative alcohol interventions.",Leveraging electronic health records to identify risky alcohol use prior to surgery,9953526,R21AA028315,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol withdrawal syndrome', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Computer Assisted', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Postoperative Period', 'Precision Health', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Surgical complication', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'alcohol abstinence', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol screening', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'care episode', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'computable phenotypes', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'direct application', 'early alcohol use', 'experience', 'health care service', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phosphatidylethanol', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'structured data', 'surgery outcome', 'surgical risk', 'tool', 'unstructured data']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2020,199125,641965656,0.17088403186811346
"Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure Abstract As a constitutent component of CIFASD4, this project will focus on earlier detection of the neurofacial effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four topics of the Request for Application (RFA) will be targeted: a) improved FAS/FASD facial recognition through 3D photography and computer analyses in individuals of different age groups; b) the utility of prenatal ultrasound as a screening or diagnostic modality; c) 3D facial imaging during the neonatal period to detect more subtle facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure; d) innovative uses of technologies, including handheld devices with apps, to screen for dysmorphology. Previously, we have implemented methods and associated software for analyzing postnatal face shape for the detection of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Although effective in their accuracy, they rely on the use of expensive and relatively clumsy 3D cameras for which not insignificant training is required. New methods of 2D image analysis are available, mobile device acquisition of 3D images is imminent and online recruitment to clinical research is becoming more common place. Finally, state-of-the-art machine learning methods are proving effective in large-scale analysis of ultrasound and MRI data. To accomplish our goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Automated screening of facial images for effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with potential for on-line and  mobile device use and integration of genetic, behavioral and cognitive data; 2. Fetal ultrasound analysis to detect facial, cranial and neural effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with  neonatal follow-up; 3. Algorithm and software development to improve current analysis of face-brain-alcohol interactions. Achieving aim 1 will dramatically impact access to validated facial screening for prenatal alcohol exposure. Successful demonstration of aim 2 will achieve the earliest possible diagnosis enabling further research on interventions but also anticipatory neonatal management. Progress in aim 3 will enhance face-brain morphometric analyses in collaboration with other CIFASD partners (U01:Parnell/Eberhart, U01:Wozniak). We will work collaboratively with consortium partners who will recruit subjects and provide facial and ultrasound images (U01: Chambers; U01: Coles; U01: Mattson; U01: Weinberg; U01: Wozniak). We will co- operate on the analysis of images arising from basic science partners focusing on the use of animal models. We will rely on research resources for validation of postnatal screening tools (R24 Dysmorphology - Jones) and online/app development and data management (R24 Informatics - Barnett). Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop new methods for screening for the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. It will exploit the wide availability and convenience of smartphone and tablet devices to detect the facial effects in children and adults and new ways of analyzing ultrasound images to detect facial and brain effects in the fetus. Our aim is to establish earlier detection so as to allow earlier intervention to improve outcome.",Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure,9927955,U01AA014809,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', '3D ultrasound', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caucasians', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cephalic', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Fetus', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Neonatal', 'Nose', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pregnancy', 'Preparation', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Syndrome', 'Tablet Computer', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'age group', 'alcohol exposure', 'algorithm development', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'caudate nucleus', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data management', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'handheld equipment', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'mouse model', 'neonatal period', 'novel', 'operation', 'postnatal', 'potential biomarker', 'prenatal', 'prenatal testing', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'software development', 'tobacco exposure']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD,U01,2020,234498,1496025,0.2218388787160567
"Alcohol Misuse: An Independent Risk Factor that Increases the Incidence and Severity of COVID-19 ABSTRACT The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in unprecedented morbidity and mortality. Risk factors like age, obesity, and comorbidity impact the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of COVID- 19 leading to hospital ICU admission and death. Additional risk factors that promote exaggerated immune and inflammatory response to the virus leading to severe disease or death must exist. One such risk factor could be alcohol consumption because: (1) Alcohol is the most frequently used drug in the United States. (2) Patients hospitalized for pneumonia who have an alcohol use disorder (AUD) are at greater risk for developing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) (the primary cause of death in COVID-19) than non-AUD patients; and (3) Alcohol negatively impacts function of the immune system and results in an inappropriate response to pathogens (a primary mechanism of severe COVID-19 and ARDS); and (4) Alcohol disrupts the intestinal microbiome (dysbiosis) and intestinal and lung barriers which can both further promote inflammation and contribute to ARDS. Accordingly, we hypothesize that alcohol misuse is an independent risk factor that increases the incidence and severity of COVID-19 by promoting exaggerated and dysregulated immune- inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2. We will leverage our COVID-19 data and biorepository at Rush University Medical Center (RUMC), which has tested over 22,000 patients (68% minority) with over 6000 patients testing positive, over 1000 hospitalized, over 600 critically ill. Currently, all patients arriving at RUMC are screened for alcohol use with AUDIT. Our COVID-19 biorepository has banked nasopharyngeal swabs, serum/plasma, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We will address the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Determine if alcohol use or misuse increases severity of COVID-19 and elucidate interactions with other risk factors. In this cross sectional study, we will use a machine learning classifier to determine if increased alcohol use/misuse are associated with more severe clinical presentation and poorer COVID-19 health outcomes (in 12,000 RUMC, 6000 COVID-19+) patients. Aim 2. Determine the impact of alcohol use and misuse on COVID-19 disease course and the impact of COVID-19 on alcohol consumption. In this longitudinal study, we will conduct longitudinal analysis of alcohol use in 6000 patients positive for COVID-19 to determine: (2a) if alcohol use/misuse is associated with slower recovery from COVID-19-associated symptoms. Aim 3. Determine if alcohol misuse results in exaggerated immune-inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and more organ dysfunction in COVID-19 patients and explore the mechanisms. In this mechanistic Aim, we will compare COVID-19 patients with different disease severity to determine if alcohol misuse is associated with: (3a) altered immune/inflammatory response. (3b) disrupted intestinal barrier integrity. We will use machine learning and other advanced informatics approaches to investigate these Aims to discover new mechanisms for alcohol-COVID-19 interactions for prevention and therapeutic targets for COVID-19. NARRATIVE The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed and threatens our society. However we know very little about the underlying mechanisms and comorbidities that cause severe symptoms in some COVID-19 patients. Alcohol use has been shown to make the flu and other respiratory diseases worse and we think this may be true for COVID-19 and alcohol as well. This study will investigate if alcohol use makes COVID-19 worse and how.

"Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria Project Summary: FASD is a serious public health crisis with 80,000 to 120,000 U.S. pregnancies per year at high risk. FASD diagnostic clinics are very sparse, difficult to sustain because of diagnostic complexity, unable to meet demand, and plagued by disagreement about diagnostic criteria. A recent comparison of five FASD diagnostic systems acknowledged that the lack of objective biomarkers for prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) contributes to disagreement in the field. The goal of the proposed work is to develop and refine neuroimaging methods capable of identifying subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE. A critical component of this project will be to apply these refined neuroimaging “biomarkers” to examine the validity and performance of the most commonly-used FASD diagnostic criteria (alcohol exposure, dysmorphology, growth, and cognition). The proposed project will push the development of imaging methods and will also include an examination of the sensitivity and specificity of current diagnostic factors. The aims are: 1) perform a comprehensive characterization of the FASD “connectome” using state-of- the-art Human Connectome Project (HCP) methods in children with PAE, 2) evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of FASD diagnostic criteria to provide objective evaluation of FASD criteria (which remain in flux), 3) characterize relationships between connectomics and cognitive functioning, & 4) examine the developmental course of functional connectivity, white matter connectivity, cortical gyrification, and intra-cortical myelin. Participants will undergo longitudinal re-assessment at 15-months to match the new HCP-development paradigm (HCP-D) to allow for comparison to a large normative dataset being collected in Minnesota as part of the HCP-D project. We will capitalize on the developments spawned from the $40 million HCP and will benefit from evaluating the brains of children with PAE against the backdrop of a very large HCP normative dataset (n=1300). The proposed study will examine 45 participants with PAE and 45 matched controls, ages 8-16, all of whom will be evaluated by the CIFASD dysmorphology project. Participants will undergo MRI scans at the University of Minnesota's Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) at baseline and again 15 months later. The imaging protocol, which contains very high resolution structural, diffusion- weighted, and fMRI scans will evaluate cortical gyrification, intra-cortical myelin, white matter connectivity, and functional connectivity. Data from the HCP-D project will be used as secondary “normative” comparison dataset. We expect to find a number of subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE that have not previously been observed and we will characterize individuals with these metrics. Individual identification of neurodevelopmental anomalies will then allow us to probe the screening properties of commonly used FASD diagnostic criteria and to test the performance of Dr. Mattson's Decision Tree model for rapidly identifying children with developmental effects of PAE. The study will have direct implications for FASD clinical practice and public policies as it will provide objective data about the relative advantages and disadvantages of individual diagnostic elements and it will allow for comparisons of competing FASD diagnostic systems. The proposed project aims to use the most advanced MRI brain imaging techniques available to address a highly practical problem faced by clinicians and public health officials: the lack of consensus about diagnostic criteria for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and the challenges of identifying individuals who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) but do not have the physical characteristics upon which a diagnosis can be made. The proposed study will identify subtle brain anomalies in children with PAE with a level of sensitivity not previously attainable. The study will push forward our understanding of how PAE negatively affects the efficiency of the brain's networks. In addition, the study will use these brain imaging results to further refine the diagnostic criteria such that more children will be able to be properly identified as having a neurodevelopmental disorder as a result of PAE.",Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria,9940992,U01AA026102,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Factor', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dysmorphology', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Myelin', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'connectome', 'diffusion weighted', 'executive function', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'negative affect', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'performance tests', 'prisma', 'processing speed', 'screening', 'white matter']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,U01,2020,344735,340417756,0.18941862784923486
"3/3 Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV - Intervention Research Arm (ARCH-IRA) Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs) and hazardous drinking are the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the US and are responsible for 10% of all deaths among working age adults. Among Persons Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH), heavy alcohol use is up to twice the rate in the general population. Few people engage in behavioral alcohol treatment and alcohol pharmacotherapies are not routinely used as part of alcohol treatment, despite the known efficacy of these interventions. PLWH engaged in treatment for their HIV disease have regular contact with a medical provider and are treated in a medical home model in which all medical services are delivered within HIV clinics, but few HIV providers feel comfortable treating AUDs. During our initial funding period, we implemented routine alcohol screening, developed a computerized brief intervention (CBI), and conducted provider training on alcohol pharmacotherapies. However, while we found a strong impact from routine screening with CBI for reducing alcohol use, few providers prescribed alcohol pharmacotherapy, despite this specialized training, with most indicating continued discomfort and lack of knowledge for use of pharmacotherapy. Algorithms are used routinely to guide providers in treatment selection for many different disorders that are not within their specialty such as diabetes management, obesity, arthritis, and other disorders. In addition, we tested the use of provider algorithms for the treatment of depression and smoking with PLWH and demonstrated increased utilization of these medications. For this renewal, we are proposing an implementation science test of using an algorithm that will build upon our success with CBI and integrate alcohol pharmacotherapies and other behavioral therapies within routine treatment. A decision-tree algorithm that provides more intensive treatments, including alcohol pharmacotherapies, that is also responsive to comorbidities such as depressive or anxiety symptoms will be tested in three HIV clinics across CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS). Primary outcomes include reduced alcohol consumption and frequency, improved HIV outcomes, and improvement in comorbid conditions. We will also examine provider, staff, patient, and clinic-level facilitators and barriers to implementation of this algorithm in routine clinical care. Successful implementation of this treatment approach would have considerable impact on reducing AUDs among PLWH and could be integrated within existing electronic health record systems for a sustainable model of alcohol treatment delivery to other HIV clinics. Hazardous alcohol use is the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the United States and is up to twice as high among PLWH. Algorithms have been developed to increase the efficacy of the treatment of chronic diseases with tremendous success but have never been empirically tested to aid in alcohol use disorders (AUDs). We propose to test an algorithm developed to aid providers in selecting behavioral and pharmacotherapy for the treatment of AUDs for PLWH engaged in care.",3/3 Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV - Intervention Research Arm (ARCH-IRA),10003109,U01AA020802,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Achievement', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Arthritis', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Trees', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Geography', 'HIV', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Home environment', 'Hypertension', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Maintenance', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol screening', 'alcohol services', 'alcohol use disorder', 'anxiety symptoms', 'arm', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brief alcohol intervention', 'brief intervention', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'comorbid depression', 'comorbidity', 'computerized', 'consumption measures', 'depressive symptoms', 'diabetes management', 'drinking', 'evidence base', 'hazardous drinking', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'preventable death', 'primary outcome', 'reduced alcohol use', 'routine screening', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'transmission process', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,U01,2020,347377,325573502,0.09430229952726572
"Administrative Core of the CIFASD Project Summary/Abstract The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is a multidisciplinary, international consortium of research projects and resource cores charged with improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD. The Administrative Resource Core of the CIFASD (AdminC) has led this consortium since it was first established in 2003 and plays a critical leadership role in the coordination of research efforts and ensuring progress toward consortium goals. CIFASD addresses issues related to prenatal alcohol exposure across the lifespan, using a range of interrelated clinical and preclinical research approaches. This iteration of the consortium consists of multiple collaborative components including four resource U24 cores (AdminC, Dysmorphology, Informatics, and Outreach/Dissemination), nine U01 research projects (clinical, basic science, and/or translational) and two exploratory/developmental UH2 projects. One goal of the CIFASD is to improve identification of individuals who have been affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. This will be accomplished by assessing biomarkers, such as immune and miRNA profiles, and by using neuroimaging techniques that may be more sensitive to subtle pathology seen in individuals who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for FAS. In addition, CIFASD will develop novel tools, such as 3D facial and neurobehavioral screening, which can be assessed remotely and made more universally accessible through eHealth. The use of telemedicine will also provide access to more detailed dysmorphology evaluations. Another goal is to identify risk and resiliency factors, including genetic influences that will help with understanding the mechanisms of alcohol's damaging effects and also lead to more targeted interventions. A third goal is to better understand the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on consequences across the lifespan, including adulthood. Finally, an intervention for improving outcomes will be modified to a mobile platform, so that it can reach larger populations of individuals with FASD and their families. Collectively, these projects have the potential for moving the FASD field forward, improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD and serving a wide audience with the technologies available in eHealth. The Specific Aims of the AdminC are to: 1) Provide scientific and administrative direction, leadership and oversight to CIFASD; 2) Facilitate communication among the various projects and the dissemination of results; 3) Assist with data management strategies; 4) Provide annual evaluations of progress; and 5) Provide assistance to projects with implementing eHealth technology. The AdminC provides the foundation for the interactive and supportive framework of CIFASD by establishing regular communications with all members through monthly conference calls and biannual meetings; leading the Steering Committee in the establishment and implementation of CIFASD priorities and policies; supporting the Science Advisory Board with its evaluations of progress on each component as well as the overall mission of CIFASD; as well as serving as the liaison between the consortium's project scientists and its NIAAA advisors. Project Narrative The consequences resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure are wide-ranging and a major and costly public health problem. The goal of the CIFASD consortium is to enhance the identification and treatment of FASD utilizing a multidisciplinary approach consisting of both basic science and clinical research. The collaborations among research projects will allow CIFASD to improve the diagnosis and treatment of FASD, moving the field forward in ways that could not be easily achieved by individual projects.",Administrative Core of the CIFASD,9940986,U24AA014811,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Charge', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Dissemination', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Physical assessment', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Progress Reports', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'data management', 'diagnostic screening', 'drinking', 'eHealth', 'epidemiology study', 'fetal', 'forging', 'health care service', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'meetings', 'member', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outreach', 'pre-clinical research', 'program dissemination', 'recruit', 'repository', 'resilience', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web site']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U24,2020,428830,35319116,0.255405033602727
"A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Project Summary This request for a renewal of funding is in response to the NIH/NIAAA funding opportunity entitled, “Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)” (RFA-AA-17-007). The overarching aim of the current proposal is to develop, validate, and implement clinically novel and innovative measurement tools to accurately identify children who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. The proposed study is relevant to the overall objective of the CIFASD funding opportunity “to accelerate specific areas of research related to the translation of new or improved capabilities in FASD clinical case recognition.” This is critical need. While there has been a concerted research effort since the initial clinical delineation of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), understanding the full spectrum of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure remains incomplete, hindering effective intervention. Although individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure may experience significantly impairing functional difficulties, identification of these individuals is inadequate. High rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis result in lost opportunities for intervention and misunderstanding of the etiology of observed difficulties. Development of accurate and specific identification tools will improve diagnostic capability and clinical decision-making regarding treatment. To this end, during previous funding periods we substantially enhanced the understanding of the specificity of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure to increase identification of alcohol-affected youth. Our hierarchical CIFASD Decision Tree, developed and validated on over 800 subjects, indicates that administration of just 4 measures can distinguish alcohol-affected youth from nonexposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions with accuracy rates of >80%. While a significant step forward, the Decision Tree was developed and validated in a research sample with a high risk of alcohol effects. One aim of the current proposal is to develop and test an electronic version of the Decision Tree (the eTree) in lower risk, international, population-based, and clinic-based samples. Another aim of the proposal, in line with the specific RFA goal to use innovative technologies to screen for dysmorphology and/or neurobehavioral deficits to aid in the identification of alcohol-exposed individuals, is the development and implementation of the FASD Online Neurobehavioral Screen (FONS), a web-based neurobehavioral assessment tool for use with subjects recruited via a web portal (cf. Foroud U01). The FONS will measure domains known to be affected in FASD, including those represented in diagnostic criteria for neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE). The eTree and the FONS will be validated using laboratory-based in-person neuropsychological assessment of children with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure and non-exposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions. The results of the proposed research will fulfill our research goals, improve recruitment, and most importantly accurately identify individuals affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, leading to improved clinical diagnosis and intervention. Project Narrative This project is directly relevant to public health concerns related to the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and improved identification of alcohol-affected individuals with novel electronic data collection techniques. Improved identification methods and delineation of features related to alcohol-exposure will ultimately lead to improved treatment and help alleviate the public health burden associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.",A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,9940985,U01AA014834,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'California', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neuropsychology', 'Online Systems', 'Outpatients', 'Persons', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Administration', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Ukraine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Youth', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'classification trees', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'effective intervention', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'first grade', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'mobile application', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'novel', 'population based', 'recruit', 'response', 'tool', 'web portal']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,444752,35319116,0.30541214109542386
"Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children Maternal substance use disorders are a substantial public health concern and the neurological consequences of prenatal exposure are a major threat to the long-term health of offspring. Globally, prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is between 2-7 and 20-50 per 1000, respectively. By contrast, in certain high-risk communities in South Africa, prevalence is reported to be as high as 63 and 155 per 1000, respectively. Though prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is known to affect the central nervous system, to date, little data exists in respect of the impact of PAE in early childhood, before both higher-level brain networks are established and other potentially confounding post- natal environmental influences have come into play. For neurodevelopmental disorders, studies have consistently shown that early intervention, based on detection and targeted interventions, leads to better long-term outcomes. We aim to address this precise gap in knowledge by imaging the brain and 3D face across the FASD continuum to investigate early biomarkers, trajectories and functional correlates of PAE in a cohort followed prospectively from birth to age 6 years. Data: Our cohort includes a well characterized subsample of children (PAE and healthy controls) enrolled in the Drakenstein Child Health Study in Cape Town, South Africa, who have been scanned as neonates and at 2-3 years of age. Preliminary published data shows highly significant relationships between PAE and regional gray and white matter changes, already discernible in newborns, well before the age FASD is typically diagnosed. An additional longitudinal assessment at 6-years will yield a unique FASD sample with 3 distinct time points (infants, toddlers and children), allowing characterization of brain and face morphology and brain structure and function in this previously understudied early developmental period. This proposal addresses fundamental gaps concerning the presence, timing and regional specificity of altered brain morphology and structural and functional connectivity in association with the effects of PAE on the developing brain from birth to 6 years, and the relationships with facial dysmorphology. The research team has successfully gathered data from the proposed cohort as neonates and at 2–3 years of age. The benefits of extending this research to a subsequent imaging time-point, with a larger range of developmental and neurobehavioral assessments, provides an unprecedented opportunity to determine longitudinal effects of PAE on the trajectory of the developing brain in these critical early years, the links between neural and face predictors of PAE and the long-term clinical significance of these findings. This research will illuminate early neurodevelopmental mechanisms leading to subsequent behavioral and neurological disturbances, which may allow opportunities for targeting interventions when brain plasticity is still relatively fluid. This project might also lead to new strategies for early diagnosis using both face and brain biomarkers. Project Narrative Fetal exposure of the brain to alcohol can trigger brain abnormalities that unfold over a lifetime with severe consequences both for the affected individual and for society at large. To date, these brain abnormalities and associated deficits and behaviors have mostly been studied in late childhood or later, with very few studies following the consequences of well documented fetal alcohol exposure as they develop in the same individual across time in early childhood when the brain is most responsive to potential treatments. This project will extend an ongoing study of children with fetal alcohol exposure, already characterized as newborns and at age 2-3 to add assessments of the brain and behavior at age 6 and will explore alcohol-induced facial abnormalities as a complementary predictor of brain problems. !",Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children,9969289,R01AA026834,"['2 year old', '3 year old', '3-Dimensional', '6 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Neonatal', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'alcohol exposure', 'antenatal', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data fusion', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'efficacy testing', 'fetal diagnosis', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal alcohol use', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'maternal depression', 'multimodality', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal exposure', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'shape analysis', 'statistics', 'white matter', 'white matter change']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,530736,673201228,0.1789814272503458
"Using Smartphone Assessments for Personalized Prediction of Problematic Alcohol Use PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Risky drinking, such as binge (5+/4+ drinks per 2-hour occasion for males/females) and high-intensity (2-3x the rates of binge) drinking, is highly prevalent among young adults and associated with severe acute and longer-term negative behavioral and health outcomes. However, given its prevalence, individuals who engage in such activities comprise a heterogeneous group. Researchers have had a hard time identifying the varied behavioral processes that are predictive of negative alcohol-related consequences and problematic trajectories across time. Predicting who will go on to develop lasting problems and whose risky alcohol use behavior is developmentally-limited is especially challenging. Part of the hindrance comes from the methods that are currently used to study this diverse behavior. In particular, researchers often use cross-sectional studies to look across individuals. While this has reaped invaluable knowledge regarding differences among individuals in their drinking patterns, it does not reveal the dynamic processes that contribute to maintaining such behaviors or make one more likely to have negative consequences. However, increasingly hypotheses pertain to these dynamic processes. This requires arriving at quantitative descriptions of individuals' emotional and behavioral processes. The science can move towards a more nuanced understanding of the varied mechanisms contributing to problematic alcohol use by arriving at valid descriptions of individual-level (i.e., personalized) processes. We propose to make advances towards personalized quantitative models in four ways: 1) develop an informed intensive longitudinal research design that enables acquisition of relevant variables across time on a daily basis and across the span of one year; 2) use innovative measurement technologies that enable objective assessment of contextual features related to drinking; 3) collect data using state-of-the-art phone applications that enable self-report and passive data collection where the user does not need to interface; and 4) implement cutting- edge machine learning algorithms that can reliably arrive at individual-level detection and predictive models that can be used as the foundation for future just-in-time adaptive interventions. We will accomplish this by enrolling N=300 young adult risky drinkers who will complete a 120-day ambulatory assessment protocol completing surveys on smartphones that are also equipped with passive sensors and applications, and then provide 4 waves of data on alcohol use and associated variables (e.g., consequences) over one year. In the end, our endeavors will create novel approaches to measuring and modeling behavioral processes related to high-risk drinking that capture the individuality of each participant. These endeavors will provide the framework for accurate detection and prediction of daily drinking and long-term problematic alcohol use trajectories that support future scientific and clinical efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Risky drinking behavior (i.e., episodic binge and high-intensity drinking), which peaks in young adulthood, is estimated to account for more than 40,000 deaths annually and over $167 Billion in economic costs in the United States. Young adult risky drinkers are a heterogeneous group, which makes them very difficult to study and to predict who will go on to develop lasting problems with alcohol use and alcohol use disorder. This research will implement cutting-edge machine learning techniques, and apply them to data collected from daily surveys and passive smartphone sensors in young adult risky drinkers to develop personalized models of problematic alcohol use.",Using Smartphone Assessments for Personalized Prediction of Problematic Alcohol Use,9973396,R01AA026879,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Bluetooth', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Individuality', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Models', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Series', 'Social Environment', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Vehicle crash', 'Violence', 'adaptive intervention', 'alcohol behavior', 'alcohol related consequences', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'bench to bedside', 'binge drinking', 'craving', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'economic cost', 'emotion regulation', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk drinking', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'mortality', 'multitask', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'positive emotional state', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'real time monitoring', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'social', 'social group', 'working group', 'young adult']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,606423,570146095,0.11234254860184148
"Identification of fetal alcohol-affected children: Alterations in imprinted gene expression and methylation as biomarkers of neurobehavioral and growth impairment. Abstract Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the most common preventable cause of neurodevelopmental disabilities, with prevalence estimates of 3-10/1000 individuals in the US and up to 80/1000 in endemic communities. The promise of an increasing number of interventions tailored to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE)-related neurobehavioral deficits is limited by diagnostic difficulties in clinical practice. Currently known biomarkers of exposure are neither sensitive nor specific for neurobehavioral deficits, in part because not all exposed children are affected. There is, therefore, a critical need for biomarkers of effect to identify affected children who would benefit from early, tailored therapeutic interventions. A growing body of literature has demonstrated alcohol-induced alterations in epigenetic programming as an important potential mechanism in FASD, suggesting that such alterations may serve as biomarkers of effect. Imprinted genes comprise a unique subset of epigenetically regulated genes that is sensitive to prenatal insults. There is considerable overlap between the neurobehavioral domains affected by FASD and those seen in experimental animal models of imprinted gene dysregulation, including learning, memory, and attachment. In a prenatally- recruited, prospective longitudinal cohort, we recently found that PAE was associated with alterations in placental level of expression of 11 of 93 expressed imprinted genes. Expression changes for five of these genes statistically mediated effects of alcohol on postnatal growth, identifying these alterations as biomarkers of fetal alcohol growth restriction. Given the remarkable overlap between the neurobehavioral domains affected in FASD and those affected by alteration of imprinted gene expression in animal models, alcohol-induced alterations in placental imprinted gene expression may also provide biomarkers for FASD neurocognitive deficits. Although most epigenetic marks are specific to tissue-type and timing of exposure, genomic imprinting maps and our pilot data indicate that markers of imprinted gene dysregulation identified in placental tissue may be detected in blood samples obtained at older ages. The aims of this study are: (1) To characterize the fetal alcohol-related imprintome signature in the placenta and in blood samples obtained at 6 yr; (2) To identify alterations in imprinted gene level of expression and ICR methylation that can serve as biomarkers of effect; (3) To validate findings in Aims 1 and 2 in blood samples from a 2nd, independent cohort. The data for this study will come from two prospective longitudinal cohorts recruited from the Cape Coloured community in Cape Town, South Africa, where the prevalence of FASD is among the highest in the world. Results from this study will make it possible to identify affected children who would benefit from early therapeutic interventions but would likely not be detected by current diagnostic tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite widespread public health advisories, alcohol use during pregnancy persists in the U.S. and worldwide, making fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) the most common preventable cause of neurodevelopmental delay. The promise of an ever-increasing number of interventions tailored to FASD deficits is limited by difficulties in identifying fetal alcohol-related facial dysmorphology in infancy and early childhood, when interventions are most effective, and in children with alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, in which neurodevelopmental impairment occurs in the absence of dysmorphic features. This proposal seeks to identify alterations in imprinted gene expression that can be used as biomarkers of adverse effect to identify infants and children with FASD who would benefit from therapeutic interventions but would probably not be detected by current diagnostic tools.",Identification of fetal alcohol-affected children: Alterations in imprinted gene expression and methylation as biomarkers of neurobehavioral and growth impairment.,10023145,R01AA027916,"['Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Growth', 'Growth Disorders', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methylation', 'Microcephaly', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Nursery Schools', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Placenta', 'Play', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'South Africa', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'alcohol effect', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'early childhood', 'fetal', 'fetal diagnosis', 'gene function', 'imprint', 'infancy', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'whole genome']",NIAAA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,632755,558628098,0.22434218814191523
"Fourth International Conference on Alcohol and Cancer ABSTRACT A contribution of alcohol to the development of several cancers, including esophageal, laryngeal, lung, breast (in women) and colorectal (especially in men), is becoming increasingly evident. Each year, 390,000 cases of cancer world-wide are attributable to alcohol consumption, representing 3.6% of all newly diagnosed cancers. The International Conference on Alcohol and Cancer (ICAC) was established in 2010 to complement the major research conferences in cancer (e.g. AACR) and alcohol (e.g., RSA, ISBRA, ESBRA) which do not have a focus on the role of alcohol in carcinogenesis. After the success of the first three meetings (in Heidelberg, Germany in 2011; Breckenridge, USA in 2013; and Crete, Greece in 2015), we are now in the process of organizing our fourth conference. The conferences have been successful in bringing together over fifty investigators (from sixteen nations) with cutting-edge and complementary expertise in alcohol and cancer. In addition to allowing experts to share their most current results, the conference has promoted interactions between basic scientists and clinicians in all major aspects of alcohol-induced carcinogenesis. In so doing, it has fostered the development of valuable new collaborations that promote major advances in the field. An important secondary function of this conference is to attract young scientists and graduate students into this important field of research. This R13 application seeks mostly travel support for new investigators, and pre- and post-doctoral trainees to allow attendance at the fourth ICAC to be held in Newport, Rhode Island, USA, on April 14-18, 2019. The conference will remain faithful to and build upon the previous conferences by achieving the following specific aims: i) provide a venue for the presentation of cutting-edge research in the field of alcohol and cancer; ii) promote the development of new ideas and research directions by fostering interactions and collaborations between researchers from a variety of sub-specialties and disciplines; iii) foster interactions between young investigators (including postgraduate and graduate students) and established investigators; iv) facilitate distribution of new scientific and translational information to the professional and lay communities, and v) disseminate the findings of the meeting to a wider audience by publishing the presentations. It is anticipated that these conferences will continue to enhance our understanding of the role played by alcohol in carcinogenesis and thereby facilitate the development of treatments that will prevent or treat cancers caused by alcohol. PROJECT NARRATIVE The contribution of alcohol to the development of a variety of cancers is becoming increasingly evident. The proposed meeting will focus on recent advances in epidemiology, molecular mechanisms and biomarkers of alcohol-induced carcinogenesis, and the emerging areas of systems approaches, big data, deep learning and artificial intelligence. As has been the case previously, this meeting will function as an ideal platform for promoting interactions between basic scientists and clinicians in all major aspects of alcohol-induced carcinogenesis. In addition, it will serve to attract young scientists and graduate students into this important field of research.",Fourth International Conference on Alcohol and Cancer,9771126,R13AA027725,"['Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'American Association of Cancer Research', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Collaborations', 'Colorectal', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Crete', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Endocrinologist', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Esophageal', 'Fostering', 'Germany', 'Greece', 'Inflammation', 'International', 'Larynx', 'Lung', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Molecular', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Oral', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Rhode Island', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'System', 'Travel', 'Woman', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer stem cell', 'cancer type', 'carcinogenesis', 'deep learning', 'graduate student', 'medical specialties', 'meetings', 'men', 'posters', 'pre-doctoral', 'prevent', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapy development']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R13,2019,30000,550947887,0.1635252422604886
"Elucidating the role of alternative polyadenylation in alcohol related phenotypes using a novel trans-omics computational approach Alcohol consumption is an etiologic essential for the development of alcohol use disorder and many alcohol pathologies. Despite evidence that genetic variations contribute to alcohol consumption, the genetic architecture remains poorly characterized. In terms of the genetic component, individual susceptibility to complex traits such as alcohol consumption arise mainly from variation in gene regulation. It has become increasingly clear in recent years that alternative polyadenylation (APA) – a mechanism by which a single gene encodes multiple RNA isoforms with different polyadenylation (polyA) sites – is extensively used to modulate gene regulation. An improved understanding of the genetic causes of predisposition to alcohol-related problems will facilitate a precision medicine approach through better prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.  Yet shortcomings in current methods for concurrent APA identification and RNA transcript quantitation in high-throughput short read RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) studies have limited our ability to study its genetic contributions to alcohol-related phenotypes. To remedy this, a novel trans-omics method and related software will be developed here that can precisely identify expressed polyA sites and accurately quantify individual isoforms including APA transcripts from a sequenced RNA-Seq library. Specifically, a supervised machine learning algorithm will be built that utilizes both RNA-Seq data and DNA sequence indicators to predict the locations of expressed polyA sites (Aim 1). The “use-all-data” approach will identify and quantify APA isoforms present in the data with greater precision than current, one-dimensional omics techniques. Furthermore, the algorithm will be designed for integration into existing bioinformatics pipelines for quantitation along with other RNA species (Aim 2).  To determine the influence of APA on the genetic predisposition to alcohol consumption, a systems genetics approach will be applied to relate brain RNA expression of the APA isoforms and other RNA molecules, including protein-coding, long non-coding, and microRNA (miRNA) transcripts, to alcohol consumption measures in a two-bottle choice paradigm (Aim 3). From this approach, if and how APA influences gene networks and susceptibility to miRNA regulation, what genetic factors control APA, and how APA may influence alcohol consumption can be evaluated.  An extensive fellowship training plan and a team of mentors with diverse skillsets will be utilized to accomplish the multidisciplinary research project. The result of this training will be an alcohol researcher with not only the latest bioinformatics and computational skills but also the knowledge and experience to interpret, refine, and improve these models in the context of alcohol research. By following a training plan that incorporates the best of both disciplines, this proposal will be an example of a new type of alcohol researcher that can harness big data in a disease relevant way. Understanding the role of alternative polyadenylation (APA) in alcohol-related phenotypes and pathologies will provide important insights into biological mechanisms related to alcohol for improved diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of alcohol-related problems. The proposed research will study the association of APA with a predisposition for free-choice alcohol consumption using a novel trans-omics computational approach.",Elucidating the role of alternative polyadenylation in alcohol related phenotypes using a novel trans-omics computational approach,9833879,F31AA027430,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Adopted', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Fabry Disease', 'Facioscapulohumeral', 'Fellowship', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Hypertrophy', 'Heterogeneity', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Inbreeding', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metachromatic Leukodystrophy', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear Export', 'Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Polyadenylation', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Sequences', 'Rattus', 'Recombinants', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'alcohol prevention', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cohort', 'consumption measures', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'genetic architecture', 'improved', 'insight', 'mRNA Stability', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'skills', 'software development', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment strategy', 'user-friendly']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,F31,2019,30732,292134808,0.17524878863531482
"Maternal circulating miRNA function in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Project Summary Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is the leading non-genetic cause of intellectual and other brain disabilities. However, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), estimated to affect ~2-5% of school-aged children in the US, remain difficult to diagnose and to prevent. Our recent work (PMCID 5102408) identified several circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) in heavy alcohol-consuming pregnant women whose expression levels in the 2nd and 3rd trimester predicted adverse infant outcomes including craniofacial anomalies and neurobehavioral and growth deficits1. Specifically, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) models identified 11 elevated plasma miRNAs in mothers whose infants were severely affected by alcohol consumption. Using Random Forest Analysis (RFA), we were further able to use a distinct group of miRNAs to classify infants apparently unaffected by ethanol exposure with affected infants as opposed to alcohol unexposed infants. Aside from their diagnostic value, it is unknown if these Maternal circulating miRNAs associated with Adverse Infant Outcomes (M-circmiRNA-aAIO) contribute to the developmental pathologies of FASD. Bioinformatic analysis suggests these circulating miRNAs potentially regulate important hub genes for STAT3 and ephrin signaling pathways, which are in turn known to control cycles of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) crucial for normal embryogenesis and placental and fetal development. Therefore, my overarching hypothesis is that PAE impairs early development by interfering with the endocrine action of circulating maternal miRNAs on both the placenta and fetus. In my research proposal, using both human cell lines and in vivo mouse models, I will test the hypothesis that pathogenic levels of circulating miRNAs mediate effects of ethanol on placenta and fetus and that they control embryo growth and survival by regulating EMT-like behaviors of key placental and fetal cells. The long-term goals of this project will be to develop interventional strategies that exploit the biology of endocrine circulating miRNAs in mitigating negative outcomes due to PAE and other teratogens. My immediate goals will be to define the role of maternal miRNAs, which predict FASD outcomes, on placental and embryo growth and development. Aim 1: Determine the impact of M-circmiRNA-aAIOs on trophoblast growth, survival, migration and invasion under basal and ethanol exposed conditions. Aim 2: Determine the impact of M-circmiRNA-aAIOs on embryonic growth, death, and cellular maturation/differentiation under basal and ethanol exposed conditions. Aim 3: Determine the impact of M-circmiRNA-aAIOs on in vivo fetal development and neonatal outcomes. My studies are expected to uncover novel endocrine and pregnancy related functions of FASD-associated maternal systemic miRNAs and may provide novel therapeutic targets and non-invasive modalities to mitigate effects of PAE. Given its translational potential, this project will further my training as a physician-scientist interested in pursuing both clinical duties and research on early developmental disorders. Project Narrative Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is the leading non-genetic cause of intellectual and other brain disabilities. This project seeks to characterize the endocrine function of maternal circulating microRNAs, predictive of adverse infant outcome following PAE, on the developing fetus and placenta. The goal of these studies is to uncover new therapeutic targets which can mitigate the effects of PAE and consequently prevent Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). This goal is consistent with the mission of the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, which is to find ways to ‘reduce alcohol-related problems’ by research in ‘prevention and treatment’.",Maternal circulating miRNA function in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,9638420,F31AA026505,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ectoderm', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endocrine', 'Endoderm', 'Ephrins', 'Epithelial', 'Ethanol', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Fetus', 'Germ Layers', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Mediating', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesoderm', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neuroectoderm', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Placenta', 'Placentation', 'Plasma', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'STAT3 gene', 'School-Age Population', 'Scientist', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Signal Pathway', 'Teratogens', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol related problem', 'base', 'circulating microRNA', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fetal', 'fetus cell', 'human female', 'human male', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'infant outcome', 'interest', 'loss of function', 'migration', 'mouse model', 'neonatal outcome', 'neurobehavioral', 'new therapeutic target', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'offspring', 'placental morphology', 'pregnant', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'stem cell biology', 'trophoblast', 'undergraduate research']",NIAAA,TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCE CTR,F31,2019,33461,25375098,0.20616953142525685
"A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Project Summary This request for a renewal of funding is in response to the NIH/NIAAA funding opportunity entitled, “Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)” (RFA-AA-17-007). The overarching aim of the current proposal is to develop, validate, and implement clinically novel and innovative measurement tools to accurately identify children who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. The proposed study is relevant to the overall objective of the CIFASD funding opportunity “to accelerate specific areas of research related to the translation of new or improved capabilities in FASD clinical case recognition.” This is critical need. While there has been a concerted research effort since the initial clinical delineation of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), understanding the full spectrum of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure remains incomplete, hindering effective intervention. Although individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure may experience significantly impairing functional difficulties, identification of these individuals is inadequate. High rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis result in lost opportunities for intervention and misunderstanding of the etiology of observed difficulties. Development of accurate and specific identification tools will improve diagnostic capability and clinical decision-making regarding treatment. To this end, during previous funding periods we substantially enhanced the understanding of the specificity of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure to increase identification of alcohol-affected youth. Our hierarchical CIFASD Decision Tree, developed and validated on over 800 subjects, indicates that administration of just 4 measures can distinguish alcohol-affected youth from nonexposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions with accuracy rates of >80%. While a significant step forward, the Decision Tree was developed and validated in a research sample with a high risk of alcohol effects. One aim of the current proposal is to develop and test an electronic version of the Decision Tree (the eTree) in lower risk, international, population-based, and clinic-based samples. Another aim of the proposal, in line with the specific RFA goal to use innovative technologies to screen for dysmorphology and/or neurobehavioral deficits to aid in the identification of alcohol-exposed individuals, is the development and implementation of the FASD Online Neurobehavioral Screen (FONS), a web-based neurobehavioral assessment tool for use with subjects recruited via a web portal (cf. Foroud U01). The FONS will measure domains known to be affected in FASD, including those represented in diagnostic criteria for neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE). The eTree and the FONS will be validated using laboratory-based in-person neuropsychological assessment of children with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure and non-exposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions. The results of the proposed research will fulfill our research goals, improve recruitment, and most importantly accurately identify individuals affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, leading to improved clinical diagnosis and intervention. Project Narrative This project is directly relevant to public health concerns related to the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and improved identification of alcohol-affected individuals with novel electronic data collection techniques. Improved identification methods and delineation of features related to alcohol-exposure will ultimately lead to improved treatment and help alleviate the public health burden associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.",A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,9878520,U01AA014834,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'California', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neuropsychology', 'Online Systems', 'Outpatients', 'Persons', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Administration', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Ukraine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Youth', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'classification trees', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'effective intervention', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'first grade', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'mobile application', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'novel', 'population based', 'recruit', 'response', 'tool', 'web portal']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,52675,35319116,0.30541214109542386
"Transcriptome-guided diagnosis and therapy for alcohol use disorder 1 Project Summary/Abstract  2 Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a chronic, relapsing condition and a major public health problem with few  3 pharmaceutical treatments available. Systems-based computational strategies that integrate brain gene  4 expression signatures of rodent models of AUD risk with gene expression signatures of pharmaceuticals show  5 promise for identifying compounds that decrease excessive drinking in rodents. However, this methodology  6 has limited clinical potential because it is not possible to obtain brain specimens from patients. Identifying a  7 clinically accessible tissue would facilitate the application of advanced computational approaches to identify  8 better therapeutics for AUD and personalize AUD treatment. To this end, the proposed research aims to  9 determine whether blood can be used as a surrogate tissue for brain by using a within-subjects design to 10 compare transcript levels in both tissues in mice during protracted withdrawal, a sensitive time for relapse to 11 excessive alcohol drinking. The research will also determine whether whole blood transcriptome profiles can be 12 used to classify subjects according to alcohol dependence status and to computationally predict compounds 13 that reduce alcohol consumption and anxiety- and depression-like behavior. The clinical and mechanistic 14 insights that will emerge from the proposed research should be considered independently. The first could lead 15 to effective diagnostic tools or candidate treatments, whereas the second will provide insight into the 16 pathophysiology of AUD. It might be the case that the blood transcriptome at least partially reflects the changes 17 in brain, and that targeting these changes is therapeutic. Or it might be the case that targeting the blood 18 transcriptome is therapeutic, irrespective of brain changes. The proposed study will provide crucial new 19 knowledge about a relatively new and unexplored area of addiction research that could drive molecular-based 20 diagnostic or therapeutic tools and personalized medicine approaches for AUD or other diseases where brain is 21 the primary affected tissue. Project Narrative Recent evidence in mice suggests that brain gene expression profiles can predict drugs effective for treating alcoholism, but it is not possible to obtain brain specimens from human patients which limits the usefulness of this approach. This research will investigate the extent to which blood can act as a surrogate for brain tissue and predict alcohol dependence status and drug treatments. This information will help to develop molecular- based diagnosis and treatment options for alcoholics and gain insights into the biological mechanisms that might contribute to the transition from recreational alcohol use to excessive drinking.",Transcriptome-guided diagnosis and therapy for alcohol use disorder,9906637,F32AA028148,"['Acids', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol withdrawal syndrome', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Ethanol', 'Expression Profiling', 'Female', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Healthcare', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Libraries', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Marble', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pergolide', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Schizophrenia', 'Specimen', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'System', 'Tail Suspension', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Whole Blood', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol availability', 'alcohol use disorder', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brain tissue', 'clinical development', 'design', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'drug candidate', 'forced swim test', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'negative affect', 'novel marker', 'personalized medicine', 'problem drinker', 'random forest', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vapor']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",F32,2019,61226,91740242,0.0993666157509337
"Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure Abstract As a constitutent component of CIFASD4, this project will focus on earlier detection of the neurofacial effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four topics of the Request for Application (RFA) will be targeted: a) improved FAS/FASD facial recognition through 3D photography and computer analyses in individuals of different age groups; b) the utility of prenatal ultrasound as a screening or diagnostic modality; c) 3D facial imaging during the neonatal period to detect more subtle facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure; d) innovative uses of technologies, including handheld devices with apps, to screen for dysmorphology. Previously, we have implemented methods and associated software for analyzing postnatal face shape for the detection of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Although effective in their accuracy, they rely on the use of expensive and relatively clumsy 3D cameras for which not insignificant training is required. New methods of 2D image analysis are available, mobile device acquisition of 3D images is imminent and online recruitment to clinical research is becoming more common place. Finally, state-of-the-art machine learning methods are proving effective in large-scale analysis of ultrasound and MRI data. To accomplish our goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Automated screening of facial images for effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with potential for on-line and  mobile device use and integration of genetic, behavioral and cognitive data; 2. Fetal ultrasound analysis to detect facial, cranial and neural effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with  neonatal follow-up; 3. Algorithm and software development to improve current analysis of face-brain-alcohol interactions. Achieving aim 1 will dramatically impact access to validated facial screening for prenatal alcohol exposure. Successful demonstration of aim 2 will achieve the earliest possible diagnosis enabling further research on interventions but also anticipatory neonatal management. Progress in aim 3 will enhance face-brain morphometric analyses in collaboration with other CIFASD partners (U01:Parnell/Eberhart, U01:Wozniak). We will work collaboratively with consortium partners who will recruit subjects and provide facial and ultrasound images (U01: Chambers; U01: Coles; U01: Mattson; U01: Weinberg; U01: Wozniak). We will co- operate on the analysis of images arising from basic science partners focusing on the use of animal models. We will rely on research resources for validation of postnatal screening tools (R24 Dysmorphology - Jones) and online/app development and data management (R24 Informatics - Barnett). Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop new methods for screening for the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. It will exploit the wide availability and convenience of smartphone and tablet devices to detect the facial effects in children and adults and new ways of analyzing ultrasound images to detect facial and brain effects in the fetus.

"Applying Machine Learning in the Prediction and Identification of Children Affected by Prenatal Alcohol Exposure Project summary Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which are caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, occur in up to 5% of the population in the United States, and are associated with lifelong disability. There are multiple difficulties in obtaining an accurate diagnosis of FASD, including subtlety of physical features and heterogeneity in presentation. Consequently, FASD is grossly under-recognized, and the majority of affected children never receive a diagnosis. If FASD could be diagnosed earlier and with more reliability, many years of beneficial intervention would not be lost. The objective of this research is to apply machine learning to high-dimensional data in well-characterized data sets to predict or characterize children with FASD. The central hypothesis of this research is that the application of machine learning will accurately predict and recognize FASD compared with expert clinical diagnosis. To test this hypothesis, machine learning will be employed to: 1) characterize FASD based on the presence of non-cardinal malformations, 2) establish multivariate predictors of FASD in preschool aged children, and 3) identify diagnosis specific neurodevelopmental markers that distinguish alcohol related neurodevelopmental deficits from neurodevelopmental deficits without prenatal exposure. Two secondary data sources will be used in this proposal; a prospective study of 400 pregnant women and their offspring in Ukraine (half of whom consumed high amounts of alcohol) with full clinical evaluations for FASD, and a cross- sectional study of over 2,900 first grade children in four regions of the U.S., all with clinical FASD evaluations. Upon successful completion of the proposed research, the expected contribution is for more accurate prediction and recognition of children with FASD. The proposed research is innovative, as it represents a departure from current practice by incorporating machine learning techniques into predictive models of FASD. As a perinatal epidemiologist, I have a strong foundation in analytic techniques, and the advanced training in machine learning will further enhance these skills. Additionally, the disease-focused training in dysmorphology and neurodevelopment will provide a strong foundation to make significant contributions to the field of FASD research. Finally, training and mentoring in grant writing and the responsible conduct of research will provide a strong foundation to transition to an independent researcher. This proposed research builds on previous NIAAA funded research by my interdisciplinary mentoring team, who are all strongly supportive of this research and training plan. This seminal application of machine learning to FASD research will demonstrate its capacity to predict and identify affected children, ultimately leading to earlier intervention of children prenatally exposed to alcohol. Narrative Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are common and result in lifelong disabilities; however, they are clini- cally difficult to identify, and the vast majority of children with FASD are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. The proposed research will leverage recent advances in machine learning to better identify children with FASD. These advances would lead to earlier identification and intervention in the lives of children prenatally exposed to alcohol, which can improve their developmental outcomes.",Applying Machine Learning in the Prediction and Identification of Children Affected by Prenatal Alcohol Exposure,9805491,K01AA027811,"['Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'Nursery Schools', 'Nutritional', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Ukraine', 'United States', 'Writing', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aged', 'alcohol exposure', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'disability', 'fetal diagnosis', 'first grade', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malformation', 'multidimensional data', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel strategies', 'offspring', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'research clinical testing', 'responsible research conduct', 'skills', 'sociodemographics', 'success']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K01,2019,164791,524978793,0.22420348643819302
"Developing a mobile alcohol biosensor platform for use in medication testing research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This mentored patient-oriented research career development award (K23) will enable Dr. Roberts to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinical researcher working to develop pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorder (AUD). This proposal outlines a 5-year training plan that supports a research program focused on developing a mobile biosensor platform for tracking medication effects on alcohol reactivity in ambulating outpatients. Training domains include 1) mobile biosensor assessment of alcohol use, 2) management and analysis of biosensor data, and 3) AUD pharmacotherapy development research. The training plan includes a strategic combination of mentor-led trainings; coursework in mobile health sensing, data science, statistics, bioethics, clinical research methods, and grant writing; attendance at relevant conferences and workshops; and collaboration with investigators conducting research in AUD pharmacotherapy development. The candidate will complete these training activities while completing a research program aimed at developing a mobile biosensor platform that can passively track alcohol consumption and deliver conditional assessments at key points during drinking episodes. In these preliminary studies, heavy drinkers with AUD will wear the mobile biosensors and receive alcohol in the laboratory. In Experiment 1, participants will receive two fixed doses of alcohol while wearing the biosensors and responding to prompted assessments. Goals of this experiment will be to 1) refine the machine-learning derived detection algorithms that will identify key points during drinking episodes and 2) evaluate the user experience and feasibility of delivering prompted assessments on a smartphone during drinking episodes. Experiment 2 will test the detection algorithms in a separate sample of freely behaving participants engaged in self-paced alcohol drinking. Results of these studies will serve as pilot data to support an R-mechanism application to develop a formal paradigm using the biosensor platform to track medication effects of alcohol use and reactivity in ambulating outpatients. Dr. Roberts has assembled an mentorship committee of leaders in the field. Dr. McKee (primary mentor) is a Professor of Psychiatry at the Yale University. She applies innovative laboratory paradigms to AUD pharmacotherapy development research, and she has several lines of research using mobile health biosensors to track substance use behavior. Dr. Ramchandani (primary co-mentor) is a clinical investigator and Chief of the Human Psychopharmacology Section at the NIAAA intramural research program. He will lead Dr. Roberts's training in alcohol pharmacokinetics. Drs. Gueorguieva, Petrakis, and Gerstein will serve as secondary mentors and contribute to Dr. Roberts's training in longitudinal data analysis, AUD pharmacotherapy clinical trials, and machine learning and data science, respectively. Drs. Miranda and Barnett will serve as external advisers and support Dr. Roberts's training in ambulatory assessment in the context of medication development research and transdermal alcohol detection, respectively. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcohol use disorder is a potentially disabling disease with a large economic and health burden in the United States. This proposal furthers public health interests by providing important training opportunities to an early- career clinical investigator interested in developing medication to treat alcohol use disorder.

"Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure Abstract As a constitutent component of CIFASD4, this project will focus on earlier detection of the neurofacial effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four topics of the Request for Application (RFA) will be targeted: a) improved FAS/FASD facial recognition through 3D photography and computer analyses in individuals of different age groups; b) the utility of prenatal ultrasound as a screening or diagnostic modality; c) 3D facial imaging during the neonatal period to detect more subtle facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure; d) innovative uses of technologies, including handheld devices with apps, to screen for dysmorphology. Previously, we have implemented methods and associated software for analyzing postnatal face shape for the detection of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Although effective in their accuracy, they rely on the use of expensive and relatively clumsy 3D cameras for which not insignificant training is required. New methods of 2D image analysis are available, mobile device acquisition of 3D images is imminent and online recruitment to clinical research is becoming more common place. Finally, state-of-the-art machine learning methods are proving effective in large-scale analysis of ultrasound and MRI data. To accomplish our goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Automated screening of facial images for effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with potential for on-line and  mobile device use and integration of genetic, behavioral and cognitive data; 2. Fetal ultrasound analysis to detect facial, cranial and neural effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with  neonatal follow-up; 3. Algorithm and software development to improve current analysis of face-brain-alcohol interactions. Achieving aim 1 will dramatically impact access to validated facial screening for prenatal alcohol exposure. Successful demonstration of aim 2 will achieve the earliest possible diagnosis enabling further research on interventions but also anticipatory neonatal management. Progress in aim 3 will enhance face-brain morphometric analyses in collaboration with other CIFASD partners (U01:Parnell/Eberhart, U01:Wozniak).

"3/3 Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV – Intervention Research Arm (ARCH-IRA) Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs) and hazardous drinking are the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the US and are responsible for 10% of all deaths among working age adults. Among Persons Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH), heavy alcohol use is up to twice the rate in the general population. Few people engage in behavioral alcohol treatment and alcohol pharmacotherapies are not routinely used as part of alcohol treatment, despite the known efficacy of these interventions. PLWH engaged in treatment for their HIV disease have regular contact with a medical provider and are treated in a medical home model in which all medical services are delivered within HIV clinics, but few HIV providers feel comfortable treating AUDs. During our initial funding period, we implemented routine alcohol screening, developed a computerized brief intervention (CBI), and conducted provider training on alcohol pharmacotherapies. However, while we found a strong impact from routine screening with CBI for reducing alcohol use, few providers prescribed alcohol pharmacotherapy, despite this specialized training, with most indicating continued discomfort and lack of knowledge for use of pharmacotherapy. Algorithms are used routinely to guide providers in treatment selection for many different disorders that are not within their specialty such as diabetes management, obesity, arthritis, and other disorders. In addition, we tested the use of provider algorithms for the treatment of depression and smoking with PLWH and demonstrated increased utilization of these medications. For this renewal, we are proposing an implementation science test of using an algorithm that will build upon our success with CBI and integrate alcohol pharmacotherapies and other behavioral therapies within routine treatment. A decision-tree algorithm that provides more intensive treatments, including alcohol pharmacotherapies, that is also responsive to comorbidities such as depressive or anxiety symptoms will be tested in three HIV clinics across CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS). Primary outcomes include reduced alcohol consumption and frequency, improved HIV outcomes, and improvement in comorbid conditions. We will also examine provider, staff, patient, and clinic-level facilitators and barriers to implementation of this algorithm in routine clinical care. Successful implementation of this treatment approach would have considerable impact on reducing AUDs among PLWH and could be integrated within existing electronic health record systems for a sustainable model of alcohol treatment delivery to other HIV clinics. Hazardous alcohol use is the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the United States and is up to twice as high among PLWH. Algorithms have been developed to increase the efficacy of the treatment of chronic diseases with tremendous success but have never been empirically tested to aid in alcohol use disorders (AUDs). We propose to test an algorithm developed to aid providers in selecting behavioral and pharmacotherapy for the treatment of AUDs for PLWH engaged in care.",3/3 Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV – Intervention Research Arm (ARCH-IRA),9768294,U01AA020802,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Achievement', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Arthritis', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Trees', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Geography', 'HIV', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Home environment', 'Hypertension', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Maintenance', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol screening', 'alcohol services', 'alcohol use disorder', 'anxiety symptoms', 'arm', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brief alcohol intervention', 'brief intervention', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'computerized', 'consumption measures', 'depressive symptoms', 'diabetes management', 'drinking', 'evidence base', 'hazardous drinking', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'preventable death', 'primary outcome', 'reduced alcohol use', 'routine screening', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'transmission process', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,U01,2019,340037,325573502,0.09430229952726572
"Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria Project Summary: FASD is a serious public health crisis with 80,000 to 120,000 U.S. pregnancies per year at high risk. FASD diagnostic clinics are very sparse, difficult to sustain because of diagnostic complexity, unable to meet demand, and plagued by disagreement about diagnostic criteria. A recent comparison of five FASD diagnostic systems acknowledged that the lack of objective biomarkers for prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) contributes to disagreement in the field. The goal of the proposed work is to develop and refine neuroimaging methods capable of identifying subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE. A critical component of this project will be to apply these refined neuroimaging “biomarkers” to examine the validity and performance of the most commonly-used FASD diagnostic criteria (alcohol exposure, dysmorphology, growth, and cognition). The proposed project will push the development of imaging methods and will also include an examination of the sensitivity and specificity of current diagnostic factors. The aims are: 1) perform a comprehensive characterization of the FASD “connectome” using state-of- the-art Human Connectome Project (HCP) methods in children with PAE, 2) evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of FASD diagnostic criteria to provide objective evaluation of FASD criteria (which remain in flux), 3) characterize relationships between connectomics and cognitive functioning, & 4) examine the developmental course of functional connectivity, white matter connectivity, cortical gyrification, and intra-cortical myelin. Participants will undergo longitudinal re-assessment at 15-months to match the new HCP-development paradigm (HCP-D) to allow for comparison to a large normative dataset being collected in Minnesota as part of the HCP-D project. We will capitalize on the developments spawned from the $40 million HCP and will benefit from evaluating the brains of children with PAE against the backdrop of a very large HCP normative dataset (n=1300). The proposed study will examine 45 participants with PAE and 45 matched controls, ages 8-16, all of whom will be evaluated by the CIFASD dysmorphology project. Participants will undergo MRI scans at the University of Minnesota's Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) at baseline and again 15 months later. The imaging protocol, which contains very high resolution structural, diffusion- weighted, and fMRI scans will evaluate cortical gyrification, intra-cortical myelin, white matter connectivity, and functional connectivity. Data from the HCP-D project will be used as secondary “normative” comparison dataset. We expect to find a number of subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE that have not previously been observed and we will characterize individuals with these metrics. Individual identification of neurodevelopmental anomalies will then allow us to probe the screening properties of commonly used FASD diagnostic criteria and to test the performance of Dr. Mattson's Decision Tree model for rapidly identifying children with developmental effects of PAE. The study will have direct implications for FASD clinical practice and public policies as it will provide objective data about the relative advantages and disadvantages of individual diagnostic elements and it will allow for comparisons of competing FASD diagnostic systems. The proposed project aims to use the most advanced MRI brain imaging techniques available to address a highly practical problem faced by clinicians and public health officials: the lack of consensus about diagnostic criteria for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and the challenges of identifying individuals who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) but do not have the physical characteristics upon which a diagnosis can be made. The proposed study will identify subtle brain anomalies in children with PAE with a level of sensitivity not previously attainable. The study will push forward our understanding of how PAE negatively affects the efficiency of the brain's networks. In addition, the study will use these brain imaging results to further refine the diagnostic criteria such that more children will be able to be properly identified as having a neurodevelopmental disorder as a result of PAE.",Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria,9698862,U01AA026102,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Factor', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dysmorphology', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Myelin', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'connectome', 'diffusion weighted', 'executive function', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'negative affect', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'performance tests', 'prisma', 'processing speed', 'screening', 'white matter']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,U01,2019,347168,340417756,0.18941862784923486
"Administrative Core of the CIFASD Project Summary/Abstract The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is a multidisciplinary, international consortium of research projects and resource cores charged with improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD. The Administrative Resource Core of the CIFASD (AdminC) has led this consortium since it was first established in 2003 and plays a critical leadership role in the coordination of research efforts and ensuring progress toward consortium goals. CIFASD addresses issues related to prenatal alcohol exposure across the lifespan, using a range of interrelated clinical and preclinical research approaches. This iteration of the consortium consists of multiple collaborative components including four resource U24 cores (AdminC, Dysmorphology, Informatics, and Outreach/Dissemination), nine U01 research projects (clinical, basic science, and/or translational) and two exploratory/developmental UH2 projects. One goal of the CIFASD is to improve identification of individuals who have been affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. This will be accomplished by assessing biomarkers, such as immune and miRNA profiles, and by using neuroimaging techniques that may be more sensitive to subtle pathology seen in individuals who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for FAS. In addition, CIFASD will develop novel tools, such as 3D facial and neurobehavioral screening, which can be assessed remotely and made more universally accessible through eHealth. The use of telemedicine will also provide access to more detailed dysmorphology evaluations. Another goal is to identify risk and resiliency factors, including genetic influences that will help with understanding the mechanisms of alcohol's damaging effects and also lead to more targeted interventions. A third goal is to better understand the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on consequences across the lifespan, including adulthood. Finally, an intervention for improving outcomes will be modified to a mobile platform, so that it can reach larger populations of individuals with FASD and their families. Collectively, these projects have the potential for moving the FASD field forward, improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD and serving a wide audience with the technologies available in eHealth. The Specific Aims of the AdminC are to: 1) Provide scientific and administrative direction, leadership and oversight to CIFASD; 2) Facilitate communication among the various projects and the dissemination of results; 3) Assist with data management strategies; 4) Provide annual evaluations of progress; and 5) Provide assistance to projects with implementing eHealth technology. The AdminC provides the foundation for the interactive and supportive framework of CIFASD by establishing regular communications with all members through monthly conference calls and biannual meetings; leading the Steering Committee in the establishment and implementation of CIFASD priorities and policies; supporting the Science Advisory Board with its evaluations of progress on each component as well as the overall mission of CIFASD; as well as serving as the liaison between the consortium's project scientists and its NIAAA advisors. Project Narrative The consequences resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure are wide-ranging and a major and costly public health problem.

"Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children Maternal substance use disorders are a substantial public health concern and the neurological consequences of prenatal exposure are a major threat to the long-term health of offspring. Globally, prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is between 2-7 and 20-50 per 1000, respectively. By contrast, in certain high-risk communities in South Africa, prevalence is reported to be as high as 63 and 155 per 1000, respectively. Though prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is known to affect the central nervous system, to date, little data exists in respect of the impact of PAE in early childhood, before both higher-level brain networks are established and other potentially confounding post- natal environmental influences have come into play. For neurodevelopmental disorders, studies have consistently shown that early intervention, based on detection and targeted interventions, leads to better long-term outcomes. We aim to address this precise gap in knowledge by imaging the brain and 3D face across the FASD continuum to investigate early biomarkers, trajectories and functional correlates of PAE in a cohort followed prospectively from birth to age 6 years. Data: Our cohort includes a well characterized subsample of children (PAE and healthy controls) enrolled in the Drakenstein Child Health Study in Cape Town, South Africa, who have been scanned as neonates and at 2-3 years of age. Preliminary published data shows highly significant relationships between PAE and regional gray and white matter changes, already discernible in newborns, well before the age FASD is typically diagnosed. An additional longitudinal assessment at 6-years will yield a unique FASD sample with 3 distinct time points (infants, toddlers and children), allowing characterization of brain and face morphology and brain structure and function in this previously understudied early developmental period. This proposal addresses fundamental gaps concerning the presence, timing and regional specificity of altered brain morphology and structural and functional connectivity in association with the effects of PAE on the developing brain from birth to 6 years, and the relationships with facial dysmorphology. The research team has successfully gathered data from the proposed cohort as neonates and at 2–3 years of age. The benefits of extending this research to a subsequent imaging time-point, with a larger range of developmental and neurobehavioral assessments, provides an unprecedented opportunity to determine longitudinal effects of PAE on the trajectory of the developing brain in these critical early years, the links between neural and face predictors of PAE and the long-term clinical significance of these findings. This research will illuminate early neurodevelopmental mechanisms leading to subsequent behavioral and neurological disturbances, which may allow opportunities for targeting interventions when brain plasticity is still relatively fluid. This project might also lead to new strategies for early diagnosis using both face and brain biomarkers. Project Narrative Fetal exposure of the brain to alcohol can trigger brain abnormalities that unfold over a lifetime with severe consequences both for the affected individual and for society at large. To date, these brain abnormalities and associated deficits and behaviors have mostly been studied in late childhood or later, with very few studies following the consequences of well documented fetal alcohol exposure as they develop in the same individual across time in early childhood when the brain is most responsive to potential treatments. This project will extend an ongoing study of children with fetal alcohol exposure, already characterized as newborns and at age 2-3 to add assessments of the brain and behavior at age 6 and will explore alcohol-induced facial abnormalities as a complementary predictor of brain problems. !",Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children,9788191,R01AA026834,"['2 year old', '3 year old', '3-Dimensional', '6 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Neonatal', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'alcohol exposure', 'antenatal', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'efficacy testing', 'fetal diagnosis', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal alcohol use', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'maternal depression', 'multimodality', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal exposure', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'shape analysis', 'statistics', 'white matter', 'white matter change']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,498954,673201228,0.1789814272503458
"A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Project Summary This request for a renewal of funding is in response to the NIH/NIAAA funding opportunity entitled, “Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)” (RFA-AA-17-007). The overarching aim of the current proposal is to develop, validate, and implement clinically novel and innovative measurement tools to accurately identify children who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. The proposed study is relevant to the overall objective of the CIFASD funding opportunity “to accelerate specific areas of research related to the translation of new or improved capabilities in FASD clinical case recognition.” This is critical need. While there has been a concerted research effort since the initial clinical delineation of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), understanding the full spectrum of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure remains incomplete, hindering effective intervention. Although individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure may experience significantly impairing functional difficulties, identification of these individuals is inadequate. High rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis result in lost opportunities for intervention and misunderstanding of the etiology of observed difficulties. Development of accurate and specific identification tools will improve diagnostic capability and clinical decision-making regarding treatment. To this end, during previous funding periods we substantially enhanced the understanding of the specificity of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure to increase identification of alcohol-affected youth. Our hierarchical CIFASD Decision Tree, developed and validated on over 800 subjects, indicates that administration of just 4 measures can distinguish alcohol-affected youth from nonexposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions with accuracy rates of >80%. While a significant step forward, the Decision Tree was developed and validated in a research sample with a high risk of alcohol effects. One aim of the current proposal is to develop and test an electronic version of the Decision Tree (the eTree) in lower risk, international, population-based, and clinic-based samples. Another aim of the proposal, in line with the specific RFA goal to use innovative technologies to screen for dysmorphology and/or neurobehavioral deficits to aid in the identification of alcohol-exposed individuals, is the development and implementation of the FASD Online Neurobehavioral Screen (FONS), a web-based neurobehavioral assessment tool for use with subjects recruited via a web portal (cf. Foroud U01). The FONS will measure domains known to be affected in FASD, including those represented in diagnostic criteria for neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE). The eTree and the FONS will be validated using laboratory-based in-person neuropsychological assessment of children with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure and non-exposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions. The results of the proposed research will fulfill our research goals, improve recruitment, and most importantly accurately identify individuals affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, leading to improved clinical diagnosis and intervention. Project Narrative This project is directly relevant to public health concerns related to the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and improved identification of alcohol-affected individuals with novel electronic data collection techniques. Improved identification methods and delineation of features related to alcohol-exposure will ultimately lead to improved treatment and help alleviate the public health burden associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.",A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,9698844,U01AA014834,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'California', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neuropsychology', 'Online Systems', 'Outpatients', 'Persons', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Administration', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Ukraine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Youth', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'classification trees', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'effective intervention', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'first grade', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'mobile application', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'novel', 'population based', 'recruit', 'response', 'tool', 'web portal']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,529039,35319116,0.30541214109542386
"Identification of fetal alcohol-affected children: Alterations in imprinted gene expression and methylation as biomarkers of neurobehavioral and growth impairment. Abstract Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the most common preventable cause of neurodevelopmental disabilities, with prevalence estimates of 3-10/1000 individuals in the US and up to 80/1000 in endemic communities. The promise of an increasing number of interventions tailored to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE)-related neurobehavioral deficits is limited by diagnostic difficulties in clinical practice. Currently known biomarkers of exposure are neither sensitive nor specific for neurobehavioral deficits, in part because not all exposed children are affected. There is, therefore, a critical need for biomarkers of effect to identify affected children who would benefit from early, tailored therapeutic interventions. A growing body of literature has demonstrated alcohol-induced alterations in epigenetic programming as an important potential mechanism in FASD, suggesting that such alterations may serve as biomarkers of effect. Imprinted genes comprise a unique subset of epigenetically regulated genes that is sensitive to prenatal insults. There is considerable overlap between the neurobehavioral domains affected by FASD and those seen in experimental animal models of imprinted gene dysregulation, including learning, memory, and attachment. In a prenatally- recruited, prospective longitudinal cohort, we recently found that PAE was associated with alterations in placental level of expression of 11 of 93 expressed imprinted genes. Expression changes for five of these genes statistically mediated effects of alcohol on postnatal growth, identifying these alterations as biomarkers of fetal alcohol growth restriction. Given the remarkable overlap between the neurobehavioral domains affected in FASD and those affected by alteration of imprinted gene expression in animal models, alcohol-induced alterations in placental imprinted gene expression may also provide biomarkers for FASD neurocognitive deficits. Although most epigenetic marks are specific to tissue-type and timing of exposure, genomic imprinting maps and our pilot data indicate that markers of imprinted gene dysregulation identified in placental tissue may be detected in blood samples obtained at older ages. The aims of this study are: (1) To characterize the fetal alcohol-related imprintome signature in the placenta and in blood samples obtained at 6 yr; (2) To identify alterations in imprinted gene level of expression and ICR methylation that can serve as biomarkers of effect; (3) To validate findings in Aims 1 and 2 in blood samples from a 2nd, independent cohort. The data for this study will come from two prospective longitudinal cohorts recruited from the Cape Coloured community in Cape Town, South Africa, where the prevalence of FASD is among the highest in the world. Results from this study will make it possible to identify affected children who would benefit from early therapeutic interventions but would likely not be detected by current diagnostic tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite widespread public health advisories, alcohol use during pregnancy persists in the U.S. and worldwide, making fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) the most common preventable cause of neurodevelopmental delay. The promise of an ever-increasing number of interventions tailored to FASD deficits is limited by difficulties in identifying fetal alcohol-related facial dysmorphology in infancy and early childhood, when interventions are most effective, and in children with alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, in which neurodevelopmental impairment occurs in the absence of dysmorphic features. This proposal seeks to identify alterations in imprinted gene expression that can be used as biomarkers of adverse effect to identify infants and children with FASD who would benefit from therapeutic interventions but would probably not be detected by current diagnostic tools.",Identification of fetal alcohol-affected children: Alterations in imprinted gene expression and methylation as biomarkers of neurobehavioral and growth impairment.,9913250,R01AA027916,"['Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Growth', 'Growth Disorders', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methylation', 'Microcephaly', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Nursery Schools', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Placenta', 'Play', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'South Africa', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'alcohol effect', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'early childhood', 'fetal', 'fetal diagnosis', 'gene function', 'imprint', 'infancy', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'whole genome']",NIAAA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,597565,558628098,0.22434218814191523
"A Saliva Based Kit for the Epigenetic Assessment of Heavy Alcohol Intake Heavy alcohol use is common, yet avoidable cause of death, disability and human suffering. These adverse outcomes are potentially avoidable if heavy alcohol use is spotted early. However, current screening methods for chronic alcohol consumption capture alcohol usage only in the hours prior to testing or rely on insensitive, non-specific protein assays. In a recent highly successful Phase II project, using DNA from whole blood, we demonstrated that a combination of just two methylation sensitive droplet digital PCR (MSddPCR) assays could quite accurately identify subjects with recent heavy alcohol consumption. Since then, we have continued to advance those findings and have developed additional, even more powerful MSddPCR assays and refined our processes to only require the DNA found in a single drop of blood. In conjunction with our ethics and marketing team, we are now in the process of rolling this product nationwide.  However, a significant barrier to a more universal implementation of this disruptive technology is the requirement for blood. Conceivably, a test that could use the DNA from saliva could circumvent patient concerns about the discomfort of a needle or lancet stick. In addition, it would enable both non-medically oriented alcohol treatment programs and telemedicine oriented treatment programs to more easily assess client response to treatment. This will be particularly critical for treatment of alcoholism in the elderly, who are often unable or unwilling to travel to alcohol treatment facilities.  In this Phase I proposal, we intend to take the next steps to the creation of a saliva DNA screening test for heavy alcohol consumption. Already, we have collected and prepared saliva DNA on 150 subjects recently admitted to alcohol treatment and 150 age, gender and ethnicity matched controls. In addition, we have also developed an MSddPCR assay that can adjust for cellular heterogeneity in the saliva DNA.  In this application, we will use these resources to whether MSddPCR assessments of saliva DNA can also be used to detect heavy alcohol consumption. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will determine methylation status at 4 CpG loci with high predictive power for detecting alcohol consumption and one locus whose information content can be used to correct for cellular admixture in saliva. Then, in Aim 2, we will conduct a series of quality assessment of the saliva DNA. Finally, in Aim 3, we will analyze the data from our 4 highly predictive loci, correcting when necessary for cellular admixture, to determine an algorithm capable of predicting heavy alcohol use status. In addition, we will analyze the quality control measures to identify those saliva DNA samples which give unreliable. As a result of this project, we will produce a set of MSddPCR assays and a quality control metric for a rigorous multisite Phase II test of this “bloodless” NextGen product. Narrative Current diagnostic approaches for the assessment of heavy alcohol use normally use blood. However, many patients do not like to have their blood drawn or are cared for in a healthcare setting in which blood cannot be obtained. In this project, we will adapt our recently discovered DNA methylation based techniques to see if they can use saliva DNA instead of whole blood DNA.",A Saliva Based Kit for the Epigenetic Assessment of Heavy Alcohol Intake,9680049,R43AA027423,"['Abstinence', 'Admixture', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'CLIA certified', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Client', 'Consumption', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drops', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Gender', 'Gene Dosage', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Hand', 'Health Personnel', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intellectual Property', 'International', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Needles', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'RNase P', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Resources', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Security', 'Series', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Transportation', 'Travel', 'Whole Blood', 'adverse outcome', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol monitoring', 'alcohol use disorder', 'alcoholism therapy', 'base', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'digital', 'disability', 'health care settings', 'human DNA', 'improved', 'interest', 'next generation', 'phase 2 testing', 'product development', 'screening', 'social', 'technology validation', 'treatment program', 'treatment response']",NIAAA,"BEHAVIORAL DIAGNOSTICS, INC.",R43,2018,223260,0,0.1502244101648655
"1-D Titania Nanostructure Based Wearable Alcohol Sensor with Tunable Sensitivity and Artificial Intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop an artificially intelligent alcohol sensor that is wearable, non- invasive, smart, and aesthetic. The aim, in Phase I, is to design and develop the alcohol sensor based on metal (i.e., Cobalt) functionalized Titanium nanotubes (TiNT) to detect, monitor, and display blood alcohol levels in real-time using microcontrollers-based wrist-band like devices. At the core of our innovation, we have Cobalt- functionalized TiNT sensors which are capable of detecting alcohol exposure from the skin in 1ppm level that can be tuned down to 1ppb level as well (i.e., sensitivity of the sensor is tunable). The control unit of our system is reusable, sensors are replaceable, the microcontrollers are equipped with a micro-SD card for personal-data storage, and the proposed unit has a built-in wireless system for data transmission. This proposal also aims, in Phase II, to create an integrated artificially intelligent (AI) network that will have the capabilities of (a) translating the real-time data into a pre-cautious safety signals that will communicate with the personal vehicle safety features through a wireless signal (i.e., Bluetooth), and (c) adaptively taking unattended decisions-on-demand (DoD) through machine learning when the driver is heavily intoxicated. 1 Project Narrative Breath-analyzers within the law enforcement settings alone cannot tackle the problems associated with alcohol consumptions and abuse. Recently developed wearable alcohol sensor technologies mostly rely on wet-electrochemical environments around the skin. Therefore, we propose to develop wearable alcohol sensor using titania nanotube which will be dry, non- invasive, artificially intelligent, and aesthetic.

"Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure Abstract As a constitutent component of CIFASD4, this project will focus on earlier detection of the neurofacial effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four topics of the Request for Application (RFA) will be targeted: a) improved FAS/FASD facial recognition through 3D photography and computer analyses in individuals of different age groups; b) the utility of prenatal ultrasound as a screening or diagnostic modality; c) 3D facial imaging during the neonatal period to detect more subtle facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure; d) innovative uses of technologies, including handheld devices with apps, to screen for dysmorphology. Previously, we have implemented methods and associated software for analyzing postnatal face shape for the detection of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Although effective in their accuracy, they rely on the use of expensive and relatively clumsy 3D cameras for which not insignificant training is required. New methods of 2D image analysis are available, mobile device acquisition of 3D images is imminent and online recruitment to clinical research is becoming more common place. Finally, state-of-the-art machine learning methods are proving effective in large-scale analysis of ultrasound and MRI data. To accomplish our goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Automated screening of facial images for effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with potential for on-line and  mobile device use and integration of genetic, behavioral and cognitive data; 2. Fetal ultrasound analysis to detect facial, cranial and neural effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with  neonatal follow-up; 3. Algorithm and software development to improve current analysis of face-brain-alcohol interactions. Achieving aim 1 will dramatically impact access to validated facial screening for prenatal alcohol exposure. Successful demonstration of aim 2 will achieve the earliest possible diagnosis enabling further research on interventions but also anticipatory neonatal management. Progress in aim 3 will enhance face-brain morphometric analyses in collaboration with other CIFASD partners (U01:Parnell/Eberhart, U01:Wozniak). We will work collaboratively with consortium partners who will recruit subjects and provide facial and ultrasound images (U01: Chambers; U01: Coles; U01: Mattson; U01: Weinberg; U01: Wozniak). We will co- operate on the analysis of images arising from basic science partners focusing on the use of animal models. We will rely on research resources for validation of postnatal screening tools (R24 Dysmorphology - Jones) and online/app development and data management (R24 Informatics - Barnett).

"Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria Project Summary: FASD is a serious public health crisis with 80,000 to 120,000 U.S. pregnancies per year at high risk. FASD diagnostic clinics are very sparse, difficult to sustain because of diagnostic complexity, unable to meet demand, and plagued by disagreement about diagnostic criteria. A recent comparison of five FASD diagnostic systems acknowledged that the lack of objective biomarkers for prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) contributes to disagreement in the field. The goal of the proposed work is to develop and refine neuroimaging methods capable of identifying subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE. A critical component of this project will be to apply these refined neuroimaging “biomarkers” to examine the validity and performance of the most commonly-used FASD diagnostic criteria (alcohol exposure, dysmorphology, growth, and cognition). The proposed project will push the development of imaging methods and will also include an examination of the sensitivity and specificity of current diagnostic factors. The aims are: 1) perform a comprehensive characterization of the FASD “connectome” using state-of- the-art Human Connectome Project (HCP) methods in children with PAE, 2) evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of FASD diagnostic criteria to provide objective evaluation of FASD criteria (which remain in flux), 3) characterize relationships between connectomics and cognitive functioning, & 4) examine the developmental course of functional connectivity, white matter connectivity, cortical gyrification, and intra-cortical myelin. Participants will undergo longitudinal re-assessment at 15-months to match the new HCP-development paradigm (HCP-D) to allow for comparison to a large normative dataset being collected in Minnesota as part of the HCP-D project. We will capitalize on the developments spawned from the $40 million HCP and will benefit from evaluating the brains of children with PAE against the backdrop of a very large HCP normative dataset (n=1300). The proposed study will examine 45 participants with PAE and 45 matched controls, ages 8-16, all of whom will be evaluated by the CIFASD dysmorphology project. Participants will undergo MRI scans at the University of Minnesota's Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) at baseline and again 15 months later. The imaging protocol, which contains very high resolution structural, diffusion- weighted, and fMRI scans will evaluate cortical gyrification, intra-cortical myelin, white matter connectivity, and functional connectivity. Data from the HCP-D project will be used as secondary “normative” comparison dataset. We expect to find a number of subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE that have not previously been observed and we will characterize individuals with these metrics. Individual identification of neurodevelopmental anomalies will then allow us to probe the screening properties of commonly used FASD diagnostic criteria and to test the performance of Dr. Mattson's Decision Tree model for rapidly identifying children with developmental effects of PAE. The study will have direct implications for FASD clinical practice and public policies as it will provide objective data about the relative advantages and disadvantages of individual diagnostic elements and it will allow for comparisons of competing FASD diagnostic systems. The proposed project aims to use the most advanced MRI brain imaging techniques available to address a highly practical problem faced by clinicians and public health officials: the lack of consensus about diagnostic criteria for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and the challenges of identifying individuals who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) but do not have the physical characteristics upon which a diagnosis can be made. The proposed study will identify subtle brain anomalies in children with PAE with a level of sensitivity not previously attainable. The study will push forward our understanding of how PAE negatively affects the efficiency of the brain's networks. In addition, the study will use these brain imaging results to further refine the diagnostic criteria such that more children will be able to be properly identified as having a neurodevelopmental disorder as a result of PAE.",Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria,9524815,U01AA026102,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Factor', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dysmorphology', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Myelin', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structural defect', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'connectome', 'diffusion weighted', 'executive function', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidisciplinary', 'negative affect', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'performance tests', 'prisma', 'processing speed', 'screening', 'white matter']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,U01,2018,333476,340417756,0.18941862784923486
"A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Project Summary This request for a renewal of funding is in response to the NIH/NIAAA funding opportunity entitled, “Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)” (RFA-AA-17-007). The overarching aim of the current proposal is to develop, validate, and implement clinically novel and innovative measurement tools to accurately identify children who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. The proposed study is relevant to the overall objective of the CIFASD funding opportunity “to accelerate specific areas of research related to the translation of new or improved capabilities in FASD clinical case recognition.” This is critical need. While there has been a concerted research effort since the initial clinical delineation of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), understanding the full spectrum of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure remains incomplete, hindering effective intervention. Although individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure may experience significantly impairing functional difficulties, identification of these individuals is inadequate. High rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis result in lost opportunities for intervention and misunderstanding of the etiology of observed difficulties. Development of accurate and specific identification tools will improve diagnostic capability and clinical decision-making regarding treatment. To this end, during previous funding periods we substantially enhanced the understanding of the specificity of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure to increase identification of alcohol-affected youth. Our hierarchical CIFASD Decision Tree, developed and validated on over 800 subjects, indicates that administration of just 4 measures can distinguish alcohol-affected youth from nonexposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions with accuracy rates of >80%. While a significant step forward, the Decision Tree was developed and validated in a research sample with a high risk of alcohol effects. One aim of the current proposal is to develop and test an electronic version of the Decision Tree (the eTree) in lower risk, international, population-based, and clinic-based samples. Another aim of the proposal, in line with the specific RFA goal to use innovative technologies to screen for dysmorphology and/or neurobehavioral deficits to aid in the identification of alcohol-exposed individuals, is the development and implementation of the FASD Online Neurobehavioral Screen (FONS), a web-based neurobehavioral assessment tool for use with subjects recruited via a web portal (cf. Foroud U01). The FONS will measure domains known to be affected in FASD, including those represented in diagnostic criteria for neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE). The eTree and the FONS will be validated using laboratory-based in-person neuropsychological assessment of children with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure and non-exposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions. The results of the proposed research will fulfill our research goals, improve recruitment, and most importantly accurately identify individuals affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, leading to improved clinical diagnosis and intervention. Project Narrative This project is directly relevant to public health concerns related to the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and improved identification of alcohol-affected individuals with novel electronic data collection techniques. Improved identification methods and delineation of features related to alcohol-exposure will ultimately lead to improved treatment and help alleviate the public health burden associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.",A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,9524819,U01AA014834,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'California', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neuropsychology', 'Online Systems', 'Outpatients', 'Persons', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Self-Administered', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Ukraine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Youth', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'effective intervention', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'first grade', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'mobile application', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'novel', 'population based', 'recruit', 'response', 'tool', 'web portal']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,361787,35319116,0.30541214109542386
"3/3 Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV – Intervention Research Arm (ARCH-IRA) Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs) and hazardous drinking are the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the US and are responsible for 10% of all deaths among working age adults. Among Persons Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH), heavy alcohol use is up to twice the rate in the general population. Few people engage in behavioral alcohol treatment and alcohol pharmacotherapies are not routinely used as part of alcohol treatment, despite the known efficacy of these interventions. PLWH engaged in treatment for their HIV disease have regular contact with a medical provider and are treated in a medical home model in which all medical services are delivered within HIV clinics, but few HIV providers feel comfortable treating AUDs. During our initial funding period, we implemented routine alcohol screening, developed a computerized brief intervention (CBI), and conducted provider training on alcohol pharmacotherapies. However, while we found a strong impact from routine screening with CBI for reducing alcohol use, few providers prescribed alcohol pharmacotherapy, despite this specialized training, with most indicating continued discomfort and lack of knowledge for use of pharmacotherapy. Algorithms are used routinely to guide providers in treatment selection for many different disorders that are not within their specialty such as diabetes management, obesity, arthritis, and other disorders. In addition, we tested the use of provider algorithms for the treatment of depression and smoking with PLWH and demonstrated increased utilization of these medications. For this renewal, we are proposing an implementation science test of using an algorithm that will build upon our success with CBI and integrate alcohol pharmacotherapies and other behavioral therapies within routine treatment. A decision-tree algorithm that provides more intensive treatments, including alcohol pharmacotherapies, that is also responsive to comorbidities such as depressive or anxiety symptoms will be tested in three HIV clinics across CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS). Primary outcomes include reduced alcohol consumption and frequency, improved HIV outcomes, and improvement in comorbid conditions. We will also examine provider, staff, patient, and clinic-level facilitators and barriers to implementation of this algorithm in routine clinical care. Successful implementation of this treatment approach would have considerable impact on reducing AUDs among PLWH and could be integrated within existing electronic health record systems for a sustainable model of alcohol treatment delivery to other HIV clinics. Hazardous alcohol use is the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the United States and is up to twice as high among PLWH. Algorithms have been developed to increase the efficacy of the treatment of chronic diseases with tremendous success but have never been empirically tested to aid in alcohol use disorders (AUDs). We propose to test an algorithm developed to aid providers in selecting behavioral and pharmacotherapy for the treatment of AUDs for PLWH engaged in care.",3/3 Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV – Intervention Research Arm (ARCH-IRA),9564774,U01AA020802,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Achievement', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Arthritis', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Trees', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Geography', 'HIV', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Home environment', 'Hypertension', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Maintenance', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol screening', 'alcohol services', 'alcohol use disorder', 'anxiety symptoms', 'arm', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brief alcohol intervention', 'brief intervention', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'computerized', 'consumption measures', 'depressive symptoms', 'diabetes management', 'drinking', 'evidence base', 'hazardous drinking', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'preventable death', 'primary outcome', 'reduced alcohol use', 'routine screening', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'transmission process', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,U01,2018,369768,325573502,0.09430229952726572
"Administrative Core of the CIFASD Project Summary/Abstract The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is a multidisciplinary, international consortium of research projects and resource cores charged with improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD. The Administrative Resource Core of the CIFASD (AdminC) has led this consortium since it was first established in 2003 and plays a critical leadership role in the coordination of research efforts and ensuring progress toward consortium goals. CIFASD addresses issues related to prenatal alcohol exposure across the lifespan, using a range of interrelated clinical and preclinical research approaches. This iteration of the consortium consists of multiple collaborative components including four resource U24 cores (AdminC, Dysmorphology, Informatics, and Outreach/Dissemination), nine U01 research projects (clinical, basic science, and/or translational) and two exploratory/developmental UH2 projects. One goal of the CIFASD is to improve identification of individuals who have been affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. This will be accomplished by assessing biomarkers, such as immune and miRNA profiles, and by using neuroimaging techniques that may be more sensitive to subtle pathology seen in individuals who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for FAS. In addition, CIFASD will develop novel tools, such as 3D facial and neurobehavioral screening, which can be assessed remotely and made more universally accessible through eHealth. The use of telemedicine will also provide access to more detailed dysmorphology evaluations. Another goal is to identify risk and resiliency factors, including genetic influences that will help with understanding the mechanisms of alcohol's damaging effects and also lead to more targeted interventions. A third goal is to better understand the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on consequences across the lifespan, including adulthood. Finally, an intervention for improving outcomes will be modified to a mobile platform, so that it can reach larger populations of individuals with FASD and their families. Collectively, these projects have the potential for moving the FASD field forward, improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD and serving a wide audience with the technologies available in eHealth. The Specific Aims of the AdminC are to: 1) Provide scientific and administrative direction, leadership and oversight to CIFASD; 2) Facilitate communication among the various projects and the dissemination of results; 3) Assist with data management strategies; 4) Provide annual evaluations of progress; and 5) Provide assistance to projects with implementing eHealth technology. The AdminC provides the foundation for the interactive and supportive framework of CIFASD by establishing regular communications with all members through monthly conference calls and biannual meetings; leading the Steering Committee in the establishment and implementation of CIFASD priorities and policies; supporting the Science Advisory Board with its evaluations of progress on each component as well as the overall mission of CIFASD; as well as serving as the liaison between the consortium's project scientists and its NIAAA advisors. Project Narrative The consequences resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure are wide-ranging and a major and costly public health problem. The goal of the CIFASD consortium is to enhance the identification and treatment of FASD utilizing a multidisciplinary approach consisting of both basic science and clinical research. The collaborations among research projects will allow CIFASD to improve the diagnosis and treatment of FASD, moving the field forward in ways that could not be easily achieved by individual projects.",Administrative Core of the CIFASD,9524807,U24AA014811,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Charge', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Dissemination', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Physical assessment', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Progress Reports', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'data management', 'diagnostic screening', 'drinking', 'eHealth', 'epidemiology study', 'fetal', 'forging', 'health care service', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'meetings', 'member', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outreach', 'pre-clinical research', 'program dissemination', 'recruit', 'repository', 'resilience', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web site']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U24,2018,428830,35319116,0.255405033602727
"Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure Abstract As a constitutent component of CIFASD4, this project will focus on earlier detection of the neurofacial effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four topics of the Request for Application (RFA) will be targeted: a) improved FAS/FASD facial recognition through 3D photography and computer analyses in individuals of different age groups; b) the utility of prenatal ultrasound as a screening or diagnostic modality; c) 3D facial imaging during the neonatal period to detect more subtle facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure; d) innovative uses of technologies, including handheld devices with apps, to screen for dysmorphology. Previously, we have implemented methods and associated software for analyzing postnatal face shape for the detection of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Although effective in their accuracy, they rely on the use of expensive and relatively clumsy 3D cameras for which not insignificant training is required. New methods of 2D image analysis are available, mobile device acquisition of 3D images is imminent and online recruitment to clinical research is becoming more common place. Finally, state-of-the-art machine learning methods are proving effective in large-scale analysis of ultrasound and MRI data. To accomplish our goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Automated screening of facial images for effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with potential for on-line and  mobile device use and integration of genetic, behavioral and cognitive data; 2. Fetal ultrasound analysis to detect facial, cranial and neural effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with  neonatal follow-up; 3.

"3/3 Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV – Intervention Research Arm (ARCH-IRA) Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs) and hazardous drinking are the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the US and are responsible for 10% of all deaths among working age adults. Among Persons Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH), heavy alcohol use is up to twice the rate in the general population. Few people engage in behavioral alcohol treatment and alcohol pharmacotherapies are not routinely used as part of alcohol treatment, despite the known efficacy of these interventions. PLWH engaged in treatment for their HIV disease have regular contact with a medical provider and are treated in a medical home model in which all medical services are delivered within HIV clinics, but few HIV providers feel comfortable treating AUDs. During our initial funding period, we implemented routine alcohol screening, developed a computerized brief intervention (CBI), and conducted provider training on alcohol pharmacotherapies. However, while we found a strong impact from routine screening with CBI for reducing alcohol use, few providers prescribed alcohol pharmacotherapy, despite this specialized training, with most indicating continued discomfort and lack of knowledge for use of pharmacotherapy. Algorithms are used routinely to guide providers in treatment selection for many different disorders that are not within their specialty such as diabetes management, obesity, arthritis, and other disorders. In addition, we tested the use of provider algorithms for the treatment of depression and smoking with PLWH and demonstrated increased utilization of these medications. For this renewal, we are proposing an implementation science test of using an algorithm that will build upon our success with CBI and integrate alcohol pharmacotherapies and other behavioral therapies within routine treatment. A decision-tree algorithm that provides more intensive treatments, including alcohol pharmacotherapies, that is also responsive to comorbidities such as depressive or anxiety symptoms will be tested in three HIV clinics across CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS). Primary outcomes include reduced alcohol consumption and frequency, improved HIV outcomes, and improvement in comorbid conditions. We will also examine provider, staff, patient, and clinic-level facilitators and barriers to implementation of this algorithm in routine clinical care. Successful implementation of this treatment approach would have considerable impact on reducing AUDs among PLWH and could be integrated within existing electronic health record systems for a sustainable model of alcohol treatment delivery to other HIV clinics. Hazardous alcohol use is the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the United States and is up to twice as high among PLWH. Algorithms have been developed to increase the efficacy of the treatment of chronic diseases with tremendous success but have never been empirically tested to aid in alcohol use disorders (AUDs). We propose to test an algorithm developed to aid providers in selecting behavioral and pharmacotherapy for the treatment of AUDs for PLWH engaged in care.",3/3 Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV – Intervention Research Arm (ARCH-IRA),9335217,U01AA020802,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Achievement', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Arthritis', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Trees', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Geography', 'HIV', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hepatitis C', 'Home environment', 'Hypertension', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Maintenance', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol screening', 'alcohol services', 'alcohol use disorder', 'anxiety symptoms', 'arm', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brief alcohol intervention', 'brief intervention', 'clinical care', 'computerized', 'consumption measures', 'depressive symptoms', 'diabetes management', 'drinking', 'evidence base', 'hazardous drinking', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'primary outcome', 'reduced alcohol use', 'screening', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'transmission process', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,U01,2017,368340,325573502,0.09430229952726572
"A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Project Summary This request for a renewal of funding is in response to the NIH/NIAAA funding opportunity entitled, “Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)” (RFA-AA-17-007). The overarching aim of the current proposal is to develop, validate, and implement clinically novel and innovative measurement tools to accurately identify children who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. The proposed study is relevant to the overall objective of the CIFASD funding opportunity “to accelerate specific areas of research related to the translation of new or improved capabilities in FASD clinical case recognition.” This is critical need. While there has been a concerted research effort since the initial clinical delineation of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), understanding the full spectrum of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure remains incomplete, hindering effective intervention. Although individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure may experience significantly impairing functional difficulties, identification of these individuals is inadequate. High rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis result in lost opportunities for intervention and misunderstanding of the etiology of observed difficulties. Development of accurate and specific identification tools will improve diagnostic capability and clinical decision-making regarding treatment. To this end, during previous funding periods we substantially enhanced the understanding of the specificity of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure to increase identification of alcohol-affected youth. Our hierarchical CIFASD Decision Tree, developed and validated on over 800 subjects, indicates that administration of just 4 measures can distinguish alcohol-affected youth from nonexposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions with accuracy rates of >80%. While a significant step forward, the Decision Tree was developed and validated in a research sample with a high risk of alcohol effects. One aim of the current proposal is to develop and test an electronic version of the Decision Tree (the eTree) in lower risk, international, population-based, and clinic-based samples. Another aim of the proposal, in line with the specific RFA goal to use innovative technologies to screen for dysmorphology and/or neurobehavioral deficits to aid in the identification of alcohol-exposed individuals, is the development and implementation of the FASD Online Neurobehavioral Screen (FONS), a web-based neurobehavioral assessment tool for use with subjects recruited via a web portal (cf. Foroud U01). The FONS will measure domains known to be affected in FASD, including those represented in diagnostic criteria for neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE). The eTree and the FONS will be validated using laboratory-based in-person neuropsychological assessment of children with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure and non-exposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions. The results of the proposed research will fulfill our research goals, improve recruitment, and most importantly accurately identify individuals affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, leading to improved clinical diagnosis and intervention. Project Narrative This project is directly relevant to public health concerns related to the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and improved identification of alcohol-affected individuals with novel electronic data collection techniques. Improved identification methods and delineation of features related to alcohol-exposure will ultimately lead to improved treatment and help alleviate the public health burden associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.",A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,9391516,U01AA014834,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'California', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neuropsychology', 'Online Systems', 'Outpatients', 'Persons', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Self-Administered', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Ukraine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Youth', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'effective intervention', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'first grade', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'mobile application', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'novel', 'population based', 'response', 'screening', 'tool', 'web portal']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2017,379702,35319116,0.30541214109542386
"Administrative Core of the CIFASD Project Summary/Abstract The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is a multidisciplinary, international consortium of research projects and resource cores charged with improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD. The Administrative Resource Core of the CIFASD (AdminC) has led this consortium since it was first established in 2003 and plays a critical leadership role in the coordination of research efforts and ensuring progress toward consortium goals. CIFASD addresses issues related to prenatal alcohol exposure across the lifespan, using a range of interrelated clinical and preclinical research approaches. This iteration of the consortium consists of multiple collaborative components including four resource U24 cores (AdminC, Dysmorphology, Informatics, and Outreach/Dissemination), nine U01 research projects (clinical, basic science, and/or translational) and two exploratory/developmental UH2 projects. One goal of the CIFASD is to improve identification of individuals who have been affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. This will be accomplished by assessing biomarkers, such as immune and miRNA profiles, and by using neuroimaging techniques that may be more sensitive to subtle pathology seen in individuals who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for FAS. In addition, CIFASD will develop novel tools, such as 3D facial and neurobehavioral screening, which can be assessed remotely and made more universally accessible through eHealth. The use of telemedicine will also provide access to more detailed dysmorphology evaluations. Another goal is to identify risk and resiliency factors, including genetic influences that will help with understanding the mechanisms of alcohol's damaging effects and also lead to more targeted interventions. A third goal is to better understand the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on consequences across the lifespan, including adulthood. Finally, an intervention for improving outcomes will be modified to a mobile platform, so that it can reach larger populations of individuals with FASD and their families. Collectively, these projects have the potential for moving the FASD field forward, improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD and serving a wide audience with the technologies available in eHealth. The Specific Aims of the AdminC are to: 1) Provide scientific and administrative direction, leadership and oversight to CIFASD; 2) Facilitate communication among the various projects and the dissemination of results; 3) Assist with data management strategies; 4) Provide annual evaluations of progress; and 5) Provide assistance to projects with implementing eHealth technology. The AdminC provides the foundation for the interactive and supportive framework of CIFASD by establishing regular communications with all members through monthly conference calls and biannual meetings; leading the Steering Committee in the establishment and implementation of CIFASD priorities and policies; supporting the Science Advisory Board with its evaluations of progress on each component as well as the overall mission of CIFASD; as well as serving as the liaison between the consortium's project scientists and its NIAAA advisors. Project Narrative The consequences resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure are wide-ranging and a major and costly public health problem. The goal of the CIFASD consortium is to enhance the identification and treatment of FASD utilizing a multidisciplinary approach consisting of both basic science and clinical research. The collaborations among research projects will allow CIFASD to improve the diagnosis and treatment of FASD, moving the field forward in ways that could not be easily achieved by individual projects.",Administrative Core of the CIFASD,9390289,U24AA014811,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Charge', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Dissemination', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Physical assessment', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Progress Reports', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'data management', 'diagnostic screening', 'drinking', 'eHealth', 'epidemiology study', 'fetal', 'forging', 'health care service', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'meetings', 'member', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outreach', 'pre-clinical research', 'program dissemination', 'repository', 'resilience', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web site']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U24,2017,401580,35319116,0.255405033602727
"A diagnostic plasma protein panel for alcohol abuse DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol abuse and alcoholism remain significant societal problems. Unfortunately, treatment for and monitoring of harmful alcohol consumption is hampered by the lack of a highly accurate diagnostic test of alcohol drinking behavior. Our long-term goal for this research project is to develop biomarkers of alcohol abuse for use in at- risk populations. In particular, we have identified highly sensitive and specific plasma protein biomarkers using a well-controlled nonhuman primate model of alcohol abuse. We propose, in this application to translate these findings from the nonhuman primate into potential diagnostic tools for monitoring alcohol abuse in humans. This will be undertaken in collaboration with three clinical sites around the world. Specifically, we will obtain de- identified clinical samples from he Coatesville Veterans Affairs Medical Center, the Yale University School of Medicine, and the Institute for Health and Welfare of Finland (Helsinki, Finland). Studies associated with this research program will be divided into two specific aims. Specific aim 1 will validate a novel plasma biomarker panel in recovering alcoholics. In this aim, our clinical collaborators (from Yale and the Coatesville VAMC) will provide anonymous, within-subject longitudinal samples from subjects undergoing withdrawal and early abstinence (21 to 28 days) from abusive drinking as well as from the general population. These well-annotated samples will be used to refine the list of 27 biomarkers to identify the set that is most diagnostic of the human drinking phenotype and withdrawal/ abstinence. These experiments will employ a multiplex quantitative solution-phase immunoassay designed for human analytes (Myriad RBM DiscoveryMAP v1.0). As with all biomarker discovery projects, our primary emphasis will be on identifying a plasma protein analyte panel with high sensitivity and specificity. Specific aim 2 will then refine the plasma biomarker panel to permit diagnosis of hazardous drinking in a cross-sectional population from multiple sites. Within- subject assessment of drinking behavior (Aim #1) is much easier because the test does not compare differing baseline physiologies. Requirements for general population screening are much more stringent and will be assessed in samples from three independent sites (Yale University, Coatesville PA Veterans Administration Medical Center and the Finland National Institute for Health and Welfare). These sites provide a rich number of samples and drinking behaviors from which to draw experimental cohorts. In summary, we believe this work is innovative in that it capitalizes on new concepts in biomarker development through the identification of novel targets. The specific aims will build on preceding successes in the nonhuman primate model by characterization of human samples. All of the proposed studies will involve correlation with normal clinical and psychosocial assessments of alcohol consumption (AUDIT self-reports;  percentCDT, AST/ALT, GGT, etc.). In addition, because we are not using unitary biomarker measures, we will apply sophisticated biostatistical approaches (random forest, support vector machine, principle component analysis) to the data analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A shortcoming of current approaches to diagnosing and treating alcohol abuse and alcoholism is that we have no reliable, objective clinical markers of drinking behavior. We have identified and patented a panel of plasma proteins that accurately classify alcohol consumption levels in non-human primates and have also identified alcohol-induced changes in the plasma proteome common to both non-human primates and humans in a published pilot clinical study. The proposed project will translate these important findings into a refined human diagnostic in collaboration with an FDA-approved clinical partner (Myriad RBM). Therefore, these studies provide an opportunity to have a dramatic and immediate impact on our ability to address the unmet medical needs of alcohol abuse and alcoholism.",A diagnostic plasma protein panel for alcohol abuse,9035335,R01AA021661,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'FDA approved', 'Finland', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Immunoassay', 'Institutes', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Site', 'Social Welfare', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Typology', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Veterans', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'alcohol research', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'forest', 'hazardous drinking', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'named group', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'protein biomarkers', 'research study', 'screening', 'success', 'tool']",NIAAA,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2016,344250,68045551,0.1680922025206718

"Microfluidics-Enabled High-Throughput Studies on Early Embryonic Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prenatal alcohol exposure causes a range of developmental disorders that are commonly referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). The most severe case of FASDs is known as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and is characterized by growth deficiencies, craniofacial malformations, and both structural and functional central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities. The combination of technological limitations that decrease experimental throughput and the inherent stochasticity of biological processes eliminate the ability to gain a quantitative understanding about the onset and progression of ethanol-related developmental disorders. As a result there is not much known mechanistically about how ethanol exposure manifests as FASDs. Here, we aim to develop a microfluidic-based system that enables high-throughput and high-content studies to elucidate the effects of ethanol exposure on embryogenesis. The model organism Drosophila melanogaster (Drosophila) has been shown to be a model of FASDs, because Drosophila exhibits similar phenotypical defects as humans when embryos are raised on ethanol solutions. It has yet to be seen how ethanol exposure affects developmental processes that occur during embryogenesis that lead to the wide ranging symptoms of FASDs. The technological gap that precedes this is a method that can robustly expose developing fly embryos to ethanol while also allowing high-throughput live imaging and data acquisition. The objective of this project is to develop enabling technologies for whole embryo imaging to uncover the mechanisms through which embryonic ethanol exposure affects morphogenesis and developmental patterning that ultimately lead to FASDs. In order to address the technological gap we are developing a microfluidic system that can culture and expose live Drosophila embryos to ethanol in a highly-parallelized manner. This system will also enable live imaging of embryogenesis, so that we can better understand how ethanol exposure affects morphogenesis. Furthermore, the microfluidic system will be integrated with tissue clearing techniques that will enable whole embryo imaging and thus allow us to visualize whole embryo gene expression patterns. In this study, we will study mutants of key enzymes to better elucidate their roles in FASD. Using this device, I aim to better our understanding about the physical and gene expression changes involved with FASDs. Microfluidic systems will be integrated with computer automation programs that will increase data acquisition rates.

"A diagnostic plasma protein panel for alcohol abuse DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol abuse and alcoholism remain significant societal problems. Unfortunately, treatment for and monitoring of harmful alcohol consumption is hampered by the lack of a highly accurate diagnostic test of alcohol drinking behavior. Our long-term goal for this research project is to develop biomarkers of alcohol abuse for use in at- risk populations. In particular, we have identified highly sensitive and specific plasma protein biomarkers using a well-controlled nonhuman primate model of alcohol abuse. We propose, in this application to translate these findings from the nonhuman primate into potential diagnostic tools for monitoring alcohol abuse in humans. This will be undertaken in collaboration with three clinical sites around the world. Specifically, we will obtain de- identified clinical samples from he Coatesville Veterans Affairs Medical Center, the Yale University School of Medicine, and the Institute for Health and Welfare of Finland (Helsinki, Finland). Studies associated with this research program will be divided into two specific aims. Specific aim 1 will validate a novel plasma biomarker panel in recovering alcoholics. In this aim, our clinical collaborators (from Yale and the Coatesville VAMC) will provide anonymous, within-subject longitudinal samples from subjects undergoing withdrawal and early abstinence (21 to 28 days) from abusive drinking as well as from the general population. These well-annotated samples will be used to refine the list of 27 biomarkers to identify the set that is most diagnostic of the human drinking phenotype and withdrawal/ abstinence. These experiments will employ a multiplex quantitative solution-phase immunoassay designed for human analytes (Myriad RBM DiscoveryMAP v1.0). As with all biomarker discovery projects, our primary emphasis will be on identifying a plasma protein analyte panel with high sensitivity and specificity. Specific aim 2 will then refine the plasma biomarker panel to permit diagnosis of hazardous drinking in a cross-sectional population from multiple sites. Within- subject assessment of drinking behavior (Aim #1) is much easier because the test does not compare differing baseline physiologies. Requirements for general population screening are much more stringent and will be assessed in samples from three independent sites (Yale University, Coatesville PA Veterans Administration Medical Center and the Finland National Institute for Health and Welfare). These sites provide a rich number of samples and drinking behaviors from which to draw experimental cohorts. In summary, we believe this work is innovative in that it capitalizes on new concepts in biomarker development through the identification of novel targets. The specific aims will build on preceding successes in the nonhuman primate model by characterization of human samples. All of the proposed studies will involve correlation with normal clinical and psychosocial assessments of alcohol consumption (AUDIT self-reports;  percentCDT, AST/ALT, GGT, etc.). In addition, because we are not using unitary biomarker measures, we will apply sophisticated biostatistical approaches (random forest, support vector machine, principle component analysis) to the data analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A shortcoming of current approaches to diagnosing and treating alcohol abuse and alcoholism is that we have no reliable, objective clinical markers of drinking behavior. We have identified and patented a panel of plasma proteins that accurately classify alcohol consumption levels in non-human primates and have also identified alcohol-induced changes in the plasma proteome common to both non-human primates and humans in a published pilot clinical study. The proposed project will translate these important findings into a refined human diagnostic in collaboration with an FDA-approved clinical partner (Myriad RBM).

"Microfluidics-Enabled High-Throughput Studies on Early Embryonic Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prenatal alcohol exposure causes a range of developmental disorders that are commonly referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). The most severe case of FASDs is known as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and is characterized by growth deficiencies, craniofacial malformations, and both structural and functional central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities. The combination of technological limitations that decrease experimental throughput and the inherent stochasticity of biological processes eliminate the ability to gain a quantitative understanding about the onset and progression of ethanol-related developmental disorders. As a result there is not much known mechanistically about how ethanol exposure manifests as FASDs. Here, we aim to develop a microfluidic-based system that enables high-throughput and high-content studies to elucidate the effects of ethanol exposure on embryogenesis. The model organism Drosophila melanogaster (Drosophila) has been shown to be a model of FASDs, because Drosophila exhibits similar phenotypical defects as humans when embryos are raised on ethanol solutions. It has yet to be seen how ethanol exposure affects developmental processes that occur during embryogenesis that lead to the wide ranging symptoms of FASDs. The technological gap that precedes this is a method that can robustly expose developing fly embryos to ethanol while also allowing high-throughput live imaging and data acquisition. The objective of this project is to develop enabling technologies for whole embryo imaging to uncover the mechanisms through which embryonic ethanol exposure affects morphogenesis and developmental patterning that ultimately lead to FASDs. In order to address the technological gap we are developing a microfluidic system that can culture and expose live Drosophila embryos to ethanol in a highly-parallelized manner. This system will also enable live imaging of embryogenesis, so that we can better understand how ethanol exposure affects morphogenesis. Furthermore, the microfluidic system will be integrated with tissue clearing techniques that will enable whole embryo imaging and thus allow us to visualize whole embryo gene expression patterns. In this study, we will study mutants of key enzymes to better elucidate their roles in FASD. Using this device, I aim to better our understanding about the physical and gene expression changes involved with FASDs. Microfluidic systems will be integrated with computer automation programs that will increase data acquisition rates. Data analysis will be streamlined through the development of computer vision algorithms that will help identify phenotypical changes associated with ethanol exposure that are non-obvious and likely to be missed by manual annotation. This project will not only enlarge the repertoire of tools available for developmental biology in general, but also will have significant impact on ethanol teratology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this project is to develop a high-throughput, microfluidics-based system for studying the physical and genetic origins of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs).

"Validating NIAAA's brief screening guide in youth with chronic medical conditions     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to validate the NIAAA Guide with youth with chronic medical conditions (YCMC) to facilitate standardized screening and improve the response capability of physicians who regularly interact with them. YCMC are a large and expensive population uniquely vulnerable to harm from drinking given the potential for alcohol to negatively interact with both their underlying health condition and its treatment. We take a novel approach, collecting a battery of assessment information from 400 assented/consented youth (ages 9-18 years) being treated at Children's Hospital Boston for one of four target conditions (asthma, diabetes, a rheumatic disorder or ulcerative colitis; 100 each). Participants will complete an electronic version of the NIAAA guide and an assessment battery comprised of a structured diagnostic interview for alcohol use disorders, a measure of frequency/quantity of alcohol use; a brief interview about friends' use of alcohol and additional brief structured report about medication adherence, quality of life and depressive symptoms. Information on chronic disease status and alcohol risk factors will be obtained via chart review, with input from a team of clinical collaborators with domain expertise in target conditions. Specific Aims are to: Aim 1) validate an NIAAA-Guide based screening algorithm against gold standard measures of alcohol use disorders in the study population, testing the hypothesis that the Guide will yield sensitivity and specificity > .75 for correctly identifying the group of YCMC who have problematic use/ abuse or alcohol dependence. We will use the bootstrap method of re-sampling to estimate 95% confidence intervals about each measure of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values; Aim 2) Evaluate associations between alcohol risk categories established by the NIAAA Guide and measures of other substance use, chronic disease and overall health status and disease management testing hypotheses that (i) Youth with alcohol use problems or disorders will be more likely to use other substances, and will score significantly lower on measures of global health, treatment adherence and chronic disease status, and (ii) consideration of chronic disease- related alcohol risks expands the proportion of youth who fall within the problem use range. We will use Generalized Estimating Equations logistic regression analysis to identify significant differences among those with problem use, abuse and dependence vs. those without on scale scores and other continuous measures of global health and markers of chronic disease status, controlling for moderators and the complex sample design in which participants are nested within clinics and; Aim 3) Develop recommendations for clinician guidance and health messages for inclusion in the Guide for use with YCMC, generated in a modified Delphi process with 20 clinician experts and field tested with patients. Deliverables are a validated, electronic screening tool that triages YCMC into actionable risk groups, contains guidance and examples of field-tested, salient, alcohol related advice, and baseline measures and an initial cohort for a continued prospective study.         PROJECT NARRATIVE  Alcohol use is a serious health threat to the 26% youth in the US with chronic medical conditions. While alcohol use can significantly impact an underlying illness and its safe/effective management, medical specialists rarely screen their adolescent patients for alcohol use. We will validate a new, brief alcohol- screening tool with 9-18  year old youth with chronic medical conditions. Comprehensive assessment information will be collected and analyzed to describe relationships between youth alcohol use, other substance use, and chronic disease outcomes and findings integrated into the validated screen as actionable clinician guidance and health advice.",Validating NIAAA's brief screening guide in youth with chronic medical conditions,8692622,R01AA021913,"['16 year old', '18 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring', 'Boston', 'Boxing', 'Budgets', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Consent', 'Consumption', 'Dependence', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Outcome', 'Dose', 'Early identification', 'Electronics', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Equilibrium', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'High School Student', 'Home environment', 'Instruction', 'Insulin', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Logic', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Regression Analysis', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening Result', 'Self Care', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Workers', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Triage', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'adolescent alcohol', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol screening', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'brief alcohol screening', 'brief screening', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'drinking', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'global health', 'high risk', 'improved', 'medical specialist', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'meetings', 'neglect', 'novel strategies', 'peer', 'response', 'screening', 'social', 'standard measure', 'tool', 'treatment adherence']",NIAAA,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2014,379755,209484975,0.16924621054301953

"Validating NIAAA screening guide in YCMC - administrative supplement DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to validate the NIAAA Guide with youth with chronic medical conditions (YCMC) to facilitate standardized screening and improve the response capability of physicians who regularly interact with them. YCMC are a large and expensive population uniquely vulnerable to harm from drinking given the potential for alcohol to negatively interact with both their underlying health condition and its treatment. We take a novel approach, collecting a battery of assessment information from 400 assented/consented youth (ages 9-18 years) being treated at Children's Hospital Boston for one of four target conditions (asthma, diabetes, a rheumatic disorder or ulcerative colitis; 100 each). Participants will complete an electronic version of the NIAAA guide and an assessment battery comprised of a structured diagnostic interview for alcohol use disorders, a measure of frequency/quantity of alcohol use; a brief interview about friends' use of alcohol and additional brief structured report about medication adherence, quality of life and depressive symptoms. Information on chronic disease status and alcohol risk factors will be obtained via chart review, with input from a team of clinical collaborators with domain expertise in target conditions. Specific Aims are to: Aim 1) validate an NIAAA-Guide based screening algorithm against gold standard measures of alcohol use disorders in the study population, testing the hypothesis that the Guide will yield sensitivity and specificity > .75 for correctly identifying the group of YCMC who have problematic use/ abuse or alcohol dependence. We will use the bootstrap method of re-sampling to estimate 95% confidence intervals about each measure of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values; Aim 2) Evaluate associations between alcohol risk categories established by the NIAAA Guide and measures of other substance use, chronic disease and overall health status and disease management testing hypotheses that (i) Youth with alcohol use problems or disorders will be more likely to use other substances, and will score significantly lower on measures of global health, treatment adherence and chronic disease status, and (ii) consideration of chronic disease- related alcohol risks expands the proportion of youth who fall within the problem use range. We will use Generalized Estimating Equations logistic regression analysis to identify significant differences among those with problem use, abuse and dependence vs. those without on scale scores and other continuous measures of global health and markers of chronic disease status, controlling for moderators and the complex sample design in which participants are nested within clinics and; Aim 3) Develop recommendations for clinician guidance and health messages for inclusion in the Guide for use with YCMC, generated in a modified Delphi process with 20 clinician experts and field tested with patients. Deliverables are a validated, electronic screening tool that triages YCMC into actionable risk groups, contains guidance and examples of field-tested, salient, alcohol related advice, and baseline measures and an initial cohort for a continued prospective study.

"Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) occurs in children born to women who drink alcohol heavily during pregnancy and is one of the leading non-hereditary causes of mental retardation in the Western World. It is estimated that the prevalence of FAS in the general U.S. population is between 0.5 and 2.0 per 1,000 births, while the undiagnosed population with variable facial and brain dysmorphology described as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is estimated to be 10 times higher. The difficulty in the diagnosis of FASD involves misdiagnosis due to the presence or absence of the typical facial dysmorphology in association with brain dysfunction. Accurate diagnosis is further complicated by the lack of information about the contribution of dose, frequency, and timing of alcohol exposure during pregnancy to variation in facial dysmorphology. In this project, a mouse model that models human consumption and is known to produce FAS-like features resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure, will be used to test the effects of differences in dose and timing of alcohol exposure on face and brain development. A combination of 3D imaging that includes Micro-video and micro-resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to capture the detailed facial structure, micro-computational tomography (Micro-CT) to capture the underlying facial bone, MRI for detailed brain dimensions, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for nerve fiber tracks in the fetal period. A novel computational program will be compiled to detect features specifically as function of alcohol exposure. The association and dissociation of facial and brain dysmorphology as a function of dose and timing of alcohol exposure will be analyzed to better inform the diagnosis of FAS/ FASD. These studies will be a collaboration sharing resources and methods and will be performed across both Basic and Clinical Science components in consortium effort. To date there is no cure for FAS/FASD, which is a life long ordeal from the birth. Experimental tests, using the above model and setting, of trophic peptides which have been known to prevent neurodegeneration in trials for Alzheimer Disease and protect cell death in embryonic stage, have been partially tested in the embryonic period to show protection against the alcohol-induced retardation.

One of the overall goals of the entire CIFASD during this renewal period is to determine if innovative techniques can be used to identify brain alterations, neurobehavioral deficits and facial characteristics and relationships between these variables to help define prenatal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To help address this overarching question, we will use quantitative brain mapping techniques with high-resolution structural and functional MRI collected both cross-sectionally and longitudinally from 80 FASD children evaluated across 3 multi-cultural data collection sites (San Diego, Los Angeles and Capetown, South Africa). While this brain imaging project can independently achieve some of the goals of the CIFASD by identifying brain structural and functional abnormalities across the broad spectrum of FASD, critically this funding opportunity will allow the assessment of relationships between the brain, neurocognitive deficits and facial dysmorphology through our active collaborations with the neurobehavioral project (Mattson PI), the facial imaging project (Foroud PI), and the dysmorphology core (Jones PI). Controlled animal studies are essential to determine timing and dosages of prenatal alcohol that result in FASD, but human imaging studies are essential to corroborate anatomical findings across species. Through our association with the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, we have access to state-of-the-art brain mapping tools that allow the morphological evaluation of any brain structure that can be identified with MRI. Thus, we are in a unique position to allow findings in animal studies to drive hypothesis-based analyses in the human imaging data. The proposed longitudinal project will highlight how an integrated approach relating neurobehavioral, functional and structural brain imaging data, and measures of facial morphology might yield important new insights on the complex nature of brain-behavior interactions and how they are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to undertake such challenges, and participation, in the CIFASD is essential to address our specific aims.

"Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), first described in the U.S. in 1973 by Jones and Smith, encompasses a pattern of structural abnormalities, growth deficiency, and neurobehavioral impairment that occurs in the offspring of women who consume moderate to heavy amounts of alcohol in pregnancy. FASD is thought to represent the leading known preventable causes of neurobehavioral impairment in the U.S. and perhaps throughout the world. The proposed study offers the opportunity within the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) consortium of projects to describe the spectrum of alcoholrelated effects, to identify risk factors that are antecedent to pregnancy outcome, to test within-pregnancy interventions, and also to test methods that will allow for earlier identification of alcohol-related birth outcomes. Specifically, the proposed research will utilize a prospective cohort study design involving pregnant women and their offspring recruited in Russia and Ukraine to address major gaps in knowledge about FASD by accomplishing the following specific aims: 1) to more fully delineate the complete range of expression of FASD in relation to specific quantities, patterns and gestational timing of alcohol exposure, and to evaluate the sensitivity of methods for earlier recognition of affected children; 2) to assess the contribution of maternal nutritional status in relation to physical and neurobehavioral outcomes associated with prenatal alcohol exposure, and to test the benefit of maternal second and third trimester supplementation with multinutrients with or without choline with respect to risk for FASD in the offspring; and 3) in collaboration with other CIFASD investigators, to provide a well-characterized sample of mothers/children with and without prenatal exposure to alcohol for testing of alternative and earlier methods of identifying affected children, including prenatal ultrasound and post-natal 3D facial imaging. The proposed research has public health relevance from the standpoint of providing an improved estimate of the magnitude and scope of alcoholrelated developmental problems in the context of specific quantities and patterns of prenatal alcohol exposure using standardized methods for assessment, and from the standpoint of developing and validating critically necessary clinical methods for improved and early recognition of affected children and testing the potential benefit of a reasonably applied prenatal intervention that may help ameliorate negative outcomes.          n/a",Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine,8121650,U01AA014835,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional status', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Russia', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'alcohol testing', 'analog', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal intervention', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2011,521526,524978793,0.2759147133359443

"Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) occurs in children born to women who drink alcohol heavily during pregnancy and is one of the leading non-hereditary causes of mental retardation in the Western World. It is estimated that the prevalence of FAS in the general U.S. population is between 0.5 and 2.0 per 1,000 births, while the undiagnosed population with variable facial and brain dysmorphology described as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is estimated to be 10 times higher. The difficulty in the diagnosis of FASD involves misdiagnosis due to the presence or absence of the typical facial dysmorphology in association with brain dysfunction. Accurate diagnosis is further complicated by the lack of information about the contribution of dose, frequency, and timing of alcohol exposure during pregnancy to variation in facial dysmorphology. In this project, a mouse model that models human consumption and is known to produce FAS-like features resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure, will be used to test the effects of differences in dose and timing of alcohol exposure on face and brain development. A combination of 3D imaging that includes Micro-video and micro-resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to capture the detailed facial structure, micro-computational tomography (Micro-CT) to capture the underlying facial bone, MRI for detailed brain dimensions, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for nerve fiber tracks in the fetal period. A novel computational program will be compiled to detect features specifically as function of alcohol exposure. The association and dissociation of facial and brain dysmorphology as a function of dose and timing of alcohol exposure will be analyzed to better inform the diagnosis of FAS/ FASD. These studies will be a collaboration sharing resources and methods and will be performed across both Basic and Clinical Science components in consortium effort. To date there is no cure for FAS/FASD, which is a life long ordeal from the birth. Experimental tests, using the above model and setting, of trophic peptides which have been known to prevent neurodegeneration in trials for Alzheimer Disease and protect cell death in embryonic stage, have been partially tested in the embryonic period to show protection against the alcohol-induced retardation. The new studies will test whether the trophic peptides can prevent alcohol-induced brain and facial dysmorphology as well as behavioral impairment known to occur in FAS.          n/a",Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies,7905111,U01AA017123,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Cartilage', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Dissociation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Length', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Retardation', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'NAPVSIPQ peptide', 'Neonatal', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'New Mexico', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeleton', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Vibrissae', 'Western World', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'behavioral impairment', 'bone', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain volume', 'clinical application', 'cognitive control', 'craniofacial', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'digital imaging', 'drinking', 'face bone structure', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'longitudinal design', 'morphometry', 'morris water maze', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotrophic factor', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'peptide analog', 'postnatal', 'pregnant', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory cortex', 'social', 'tomography', 'translational study', 'young adult']",NIAAA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2010,242494,232986943,0.28374300869232894
"MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), significant components of which are Central Nervous System (CMS) and craniofacial abnormalities, are a major public health problem. While eliminating FASD is the ultimate goal for both clinical and basic FASD research, we recognize that in the near future, adverse effects from prenatal ethanol exposure will persist. To better diagnose and treat affected individuals, a more complete understanding of the full spectrum of the ethanol-induced abnormalities is needed. The proposed investigations are designed to integrate with those of other consortium members in meeting this need. For this work, both high resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which can provide 29 micron (or less) isotropic scans and subsequent accurate 3-D reconstructions and segmental analyses, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), which allows CMS fiber tract analyses, will be applied to the study of an FASD mouse model. Previous research utilizing this model has established critical exposure times that yield facial and CNS abnormalities that are consistent with full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, as well as other components of FASD. The proposed studies will employ this model and both acute and chronic ethanol treatment paradigms to test the overall hypothesis that in mice, ethanol induces structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are consistent with and informative for those in human FASD. To this end, utilizing MRI and DTI as high throughput screening platforms, we propose to address the following specific aims : 1) to provide comprehensive documentation and discovery of the ethanol-induced CNS dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure at embryonic and early fetal stages of development; 2) to define the facial dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure during embryonic and/or early fetal stages and to relate their character and severity to accompanying abnormalities of the brain; and 3) to identify regions other than the brain or face that may serve as diagnostic indicators of prenatal ethanol exposure. The results of the proposed studies will be compared to those of corresponding investigations by other consortium members. It is expected that the structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are induced by ethanol in mice will reflect the pattern of defects observed in children with FASD, will inform human diagnostic tests, and will provide new information that will be helpful in reducing the incidence of FASD. n/a",MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01,7900037,U01AA017124,"['3-Dimensional', 'A Mouse', 'Acoustic Nerve', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease model', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fertilization', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetus', 'Fiber', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Hearing Tests', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Labyrinth', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Menstruation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nasal septum structure', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproduction', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'computer generated', 'craniofacial', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'high throughput screening', 'human data', 'human subject', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'interest', 'intraperitoneal', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'meetings', 'member', 'membranous labyrinth', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'sensory system', 'social', 'symposium', 'three dimensional structure', 'web site']",NIAAA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2010,242586,511185245,0.2182498421678354
"Translational Studies of FASD Using a Sheep Model-U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The main goals of this consortium are to identify sources of variation in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) phenotypes (facial dysmorphology, structural brain damage and neurobehavioral functional deficits), to advance understanding of structure-function relationships, to improve diagnosis and early identification of FASD, and to develop early interventions that may limit adverse outcomes in at-risk pregnancies. Animal models are essential to those goals. This project proposes a novel sheep model that is especially well suited for experimental translational studies of FASD. In utero brain development in sheep matches human brain development relatively well, and prenatal binge alcohol exposure in sheep produces brain and behavioral effects consistent with FASD. There are two long-term objectives for this project. The first is to use the sheep model to compare the effects of binge-like alcohol exposure during the period of brain development comparable to that of the human first trimester (1st-trimester mode/) with similar binge-like exposure that extends over the stages of brain development encompassing all three human trimesters (3-trimester model). These studies evaluate phenotypic measures used in the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome-growth, facial dysmorphology, and brain and behavioral development-using methods derived explicitly from and collaboratively linked directly to approaches applied in the human components of the consortium. These studies test the general hypothesis that more pervasive effects on brain and neurobehavioral development will result from binge exposure that continues after the first trimester. Aim 1 will evaluate growth, facial morphometry, and effects on in vivo brain regional volumes using structural magnetic resonance imaging. Aim 2 will assess neurobehavioral outcomes using eyeblink classical conditioning and spatial working memory. Aim 3 will assess neuroanatomical effects via neuronal counts in the cerebellum, hippocampal formation, and brainstem serotonin system. These studies are designed to inter-relate with and reciprocally inform four of the human projects [Facial Imaging (Foroud), Brain Imaging (Sowell), Neurobehavioral project (Mattson), and the Risk Factors/Nutrition project (Chambers)] and the two mouse basic science projects (Zhou; Sulik). The second objective (Aim 4) is to test the hypothesis that choline supplementation initiated periconceptually will attenuate the adverse effects of alcohol exposure in the 3-trimester sheep model. This study was designed with explicit and complementary collaboration with the choline-supplementation projects in rats [the basic science developmental project using rats (Thomas)] and in humans [Risk Factor/Nutrition project of Chambers/Keen]. This sheep model provides a unique opportunity to bridge the basic and clinical arms of the consortium more closely than has been achieved in the past.           n/a",Translational Studies of FASD Using a Sheep Model-U01,7906056,U01AA017120,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attenuated', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blinking', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar Nuclei', 'Cerebellum', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hippocampal Formation', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microcephaly', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serotonin', 'Severities', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'arm', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain volume', 'classical conditioning', 'cognitive control', 'conditioning', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'dentate gyrus', 'design', 'drinking', 'fetal diagnosis', 'follow-up', 'granule cell', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'morphometry', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neuron loss', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'offspring', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'research study', 'social', 'species difference', 'three dimensional structure', 'translational study']",NIAAA,TEXAS A&M AGRILIFE RESEARCH,U01,2010,272554,20014175,0.21641510501366484
"Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"". One of the overall goals of the entire CIFASD during this renewal period is to determine if innovative techniques can be used to identify brain alterations, neurobehavioral deficits and facial characteristics and relationships between these variables to help define prenatal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To help address this overarching question, we will use quantitative brain mapping techniques with high-resolution structural and functional MRI collected both cross-sectionally and longitudinally from 80 FASD children evaluated across 3 multi-cultural data collection sites (San Diego, Los Angeles and Capetown, South Africa). While this brain imaging project can independently achieve some of the goals of the CIFASD by identifying brain structural and functional abnormalities across the broad spectrum of FASD, critically this funding opportunity will allow the assessment of relationships between the brain, neurocognitive deficits and facial dysmorphology through our active collaborations with the neurobehavioral project (Mattson PI), the facial imaging project (Foroud PI), and the dysmorphology core (Jones PI). Controlled animal studies are essential to determine timing and dosages of prenatal alcohol that result in FASD, but human imaging studies are essential to corroborate anatomical findings across species. Through our association with the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, we have access to state-of-the-art brain mapping tools that allow the morphological evaluation of any brain structure that can be identified with MRI. Thus, we are in a unique position to allow findings in animal studies to drive hypothesis-based analyses in the human imaging data. The proposed longitudinal project will highlight how an integrated approach relating neurobehavioral, functional and structural brain imaging data, and measures of facial morphology might yield important new insights on the complex nature of brain-behavior interactions and how they are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to undertake such challenges, and participation, in the CIFASD is essential to address our specific aims. Ultimately, as part of the CIFASD, this project will enhance the capability for definitive FASD diagnoses that, in turn, will help clinicians manage and treat neurobehavioral deficits and associated secondary disabilities.           n/a","Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)",7900036,U01AA017122,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disorder by Site', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Productivity', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Verbal Learning', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain size', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'disability', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2010,498276,673201228,0.20472897095335862
"Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), first described in the U.S. in 1973 by Jones and Smith, encompasses a pattern of structural abnormalities, growth deficiency, and neurobehavioral impairment that occurs in the offspring of women who consume moderate to heavy amounts of alcohol in pregnancy. FASD is thought to represent the leading known preventable causes of neurobehavioral impairment in the U.S. and perhaps throughout the world. The proposed study offers the opportunity within the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) consortium of projects to describe the spectrum of alcoholrelated effects, to identify risk factors that are antecedent to pregnancy outcome, to test within-pregnancy interventions, and also to test methods that will allow for earlier identification of alcohol-related birth outcomes. Specifically, the proposed research will utilize a prospective cohort study design involving pregnant women and their offspring recruited in Russia and Ukraine to address major gaps in knowledge about FASD by accomplishing the following specific aims: 1) to more fully delineate the complete range of expression of FASD in relation to specific quantities, patterns and gestational timing of alcohol exposure, and to evaluate the sensitivity of methods for earlier recognition of affected children; 2) to assess the contribution of maternal nutritional status in relation to physical and neurobehavioral outcomes associated with prenatal alcohol exposure, and to test the benefit of maternal second and third trimester supplementation with multinutrients with or without choline with respect to risk for FASD in the offspring; and 3) in collaboration with other CIFASD investigators, to provide a well-characterized sample of mothers/children with and without prenatal exposure to alcohol for testing of alternative and earlier methods of identifying affected children, including prenatal ultrasound and post-natal 3D facial imaging. The proposed research has public health relevance from the standpoint of providing an improved estimate of the magnitude and scope of alcoholrelated developmental problems in the context of specific quantities and patterns of prenatal alcohol exposure using standardized methods for assessment, and from the standpoint of developing and validating critically necessary clinical methods for improved and early recognition of affected children and testing the potential benefit of a reasonably applied prenatal intervention that may help ameliorate negative outcomes.          n/a",Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine,7900032,U01AA014835,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional status', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Russia', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'alcohol testing', 'analog', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal intervention', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2010,579374,524978793,0.2759147133359443
"A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"" (Notice RFA-AA-03-004) to continue and expand the current multidisciplinary CIFASD. This RFA calls for, in part, research aimed at ""improved diagnosis"" and ""enhanced understanding of the domains of neurobehavioral impairment"" of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Although 30 years of research have identified myriad deficits in individuals with FASD, most neuropsychological studies are plagued by the question of global dysfunction vs. a pattern of relative sparing and impaired function. Delineation of a neuropsychological profile has been the subject of much recent debate. Limited research, including the current CIFASD consortium, has examined if prenatal alcohol exposure results in general dysfunction or a more specific neurobehavioral profile of strengths and weaknesses. The primary aim of this project is to determine whether a neurobehavioral phenotype exists in children with fetal alcohol syndrome, whether the same phenotype exists in children with FASD who lack facial dysmorphology, and whether the phenotype can be used for differential diagnosis. Secondary aims, involving collaboration with other CIFASD projects and cores, are to determine the relationship between brain dysmorphology, facial dysmorphology, and neurobehavioral function. These aims are in keeping with the overall aims of the CIFASD, including enhanced understanding of the neurobehavioral phenotype and establishment of standardized diagnostic criteria and methods of assessment of FASD. A standard neurobehavioral protocol will be administered to four groups of children at six sites and will address the functional domains of executive function, working memory, verbal function, and psychological symptomatology. In addition to children with FASD and nonexposed controls, children with low IQ scores or ADHD will be included as contrast samples. Using this heterogeneous sample and multivariate statistical methods, neurobehavioral profile specific to FASD will be sought. In addition, participants will be assessed using methodology prescribed by the Dysmorphology Core and the facial and brain imaging projects of the CIFASD. Data from three broad domains (neurobehavior, dysmorphology, and brain morphology and function) will be analyzed both separately and together to address the main aim of the CIFASD: improving the diagnostic criteria for FASD. This project is directly relevant to public health concerns surrounding the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, improving diagnosis of alcohol-affected individuals, and defining the profile of neurobehavioral effects that are specific to FASD. Improved identification and delineation of these features will ultimately lead to improved treatment.           n/a",A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,7850069,U01AA014834,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plague', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'statistics', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2009,40808,35319116,0.2812131297450563
"Alcohol Screening Scores and Medical Outcomes:  Age and Gender Influences    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite extensive epidemiological evidence linking alcohol consumption and health, few studies have evaluated whether validated alcohol screening questionnaires employed in clinical practice can be used to assess patients' level of risk for adverse alcohol-related medical outcomes. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test- Consumption (AUDIT-C) is a brief screen for alcohol misuse designed and validated for use in primary care settings1-6. For men, preliminary evidence links AUDIT-C scores to subsequent medical diagnoses that are the consequences of both chronic alcohol use (e.g., liver disease, upper GI bleeding, and pancreatitis) 7, and acute alcohol use (e.g., traumatic injury)8, 9, as well as to mortality10. However, the association between AUDIT-C scores and health problems in women is unknown. Also, research has found that the link between AUDIT-C scores and medical outcomes varies substantially by age10, 11, but the relatively small sample sizes in studies to date have permitted only evaluation of three broad age groups (< 50; 50-64; > 65), and these age X AUDIT-C interactions have not been evaluated in women. Therefore, the aims of this R03 study are to determine the sex and age-specific risks of onset and hospitalization for gastrointestinal (GI) conditions (i.e., liver disease, upper GI bleeding, pancreatitis), hospitalization for traumatic injury, as well as mortality attributable to AUDIT-C scores using pre-existing data from a national sample of male and female patients from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). As part of the VHA Survey of Health Experiences of Patients (SHEP), the AUDIT-C was completed by a national sample of over 190,000 VHA outpatients in 2004 (over-sampled for women and newly returning veterans; response rate over 71%). In this study, we propose to link these AUDIT-C scores to clinical data in the VHA's National Patient Care Database (2003-2006), Medicare data (2003-2006), and to mortality data. We will estimate the sex and age specific risks for onset and hospitalization for GI conditions, hospitalization for trauma, and mortality attributable to AUDIT-C scores. Logistic regression will be used to model odds of each outcome. Covariates (e.g., smoking, depression, income, race, education, and marital status) will be added to the unadjusted models using the MacArthur Model of risk estimation12, 13. Our long-term goal is to use the risk information produced by this study in three ways: 1) To incorporate the risk information into educational/motivational interventions targeted at both primary care physicians and directly to patients; 2) To produce a web-based guide to aid clinicians in the interpretation of AUDIT-C scores and to provide risk estimates of various outcomes for specific patients; and 3) To seek funding for further validation of the AUDIT-C for purposes other than screening, with the goal of evaluating its potential as an alcohol misuse  vital sign.      The proposed research will calibrate the AUDIT-C so that it can be used by clinicians and clinical researchers as a  vital sign or scaled marker of risk for alcohol-related morbidity and mortality, and to facilitate and motivate improved management of the entire spectrum of alcohol misuse, from drinking above recommended limits to dependence. Sex and age-tailored risk information can persuade clinicians that a patient's alcohol misuse is medically-relevant and provide an evidence-base for conversations with patients about the health- related risks of their alcohol consumption.          n/a",Alcohol Screening Scores and Medical Outcomes:  Age and Gender Influences,7613506,R03AA016793,"['Acute', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohols', 'Arrhythmia', 'Behavior', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Markers', 'Consumption', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Health Surveys', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Income', 'Injury', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver diseases', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marital Status', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pancreatitis', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Preventive', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Screening Result', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Smoking', 'Specialist', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training and Education', 'Trauma', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Woman', 'age group', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol screening', 'alcohol use disorder', 'attributable mortality', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'brief screening', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'clinical practice', 'depression', 'design', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'epidemiologic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal function', 'health administration', 'high risk drinking', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'male', 'men', 'mortality', 'motivational intervention', 'patient population', 'response', 'sex']",NIAAA,PALO ALTO VETERANS INSTIT FOR RESEARCH,R03,2009,70000,14688138,0.15549795553092247
"Dysmorphology Core - U24    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since 1973 when the specific pattern of malformation referred to as the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) was first delineated, it has become clear that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with a broad spectrum of structural anomalies as well as neurobehavioral deficits now referred to as the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). However, the full range of structural anomalies in children prenatally exposed to alcohol is unknown and the incidence of specific anomalies or clusters of anomalies associated with specific patterns of prenatal alcohol consumption are poorly understood. Over the previous three years of the Consortium, the Dysmorphology Core has established a standard comprehensive protocol for physical evaluation of children in order to assure consistency in identification of the broad spectrum of features that constitute FASD at all sites. We propose to continue to support these activities throughout the renewal period in children during the first year of life at Consortium sites in prospective studies in Moscow Region, Russia, and Rivne, Ukraine as well as in older children in retrospective studies in Los Angeles, CA, San Diego, CA, Albuquerque, NM, the Northern Plains states, Atlanta, GA, and Cape Town, South Africa. Identification of large numbers of children at various ages with FAS as well as those with some features of the disorder but not enough to presently qualify them for that diagnosis (FASD), each of whom has received a standardized clinical examination, as well as neurobehavioral evaluation, neuroimaging studies, 3D photographs and, in the prospective studies, prenatal ultrasound studies, will provide the opportunity to address hypotheses regarding the relationship between FASD-related structural defects identified through the standard physical examination with complementary diagnostic methods that are being tested in other Consortium projects. The specific aims of this project are to assure consistency as well as accuracy in recognition of FASD at all CIFASD project sites where children are being evaluated; to delineate the full range of structural anomalies in children prenatally exposed to alcohol in order to determine the boundaries that encompass FASD in prospective as well as retrospective studies involved in the Consortium; to identify specific structural features or clusters of features that are predictive of or correlated with deficits in neurobehavioral development across developmental ages spanning from infancy to adolescence; to correlate the specific structural features or clusters of features identified on the CIFASD standard physical examination with alternative or complementary methods that are being tested in other CIFASD projects; and to better understand the extent to which structural features of FASD are related to specific defects in the development of the brain.          n/a",Dysmorphology Core - U24,7668725,U24AA014815,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choline', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Examination', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Russia', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neuroimaging', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'pediatrician', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2009,162359,524978793,0.23424641543622823

"MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), significant components of which are Central Nervous System (CMS) and craniofacial abnormalities, are a major public health problem. While eliminating FASD is the ultimate goal for both clinical and basic FASD research, we recognize that in the near future, adverse effects from prenatal ethanol exposure will persist. To better diagnose and treat affected individuals, a more complete understanding of the full spectrum of the ethanol-induced abnormalities is needed. The proposed investigations are designed to integrate with those of other consortium members in meeting this need. For this work, both high resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which can provide 29 micron (or less) isotropic scans and subsequent accurate 3-D reconstructions and segmental analyses, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), which allows CMS fiber tract analyses, will be applied to the study of an FASD mouse model. Previous research utilizing this model has established critical exposure times that yield facial and CNS abnormalities that are consistent with full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, as well as other components of FASD. The proposed studies will employ this model and both acute and chronic ethanol treatment paradigms to test the overall hypothesis that in mice, ethanol induces structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are consistent with and informative for those in human FASD. To this end, utilizing MRI and DTI as high throughput screening platforms, we propose to address the following specific aims : 1) to provide comprehensive documentation and discovery of the ethanol-induced CNS dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure at embryonic and early fetal stages of development; 2) to define the facial dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure during embryonic and/or early fetal stages and to relate their character and severity to accompanying abnormalities of the brain; and 3) to identify regions other than the brain or face that may serve as diagnostic indicators of prenatal ethanol exposure. The results of the proposed studies will be compared to those of corresponding investigations by other consortium members. It is expected that the structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are induced by ethanol in mice will reflect the pattern of defects observed in children with FASD, will inform human diagnostic tests, and will provide new information that will be helpful in reducing the incidence of FASD.           n/a",MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01,7668689,U01AA017124,"['3-Dimensional', 'A Mouse', 'Acoustic Nerve', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease model', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fertilization', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetus', 'Fiber', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Hearing Tests', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Labyrinth', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Menstruation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nasal septum structure', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproduction', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'computer generated', 'craniofacial', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'high throughput screening', 'human data', 'human subject', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'interest', 'intraperitoneal', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'meetings', 'member', 'membranous labyrinth', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'sensory system', 'social', 'symposium', 'three dimensional structure', 'web site']",NIAAA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2009,237539,511185245,0.2182498421678354
"Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) occurs in children born to women who drink alcohol heavily during pregnancy and is one of the leading non-hereditary causes of mental retardation in the Western World. It is estimated that the prevalence of FAS in the general U.S. population is between 0.5 and 2.0 per 1,000 births, while the undiagnosed population with variable facial and brain dysmorphology described as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is estimated to be 10 times higher. The difficulty in the diagnosis of FASD involves misdiagnosis due to the presence or absence of the typical facial dysmorphology in association with brain dysfunction. Accurate diagnosis is further complicated by the lack of information about the contribution of dose, frequency, and timing of alcohol exposure during pregnancy to variation in facial dysmorphology. In this project, a mouse model that models human consumption and is known to produce FAS-like features resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure, will be used to test the effects of differences in dose and timing of alcohol exposure on face and brain development. A combination of 3D imaging that includes Micro-video and micro-resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to capture the detailed facial structure, micro-computational tomography (Micro-CT) to capture the underlying facial bone, MRI for detailed brain dimensions, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for nerve fiber tracks in the fetal period. A novel computational program will be compiled to detect features specifically as function of alcohol exposure. The association and dissociation of facial and brain dysmorphology as a function of dose and timing of alcohol exposure will be analyzed to better inform the diagnosis of FAS/ FASD. These studies will be a collaboration sharing resources and methods and will be performed across both Basic and Clinical Science components in consortium effort. To date there is no cure for FAS/FASD, which is a life long ordeal from the birth. Experimental tests, using the above model and setting, of trophic peptides which have been known to prevent neurodegeneration in trials for Alzheimer Disease and protect cell death in embryonic stage, have been partially tested in the embryonic period to show protection against the alcohol-induced retardation. The new studies will test whether the trophic peptides can prevent alcohol-induced brain and facial dysmorphology as well as behavioral impairment known to occur in FAS.          n/a",Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies,7668687,U01AA017123,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Cartilage', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Dissociation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Length', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Retardation', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'NAPVSIPQ peptide', 'Neonatal', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'New Mexico', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeleton', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Vibrissae', 'Western World', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'behavioral impairment', 'bone', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain volume', 'clinical application', 'cognitive control', 'craniofacial', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'digital imaging', 'drinking', 'face bone structure', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'longitudinal design', 'morphometry', 'morris water maze', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotrophic factor', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'peptide analog', 'postnatal', 'pregnant', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory cortex', 'social', 'tomography', 'translational study', 'young adult']",NIAAA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2009,237808,232986943,0.28374300869232894
"Translational Studies of FASD Using a Sheep Model-U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The main goals of this consortium are to identify sources of variation in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) phenotypes (facial dysmorphology, structural brain damage and neurobehavioral functional deficits), to advance understanding of structure-function relationships, to improve diagnosis and early identification of FASD, and to develop early interventions that may limit adverse outcomes in at-risk pregnancies. Animal models are essential to those goals. This project proposes a novel sheep model that is especially well suited for experimental translational studies of FASD. In utero brain development in sheep matches human brain development relatively well, and prenatal binge alcohol exposure in sheep produces brain and behavioral effects consistent with FASD. There are two long-term objectives for this project. The first is to use the sheep model to compare the effects of binge-like alcohol exposure during the period of brain development comparable to that of the human first trimester (1st-trimester mode/) with similar binge-like exposure that extends over the stages of brain development encompassing all three human trimesters (3-trimester model). These studies evaluate phenotypic measures used in the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome-growth, facial dysmorphology, and brain and behavioral development-using methods derived explicitly from and collaboratively linked directly to approaches applied in the human components of the consortium. These studies test the general hypothesis that more pervasive effects on brain and neurobehavioral development will result from binge exposure that continues after the first trimester. Aim 1 will evaluate growth, facial morphometry, and effects on in vivo brain regional volumes using structural magnetic resonance imaging. Aim 2 will assess neurobehavioral outcomes using eyeblink classical conditioning and spatial working memory. Aim 3 will assess neuroanatomical effects via neuronal counts in the cerebellum, hippocampal formation, and brainstem serotonin system. These studies are designed to inter-relate with and reciprocally inform four of the human projects [Facial Imaging (Foroud), Brain Imaging (Sowell), Neurobehavioral project (Mattson), and the Risk Factors/Nutrition project (Chambers)] and the two mouse basic science projects (Zhou; Sulik). The second objective (Aim 4) is to test the hypothesis that choline supplementation initiated periconceptually will attenuate the adverse effects of alcohol exposure in the 3-trimester sheep model. This study was designed with explicit and complementary collaboration with the choline-supplementation projects in rats [the basic science developmental project using rats (Thomas)] and in humans [Risk Factor/Nutrition project of Chambers/Keen]. This sheep model provides a unique opportunity to bridge the basic and clinical   arms of the consortium more closely than has been achieved in the past.           n/a",Translational Studies of FASD Using a Sheep Model-U01,7669196,U01AA017120,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attenuated', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blinking', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar Nuclei', 'Cerebellum', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hippocampal Formation', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microcephaly', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serotonin', 'Severities', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Upper arm', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain volume', 'classical conditioning', 'cognitive control', 'conditioning', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'dentate gyrus', 'design', 'drinking', 'fetal diagnosis', 'follow-up', 'granule cell', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'morphometry', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neuron loss', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'offspring', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'research study', 'social', 'species difference', 'three dimensional structure', 'translational study']",NIAAA,TEXAS A&M AGRILIFE RESEARCH,U01,2009,267924,20014175,0.21641510501366484
"A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"" (Notice RFA-AA-03-004) to continue and expand the current multidisciplinary CIFASD. This RFA calls for, in part, research aimed at ""improved diagnosis"" and ""enhanced understanding of the domains of neurobehavioral impairment"" of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Although 30 years of research have identified myriad deficits in individuals with FASD, most neuropsychological studies are plagued by the question of global dysfunction vs. a pattern of relative sparing and impaired function. Delineation of a neuropsychological profile has been the subject of much recent debate. Limited research, including the current CIFASD consortium, has examined if prenatal alcohol exposure results in general dysfunction or a more specific neurobehavioral profile of strengths and weaknesses. The primary aim of this project is to determine whether a neurobehavioral phenotype exists in children with fetal alcohol syndrome, whether the same phenotype exists in children with FASD who lack facial dysmorphology, and whether the phenotype can be used for differential diagnosis. Secondary aims, involving collaboration with other CIFASD projects and cores, are to determine the relationship between brain dysmorphology, facial dysmorphology, and neurobehavioral function. These aims are in keeping with the overall aims of the CIFASD, including enhanced understanding of the neurobehavioral phenotype and establishment of standardized diagnostic criteria and methods of assessment of FASD. A standard neurobehavioral protocol will be administered to four groups of children at six sites and will address the functional domains of executive function, working memory, verbal function, and psychological symptomatology. In addition to children with FASD and nonexposed controls, children with low IQ scores or ADHD will be included as contrast samples. Using this heterogeneous sample and multivariate statistical methods, neurobehavioral profile specific to FASD will be sought. In addition, participants will be assessed using methodology prescribed by the Dysmorphology Core and the facial and brain imaging projects of the CIFASD. Data from three broad domains (neurobehavior, dysmorphology, and brain morphology and function) will be analyzed both separately and together to address the main aim of the CIFASD: improving the diagnostic criteria for FASD. This project is directly relevant to public health concerns surrounding the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, improving diagnosis of alcohol-affected individuals, and defining the profile of neurobehavioral effects that are specific to FASD. Improved identification and delineation of these features will ultimately lead to improved treatment.           n/a",A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,7853847,U01AA014834,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plague', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'statistics', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2009,305875,35319116,0.2812131297450563
"Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"". One of the overall goals of the entire CIFASD during this renewal period is to determine if innovative techniques can be used to identify brain alterations, neurobehavioral deficits and facial characteristics and relationships between these variables to help define prenatal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To help address this overarching question, we will use quantitative brain mapping techniques with high-resolution structural and functional MRI collected both cross-sectionally and longitudinally from 80 FASD children evaluated across 3 multi-cultural data collection sites (San Diego, Los Angeles and Capetown, South Africa). While this brain imaging project can independently achieve some of the goals of the CIFASD by identifying brain structural and functional abnormalities across the broad spectrum of FASD, critically this funding opportunity will allow the assessment of relationships between the brain, neurocognitive deficits and facial dysmorphology through our active collaborations with the neurobehavioral project (Mattson PI), the facial imaging project (Foroud PI), and the dysmorphology core (Jones PI). Controlled animal studies are essential to determine timing and dosages of prenatal alcohol that result in FASD, but human imaging studies are essential to corroborate anatomical findings across species. Through our association with the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, we have access to state-of-the-art brain mapping tools that allow the morphological evaluation of any brain structure that can be identified with MRI. Thus, we are in a unique position to allow findings in animal studies to drive hypothesis-based analyses in the human imaging data. The proposed longitudinal project will highlight how an integrated approach relating neurobehavioral, functional and structural brain imaging data, and measures of facial morphology might yield important new insights on the complex nature of brain-behavior interactions and how they are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to undertake such challenges, and participation, in the CIFASD is essential to address our specific aims. Ultimately, as part of the CIFASD, this project will enhance the capability for definitive FASD diagnoses that, in turn, will help clinicians manage and treat neurobehavioral deficits and associated secondary disabilities.           n/a","Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)",7668683,U01AA017122,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disorder by Site', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Productivity', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Verbal Learning', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain size', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'disability', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2009,488655,673201228,0.20472897095335862
"Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), first described in the U.S. in 1973 by Jones and Smith, encompasses a pattern of structural abnormalities, growth deficiency, and neurobehavioral impairment that occurs in the offspring of women who consume moderate to heavy amounts of alcohol in pregnancy. FASD is thought to represent the leading known preventable causes of neurobehavioral impairment in the U.S. and perhaps throughout the world. The proposed study offers the opportunity within the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) consortium of projects to describe the spectrum of alcoholrelated effects, to identify risk factors that are antecedent to pregnancy outcome, to test within-pregnancy interventions, and also to test methods that will allow for earlier identification of alcohol-related birth outcomes. Specifically, the proposed research will utilize a prospective cohort study design involving pregnant women and their offspring recruited in Russia and Ukraine to address major gaps in knowledge about FASD by accomplishing the following specific aims: 1) to more fully delineate the complete range of expression of FASD in relation to specific quantities, patterns and gestational timing of alcohol exposure, and to evaluate the sensitivity of methods for earlier recognition of affected children; 2) to assess the contribution of maternal nutritional status in relation to physical and neurobehavioral outcomes associated with prenatal alcohol exposure, and to test the benefit of maternal second and third trimester supplementation with multinutrients with or without choline with respect to risk for FASD in the offspring; and 3) in collaboration with other CIFASD investigators, to provide a well-characterized sample of mothers/children with and without prenatal exposure to alcohol for testing of alternative and earlier methods of identifying affected children, including prenatal ultrasound and post-natal 3D facial imaging. The proposed research has public health relevance from the standpoint of providing an improved estimate of the magnitude and scope of alcoholrelated developmental problems in the context of specific quantities and patterns of prenatal alcohol exposure using standardized methods for assessment, and from the standpoint of developing and validating critically necessary clinical methods for improved and early recognition of affected children and testing the potential benefit of a reasonably applied prenatal intervention that may help ameliorate negative outcomes.          n/a",Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine,7668663,U01AA014835,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional status', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Russia', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'alcohol testing', 'analog', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal intervention', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2009,630076,524978793,0.2759147133359443
"Alcohol Screening Scores and Medical Outcomes:  Age and Gender Influences    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite extensive epidemiological evidence linking alcohol consumption and health, few studies have evaluated whether validated alcohol screening questionnaires employed in clinical practice can be used to assess patients' level of risk for adverse alcohol-related medical outcomes. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test- Consumption (AUDIT-C) is a brief screen for alcohol misuse designed and validated for use in primary care settings1-6. For men, preliminary evidence links AUDIT-C scores to subsequent medical diagnoses that are the consequences of both chronic alcohol use (e.g., liver disease, upper GI bleeding, and pancreatitis) 7, and acute alcohol use (e.g., traumatic injury)8, 9, as well as to mortality10. However, the association between AUDIT-C scores and health problems in women is unknown. Also, research has found that the link between AUDIT-C scores and medical outcomes varies substantially by age10, 11, but the relatively small sample sizes in studies to date have permitted only evaluation of three broad age groups (< 50; 50-64; > 65), and these age X AUDIT-C interactions have not been evaluated in women. Therefore, the aims of this R03 study are to determine the sex and age-specific risks of onset and hospitalization for gastrointestinal (GI) conditions (i.e., liver disease, upper GI bleeding, pancreatitis), hospitalization for traumatic injury, as well as mortality attributable to AUDIT-C scores using pre-existing data from a national sample of male and female patients from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). As part of the VHA Survey of Health Experiences of Patients (SHEP), the AUDIT-C was completed by a national sample of over 190,000 VHA outpatients in 2004 (over-sampled for women and newly returning veterans; response rate over 71%). In this study, we propose to link these AUDIT-C scores to clinical data in the VHA's National Patient Care Database (2003-2006), Medicare data (2003-2006), and to mortality data. We will estimate the sex and age specific risks for onset and hospitalization for GI conditions, hospitalization for trauma, and mortality attributable to AUDIT-C scores. Logistic regression will be used to model odds of each outcome. Covariates (e.g., smoking, depression, income, race, education, and marital status) will be added to the unadjusted models using the MacArthur Model of risk estimation12, 13. Our long-term goal is to use the risk information produced by this study in three ways: 1) To incorporate the risk information into educational/motivational interventions targeted at both primary care physicians and directly to patients; 2) To produce a web-based guide to aid clinicians in the interpretation of AUDIT-C scores and to provide risk estimates of various outcomes for specific patients; and 3) To seek funding for further validation of the AUDIT-C for purposes other than screening, with the goal of evaluating its potential as an alcohol misuse  vital sign.      The proposed research will calibrate the AUDIT-C so that it can be used by clinicians and clinical researchers as a  vital sign or scaled marker of risk for alcohol-related morbidity and mortality, and to facilitate and motivate improved management of the entire spectrum of alcohol misuse, from drinking above recommended limits to dependence. Sex and age-tailored risk information can persuade clinicians that a patient's alcohol misuse is medically-relevant and provide an evidence-base for conversations with patients about the health- related risks of their alcohol consumption.          n/a",Alcohol Screening Scores and Medical Outcomes:  Age and Gender Influences,7387264,R03AA016793,"['Acute', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohols', 'Arrhythmia', 'Behavior', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Markers', 'Condition', 'Consumption', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Health Surveys', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Income', 'Injury', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver diseases', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marital Status', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pancreatitis', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Preventive', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Purpose', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Rate', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Score', 'Screening Result', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Smoking', 'Specialist', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training and Education', 'Trauma', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Woman', 'age group', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol use disorder', 'attributable mortality', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'design', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal function', 'health administration', 'high risk drinking', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'male', 'men', 'mortality', 'motivational intervention', 'response', 'sex', 'size']",NIAAA,PALO ALTO VETERANS INSTIT FOR RESEARCH,R03,2008,70000,14688138,0.15549795553092247
"3D Facial Imaging in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During the past three years, members of the Facial Imaging Core have worked with the Consortium to apply novel methods to more effectively diagnose FAS using 3D images from an ethnically diverse sample. These data and their subsequent analyses were used to identify features which consistently and reliably distinguished individuals with a clinical diagnosis of FAS from controls. Based on the initial success of the 'Facial Imaging Core', we now propose an expanded series of aims to be part of a clinical project named '3D Facial Imaging in FASD'. Subsequent work proposed in this study will build on the lessons learned in this first phase of research and utilize improved technology and sampling procedures to extend the diagnostic utility of these novel techniques to a wider range of individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure or FASD. In collaboration with several clinical projects, we will collect a longitudinal, multi-ethnic sample of individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol. This sample will allow us to reliably separate the effects of ethnic variation and developmental age from those due to alcohol exposure. We will also continue to work with the basic science projects to ensure that results in the different species (human, mouse, sheep) are used to inform analyses in each project. The overarching goals of this project are to: Goal 1: improve understanding of the dysmorphic features in FAS and FASD; Goal 2: enhance the capability for definitive diagnosis of FAS and the broader spectrum of FASD at different stages of the lifespan; and Goal 3: establish whether there is a relationship between FAS and FASD dysmorphic features and the specific underlying impairments in brain function.           n/a",3D Facial Imaging in FASD (U01),7678304,U01AA014809,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Range', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Translating', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'craniofacial', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'disorder control', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'success', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2008,153230,232986943,0.22306742279972316
"Dysmorphology Core - U24    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since 1973 when the specific pattern of malformation referred to as the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) was first delineated, it has become clear that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with a broad spectrum of structural anomalies as well as neurobehavioral deficits now referred to as the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). However, the full range of structural anomalies in children prenatally exposed to alcohol is unknown and the incidence of specific anomalies or clusters of anomalies associated with specific patterns of prenatal alcohol consumption are poorly understood. Over the previous three years of the Consortium, the Dysmorphology Core has established a standard comprehensive protocol for physical evaluation of children in order to assure consistency in identification of the broad spectrum of features that constitute FASD at all sites. We propose to continue to support these activities throughout the renewal period in children during the first year of life at Consortium sites in prospective studies in Moscow Region, Russia, and Rivne, Ukraine as well as in older children in retrospective studies in Los Angeles, CA, San Diego, CA, Albuquerque, NM, the Northern Plains states, Atlanta, GA, and Cape Town, South Africa. Identification of large numbers of children at various ages with FAS as well as those with some features of the disorder but not enough to presently qualify them for that diagnosis (FASD), each of whom has received a standardized clinical examination, as well as neurobehavioral evaluation, neuroimaging studies, 3D photographs and, in the prospective studies, prenatal ultrasound studies, will provide the opportunity to address hypotheses regarding the relationship between FASD-related structural defects identified through the standard physical examination with complementary diagnostic methods that are being tested in other Consortium projects. The specific aims of this project are to assure consistency as well as accuracy in recognition of FASD at all CIFASD project sites where children are being evaluated; to delineate the full range of structural anomalies in children prenatally exposed to alcohol in order to determine the boundaries that encompass FASD in prospective as well as retrospective studies involved in the Consortium; to identify specific structural features or clusters of features that are predictive of or correlated with deficits in neurobehavioral development across developmental ages spanning from infancy to adolescence; to correlate the specific structural features or clusters of features identified on the CIFASD standard physical examination with alternative or complementary methods that are being tested in other CIFASD projects; and to better understand the extent to which structural features of FASD are related to specific defects in the development of the brain.          n/a",Dysmorphology Core - U24,7502755,U24AA014815,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'All Sites', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choline', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Examination', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Range', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Russia', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neuroimaging', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'prenatal', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2008,159503,524978793,0.23424641543622823
"Informatics Core for the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum disor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Informatics Core is part of the Consortium for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders"" (CIFASD). The theme of this collaborative initiative is a cross-cultural assessment of ""fetal alcohol spectrum disorder"" (FASD). The CIFASD will coordinate basic, behavioral, and clinical investigators in a multidisciplinary research project to better inform approaches aimed at developing effective intervention and treatment approaches for FASD. It will involve the input and contributions from basic researchers, behavioral scientists, and clinical investigators with the willingness to utilize novel and cutting-edge techniques so as not to simply replicate previous or ongoing work, but rather to try and move it forward in a rigorous fashion. The Informatics Core will develop and maintain the CIFASD Data Repository, which will be used to collect, maintain and distribute data generated by the various participants in the consortium. The Informatics Core will be responsible for working with the other consortium participants to define a Data Dictionary to be used in standardizing data collection, enabling the transfer of data to and from the CIFASD Data Repository, consulting on how to establish local data management systems, providing both software tools and consulting to consortium participants, and producing status reports about the progress of the various projects within the consortium. The Informatics Core draws on a wealth of resources, experience, and expertise at Indiana University in information technology infrastructure and data management, The CIFASD Data Repository will be developed on Indiana University's state-of-the-art central supercomputing facilities, taking advantage of Indiana University's strong commitment to institutional computational resources. Resources that will be used to implement the CIFASD Data Repository include multiple supercomputers, an array of readily available database and statistical software, and a high- speed, secure, robust data archiving system capable of storing duplicate copies in multiple physical locations separated by more than fifty miles.

"MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), significant components of which are Central Nervous System (CMS) and craniofacial abnormalities, are a major public health problem. While eliminating FASD is the ultimate goal for both clinical and basic FASD research, we recognize that in the near future, adverse effects from prenatal ethanol exposure will persist. To better diagnose and treat affected individuals, a more complete understanding of the full spectrum of the ethanol-induced abnormalities is needed. The proposed investigations are designed to integrate with those of other consortium members in meeting this need. For this work, both high resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which can provide 29 micron (or less) isotropic scans and subsequent accurate 3-D reconstructions and segmental analyses, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), which allows CMS fiber tract analyses, will be applied to the study of an FASD mouse model. Previous research utilizing this model has established critical exposure times that yield facial and CNS abnormalities that are consistent with full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, as well as other components of FASD. The proposed studies will employ this model and both acute and chronic ethanol treatment paradigms to test the overall hypothesis that in mice, ethanol induces structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are consistent with and informative for those in human FASD. To this end, utilizing MRI and DTI as high throughput screening platforms, we propose to address the following specific aims : 1) to provide comprehensive documentation and discovery of the ethanol-induced CNS dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure at embryonic and early fetal stages of development; 2) to define the facial dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure during embryonic and/or early fetal stages and to relate their character and severity to accompanying abnormalities of the brain; and 3) to identify regions other than the brain or face that may serve as diagnostic indicators of prenatal ethanol exposure. The results of the proposed studies will be compared to those of corresponding investigations by other consortium members. It is expected that the structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are induced by ethanol in mice will reflect the pattern of defects observed in children with FASD, will inform human diagnostic tests, and will provide new information that will be helpful in reducing the incidence of FASD.           n/a",MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01,7502729,U01AA017124,"['3-Dimensional', 'A Mouse', 'Acoustic Nerve', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease model', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Emotional', 'End Point', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fertilization', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetus', 'Fiber', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Hearing Tests', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Labyrinth', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Menstruation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nasal septum structure', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproduction', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Week', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'computer generated', 'craniofacial', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'day', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'high throughput screening', 'human data', 'human study', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'interest', 'intraperitoneal', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'member', 'membranous labyrinth', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'sensory system', 'size', 'social', 'symposium', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2008,234161,511185245,0.2182498421678354
"Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) occurs in children born to women who drink alcohol heavily during pregnancy and is one of the leading non-hereditary causes of mental retardation in the Western World. It is estimated that the prevalence of FAS in the general U.S. population is between 0.5 and 2.0 per 1,000 births, while the undiagnosed population with variable facial and brain dysmorphology described as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is estimated to be 10 times higher. The difficulty in the diagnosis of FASD involves misdiagnosis due to the presence or absence of the typical facial dysmorphology in association with brain dysfunction. Accurate diagnosis is further complicated by the lack of information about the contribution of dose, frequency, and timing of alcohol exposure during pregnancy to variation in facial dysmorphology. In this project, a mouse model that models human consumption and is known to produce FAS-like features resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure, will be used to test the effects of differences in dose and timing of alcohol exposure on face and brain development. A combination of 3D imaging that includes Micro-video and micro-resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to capture the detailed facial structure, micro-computational tomography (Micro-CT) to capture the underlying facial bone, MRI for detailed brain dimensions, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for nerve fiber tracks in the fetal period. A novel computational program will be compiled to detect features specifically as function of alcohol exposure. The association and dissociation of facial and brain dysmorphology as a function of dose and timing of alcohol exposure will be analyzed to better inform the diagnosis of FAS/ FASD. These studies will be a collaboration sharing resources and methods and will be performed across both Basic and Clinical Science components in consortium effort. To date there is no cure for FAS/FASD, which is a life long ordeal from the birth. Experimental tests, using the above model and setting, of trophic peptides which have been known to prevent neurodegeneration in trials for Alzheimer Disease and protect cell death in embryonic stage, have been partially tested in the embryonic period to show protection against the alcohol-induced retardation. The new studies will test whether the trophic peptides can prevent alcohol-induced brain and facial dysmorphology as well as behavioral impairment known to occur in FAS.          n/a",Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies,7502713,U01AA017123,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Bone and Cartilage Funding', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'CDKN1A gene', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Consumption', 'Count', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disruption', 'Dissociation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Length', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Retardation', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'NAPVSIPQ peptide', 'Neonatal', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'New Mexico', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient currently pregnant', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeleton', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Vibrissae', 'Western World', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain volume', 'clinical application', 'cognitive control', 'craniofacial', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'day', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'drinking', 'face bone structure', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'human study', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'morphometry', 'morris water maze', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotrophic factor', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'oncoprotein p21', 'peptide analog', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory cortex', 'social', 'tomography', 'translational study', 'young adult']",NIAAA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2008,235382,232986943,0.28374300869232894
"Translational Studies of FASD Using a Sheep Model-U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The main goals of this consortium are to identify sources of variation in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) phenotypes (facial dysmorphology, structural brain damage and neurobehavioral functional deficits), to advance understanding of structure-function relationships, to improve diagnosis and early identification of FASD, and to develop early interventions that may limit adverse outcomes in at-risk pregnancies. Animal models are essential to those goals. This project proposes a novel sheep model that is especially well suited for experimental translational studies of FASD. In utero brain development in sheep matches human brain development relatively well, and prenatal binge alcohol exposure in sheep produces brain and behavioral effects consistent with FASD. There are two long-term objectives for this project. The first is to use the sheep model to compare the effects of binge-like alcohol exposure during the period of brain development comparable to that of the human first trimester (1st-trimester mode/) with similar binge-like exposure that extends over the stages of brain development encompassing all three human trimesters (3-trimester model). These studies evaluate phenotypic measures used in the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome-growth, facial dysmorphology, and brain and behavioral development-using methods derived explicitly from and collaboratively linked directly to approaches applied in the human components of the consortium. These studies test the general hypothesis that more pervasive effects on brain and neurobehavioral development will result from binge exposure that continues after the first trimester. Aim 1 will evaluate growth, facial morphometry, and effects on in vivo brain regional volumes using structural magnetic resonance imaging. Aim 2 will assess neurobehavioral outcomes using eyeblink classical conditioning and spatial working memory. Aim 3 will assess neuroanatomical effects via neuronal counts in the cerebellum, hippocampal formation, and brainstem serotonin system. These studies are designed to inter-relate with and reciprocally inform four of the human projects [Facial Imaging (Foroud), Brain Imaging (Sowell), Neurobehavioral project (Mattson), and the Risk Factors/Nutrition project (Chambers)] and the two mouse basic science projects (Zhou; Sulik). The second objective (Aim 4) is to test the hypothesis that choline supplementation initiated periconceptually will attenuate the adverse effects of alcohol exposure in the 3-trimester sheep model. This study was designed with explicit and complementary collaboration with the choline-supplementation projects in rats [the basic science developmental project using rats (Thomas)] and in humans [Risk Factor/Nutrition project of Chambers/Keen]. This sheep model provides a unique opportunity to bridge the basic and clinical   arms of the consortium more closely than has been achieved in the past.           n/a",Translational Studies of FASD Using a Sheep Model-U01,7503981,U01AA017120,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attenuated', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blinking', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar Nuclei', 'Cerebellum', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Condition', 'Count', 'Data', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hippocampal Formation', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microcephaly', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'New Mexico', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serotonin', 'Severities', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Upper arm', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain volume', 'classical conditioning', 'cognitive control', 'conditioning', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'dentate gyrus', 'design', 'drinking', 'fetal diagnosis', 'follow-up', 'granule cell', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'morphometry', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neuron loss', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'social', 'species difference', 'three dimensional structure', 'translational study']",NIAAA,TEXAS A&M AGRILIFE RESEARCH,U01,2008,260772,20014175,0.21641510501366484
"3D Facial Imaging in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During the past three years, members of the Facial Imaging Core have worked with the Consortium to apply novel methods to more effectively diagnose FAS using 3D images from an ethnically diverse sample. These data and their subsequent analyses were used to identify features which consistently and reliably distinguished individuals with a clinical diagnosis of FAS from controls. Based on the initial success of the 'Facial Imaging Core', we now propose an expanded series of aims to be part of a clinical project named '3D Facial Imaging in FASD'. Subsequent work proposed in this study will build on the lessons learned in this first phase of research and utilize improved technology and sampling procedures to extend the diagnostic utility of these novel techniques to a wider range of individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure or FASD. In collaboration with several clinical projects, we will collect a longitudinal, multi-ethnic sample of individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol. This sample will allow us to reliably separate the effects of ethnic variation and developmental age from those due to alcohol exposure. We will also continue to work with the basic science projects to ensure that results in the different species (human, mouse, sheep) are used to inform analyses in each project. The overarching goals of this project are to: Goal 1: improve understanding of the dysmorphic features in FAS and FASD; Goal 2: enhance the capability for definitive diagnosis of FAS and the broader spectrum of FASD at different stages of the lifespan; and Goal 3: establish whether there is a relationship between FAS and FASD dysmorphic features and the specific underlying impairments in brain function.           n/a",3D Facial Imaging in FASD (U01),7502720,U01AA014809,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Range', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Translating', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'craniofacial', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'disorder control', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'success', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2008,341942,232986943,0.22306742279972316
"Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"". One of the overall goals of the entire CIFASD during this renewal period is to determine if innovative techniques can be used to identify brain alterations, neurobehavioral deficits and facial characteristics and relationships between these variables to help define prenatal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To help address this overarching question, we will use quantitative brain mapping techniques with high-resolution structural and functional MRI collected both cross-sectionally and longitudinally from 80 FASD children evaluated across 3 multi-cultural data collection sites (San Diego, Los Angeles and Capetown, South Africa). While this brain imaging project can independently achieve some of the goals of the CIFASD by identifying brain structural and functional abnormalities across the broad spectrum of FASD, critically this funding opportunity will allow the assessment of relationships between the brain, neurocognitive deficits and facial dysmorphology through our active collaborations with the neurobehavioral project (Mattson PI), the facial imaging project (Foroud PI), and the dysmorphology core (Jones PI). Controlled animal studies are essential to determine timing and dosages of prenatal alcohol that result in FASD, but human imaging studies are essential to corroborate anatomical findings across species. Through our association with the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, we have access to state-of-the-art brain mapping tools that allow the morphological evaluation of any brain structure that can be identified with MRI. Thus, we are in a unique position to allow findings in animal studies to drive hypothesis-based analyses in the human imaging data. The proposed longitudinal project will highlight how an integrated approach relating neurobehavioral, functional and structural brain imaging data, and measures of facial morphology might yield important new insights on the complex nature of brain-behavior interactions and how they are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to undertake such challenges, and participation, in the CIFASD is essential to address our specific aims. Ultimately, as part of the CIFASD, this project will enhance the capability for definitive FASD diagnoses that, in turn, will help clinicians manage and treat neurobehavioral deficits and associated secondary disabilities.           n/a","Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)",7502725,U01AA017122,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disorder by Site', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Productivity', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Score', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Verbal Learning', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain size', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'disability', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'human study', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2008,474412,673201228,0.20472897095335862
"A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"" (Notice RFA-AA-03-004) to continue and expand the current multidisciplinary CIFASD. This RFA calls for, in part, research aimed at ""improved diagnosis"" and ""enhanced understanding of the domains of neurobehavioral impairment"" of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Although 30 years of research have identified myriad deficits in individuals with FASD, most neuropsychological studies are plagued by the question of global dysfunction vs. a pattern of relative sparing and impaired function. Delineation of a neuropsychological profile has been the subject of much recent debate. Limited research, including the current CIFASD consortium, has examined if prenatal alcohol exposure results in general dysfunction or a more specific neurobehavioral profile of strengths and weaknesses. The primary aim of this project is to determine whether a neurobehavioral phenotype exists in children with fetal alcohol syndrome, whether the same phenotype exists in children with FASD who lack facial dysmorphology, and whether the phenotype can be used for differential diagnosis. Secondary aims, involving collaboration with other CIFASD projects and cores, are to determine the relationship between brain dysmorphology, facial dysmorphology, and neurobehavioral function. These aims are in keeping with the overall aims of the CIFASD, including enhanced understanding of the neurobehavioral phenotype and establishment of standardized diagnostic criteria and methods of assessment of FASD. A standard neurobehavioral protocol will be administered to four groups of children at six sites and will address the functional domains of executive function, working memory, verbal function, and psychological symptomatology. In addition to children with FASD and nonexposed controls, children with low IQ scores or ADHD will be included as contrast samples. Using this heterogeneous sample and multivariate statistical methods, neurobehavioral profile specific to FASD will be sought. In addition, participants will be assessed using methodology prescribed by the Dysmorphology Core and the facial and brain imaging projects of the CIFASD. Data from three broad domains (neurobehavior, dysmorphology, and brain morphology and function) will be analyzed both separately and together to address the main aim of the CIFASD: improving the diagnostic criteria for FASD. This project is directly relevant to public health concerns surrounding the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, improving diagnosis of alcohol-affected individuals, and defining the profile of neurobehavioral effects that are specific to FASD. Improved identification and delineation of these features will ultimately lead to improved treatment.           n/a",A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,7502760,U01AA014834,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plague', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Score', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'statistics', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2008,651718,35319116,0.2812131297450563
"Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), first described in the U.S. in 1973 by Jones and Smith, encompasses a pattern of structural abnormalities, growth deficiency, and neurobehavioral impairment that occurs in the offspring of women who consume moderate to heavy amounts of alcohol in pregnancy. FASD is thought to represent the leading known preventable causes of neurobehavioral impairment in the U.S. and perhaps throughout the world. The proposed study offers the opportunity within the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) consortium of projects to describe the spectrum of alcoholrelated effects, to identify risk factors that are antecedent to pregnancy outcome, to test within-pregnancy interventions, and also to test methods that will allow for earlier identification of alcohol-related birth outcomes. Specifically, the proposed research will utilize a prospective cohort study design involving pregnant women and their offspring recruited in Russia and Ukraine to address major gaps in knowledge about FASD by accomplishing the following specific aims: 1) to more fully delineate the complete range of expression of FASD in relation to specific quantities, patterns and gestational timing of alcohol exposure, and to evaluate the sensitivity of methods for earlier recognition of affected children; 2) to assess the contribution of maternal nutritional status in relation to physical and neurobehavioral outcomes associated with prenatal alcohol exposure, and to test the benefit of maternal second and third trimester supplementation with multinutrients with or without choline with respect to risk for FASD in the offspring; and 3) in collaboration with other CIFASD investigators, to provide a well-characterized sample of mothers/children with and without prenatal exposure to alcohol for testing of alternative and earlier methods of identifying affected children, including prenatal ultrasound and post-natal 3D facial imaging. The proposed research has public health relevance from the standpoint of providing an improved estimate of the magnitude and scope of alcoholrelated developmental problems in the context of specific quantities and patterns of prenatal alcohol exposure using standardized methods for assessment, and from the standpoint of developing and validating critically necessary clinical methods for improved and early recognition of affected children and testing the potential benefit of a reasonably applied prenatal intervention that may help ameliorate negative outcomes.          n/a",Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine,7502741,U01AA014835,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age-Months', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Coordination and Collaboration', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetus', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gender Role', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Micronutrients', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'New Mexico', 'Numbers', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional status', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Patient currently pregnant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy Trimesters', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Russia', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Sudden infant death syndrome', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Translational Research', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Weight Gain', 'Woman', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'absorption', 'alcohol consumption during pregnancy', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'alcohol testing', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'cohort', 'compare effectiveness', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'performance site', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal intervention', 'processing speed', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'skills', 'social', 'stillbirth', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2008,690277,524978793,0.2759147133359443
"Dysmorphology Core - U24    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since 1973 when the specific pattern of malformation referred to as the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) was first delineated, it has become clear that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with a broad spectrum of structural anomalies as well as neurobehavioral deficits now referred to as the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). However, the full range of structural anomalies in children prenatally exposed to alcohol is unknown and the incidence of specific anomalies or clusters of anomalies associated with specific patterns of prenatal alcohol consumption are poorly understood. Over the previous three years of the Consortium, the Dysmorphology Core has established a standard comprehensive protocol for physical evaluation of children in order to assure consistency in identification of the broad spectrum of features that constitute FASD at all sites. We propose to continue to support these activities throughout the renewal period in children during the first year of life at Consortium sites in prospective studies in Moscow Region, Russia, and Rivne, Ukraine as well as in older children in retrospective studies in Los Angeles, CA, San Diego, CA, Albuquerque, NM, the Northern Plains states, Atlanta, GA, and Cape Town, South Africa. Identification of large numbers of children at various ages with FAS as well as those with some features of the disorder but not enough to presently qualify them for that diagnosis (FASD), each of whom has received a standardized clinical examination, as well as neurobehavioral evaluation, neuroimaging studies, 3D photographs and, in the prospective studies, prenatal ultrasound studies, will provide the opportunity to address hypotheses regarding the relationship between FASD-related structural defects identified through the standard physical examination with complementary diagnostic methods that are being tested in other Consortium projects. The specific aims of this project are to assure consistency as well as accuracy in recognition of FASD at all CIFASD project sites where children are being evaluated; to delineate the full range of structural anomalies in children prenatally exposed to alcohol in order to determine the boundaries that encompass FASD in prospective as well as retrospective studies involved in the Consortium; to identify specific structural features or clusters of features that are predictive of or correlated with deficits in neurobehavioral development across developmental ages spanning from infancy to adolescence; to correlate the specific structural features or clusters of features identified on the CIFASD standard physical examination with alternative or complementary methods that are being tested in other CIFASD projects; and to better understand the extent to which structural features of FASD are related to specific defects in the development of the brain.          n/a",Dysmorphology Core - U24,7345662,U24AA014815,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'All Sites', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choline', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Examination', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Range', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Russia', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neuroimaging', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'prenatal', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,U24,2007,153891,0,0.23424641543622823
"Informatics Core for the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum disor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Informatics Core is part of the Consortium for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders"" (CIFASD). The theme of this collaborative initiative is a cross-cultural assessment of ""fetal alcohol spectrum disorder"" (FASD).

"Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) occurs in children born to women who drink alcohol heavily during pregnancy and is one of the leading non-hereditary causes of mental retardation in the Western World. It is estimated that the prevalence of FAS in the general U.S. population is between 0.5 and 2.0 per 1,000 births, while the undiagnosed population with variable facial and brain dysmorphology described as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is estimated to be 10 times higher. The difficulty in the diagnosis of FASD involves misdiagnosis due to the presence or absence of the typical facial dysmorphology in association with brain dysfunction. Accurate diagnosis is further complicated by the lack of information about the contribution of dose, frequency, and timing of alcohol exposure during pregnancy to variation in facial dysmorphology. In this project, a mouse model that models human consumption and is known to produce FAS-like features resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure, will be used to test the effects of differences in dose and timing of alcohol exposure on face and brain development. A combination of 3D imaging that includes Micro-video and micro-resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to capture the detailed facial structure, micro-computational tomography (Micro-CT) to capture the underlying facial bone, MRI for detailed brain dimensions, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for nerve fiber tracks in the fetal period. A novel computational program will be compiled to detect features specifically as function of alcohol exposure. The association and dissociation of facial and brain dysmorphology as a function of dose and timing of alcohol exposure will be analyzed to better inform the diagnosis of FAS/ FASD. These studies will be a collaboration sharing resources and methods and will be performed across both Basic and Clinical Science components in consortium effort. To date there is no cure for FAS/FASD, which is a life long ordeal from the birth. Experimental tests, using the above model and setting, of trophic peptides which have been known to prevent neurodegeneration in trials for Alzheimer Disease and protect cell death in embryonic stage, have been partially tested in the embryonic period to show protection against the alcohol-induced retardation. The new studies will test whether the trophic peptides can prevent alcohol-induced brain and facial dysmorphology as well as behavioral impairment known to occur in FAS.          n/a",Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies,7343333,U01AA017123,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Bone and Cartilage Funding', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'CDKN1A gene', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Consumption', 'Count', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disruption', 'Dissociation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Length', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Retardation', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'NAPVSIPQ peptide', 'Neonatal', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'New Mexico', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient currently pregnant', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeleton', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Vibrissae', 'Western World', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain volume', 'clinical application', 'cognitive control', 'craniofacial', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'day', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'drinking', 'face bone structure', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'human study', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'morphometry', 'morris water maze', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotrophic factor', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'oncoprotein p21', 'peptide analog', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory cortex', 'social', 'tomography', 'translational study', 'young adult']",NIAAA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2007,224838,232986943,0.28374300869232894
"MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), significant components of which are Central Nervous System (CMS) and craniofacial abnormalities, are a major public health problem. While eliminating FASD is the ultimate goal for both clinical and basic FASD research, we recognize that in the near future, adverse effects from prenatal ethanol exposure will persist. To better diagnose and treat affected individuals, a more complete understanding of the full spectrum of the ethanol-induced abnormalities is needed. The proposed investigations are designed to integrate with those of other consortium members in meeting this need. For this work, both high resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which can provide 29 micron (or less) isotropic scans and subsequent accurate 3-D reconstructions and segmental analyses, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), which allows CMS fiber tract analyses, will be applied to the study of an FASD mouse model. Previous research utilizing this model has established critical exposure times that yield facial and CNS abnormalities that are consistent with full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, as well as other components of FASD. The proposed studies will employ this model and both acute and chronic ethanol treatment paradigms to test the overall hypothesis that in mice, ethanol induces structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are consistent with and informative for those in human FASD. To this end, utilizing MRI and DTI as high throughput screening platforms, we propose to address the following specific aims : 1) to provide comprehensive documentation and discovery of the ethanol-induced CNS dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure at embryonic and early fetal stages of development; 2) to define the facial dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure during embryonic and/or early fetal stages and to relate their character and severity to accompanying abnormalities of the brain; and 3) to identify regions other than the brain or face that may serve as diagnostic indicators of prenatal ethanol exposure. The results of the proposed studies will be compared to those of corresponding investigations by other consortium members. It is expected that the structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are induced by ethanol in mice will reflect the pattern of defects observed in children with FASD, will inform human diagnostic tests, and will provide new information that will be helpful in reducing the incidence of FASD.           n/a",MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01,7343348,U01AA017124,"['3-Dimensional', 'A Mouse', 'Acoustic Nerve', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease model', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Emotional', 'End Point', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fertilization', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetus', 'Fiber', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Hearing Tests', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Labyrinth', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Menstruation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nasal septum structure', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproduction', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Week', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'computer generated', 'craniofacial', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'day', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'high throughput screening', 'human data', 'human study', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'interest', 'intraperitoneal', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'member', 'membranous labyrinth', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'sensory system', 'size', 'social', 'symposium', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2007,225000,511185245,0.2182498421678354
"Translational Studies of FASD Using a Sheep Model-U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The main goals of this consortium are to identify sources of variation in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) phenotypes (facial dysmorphology, structural brain damage and neurobehavioral functional deficits), to advance understanding of structure-function relationships, to improve diagnosis and early identification of FASD, and to develop early interventions that may limit adverse outcomes in at-risk pregnancies. Animal models are essential to those goals. This project proposes a novel sheep model that is especially well suited for experimental translational studies of FASD. In utero brain development in sheep matches human brain development relatively well, and prenatal binge alcohol exposure in sheep produces brain and behavioral effects consistent with FASD. There are two long-term objectives for this project. The first is to use the sheep model to compare the effects of binge-like alcohol exposure during the period of brain development comparable to that of the human first trimester (1st-trimester mode/) with similar binge-like exposure that extends over the stages of brain development encompassing all three human trimesters (3-trimester model). These studies evaluate phenotypic measures used in the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome-growth, facial dysmorphology, and brain and behavioral development-using methods derived explicitly from and collaboratively linked directly to approaches applied in the human components of the consortium. These studies test the general hypothesis that more pervasive effects on brain and neurobehavioral development will result from binge exposure that continues after the first trimester. Aim 1 will evaluate growth, facial morphometry, and effects on in vivo brain regional volumes using structural magnetic resonance imaging. Aim 2 will assess neurobehavioral outcomes using eyeblink classical conditioning and spatial working memory. Aim 3 will assess neuroanatomical effects via neuronal counts in the cerebellum, hippocampal formation, and brainstem serotonin system. These studies are designed to inter-relate with and reciprocally inform four of the human projects [Facial Imaging (Foroud), Brain Imaging (Sowell), Neurobehavioral project (Mattson), and the Risk Factors/Nutrition project (Chambers)] and the two mouse basic science projects (Zhou; Sulik). The second objective (Aim 4) is to test the hypothesis that choline supplementation initiated periconceptually will attenuate the adverse effects of alcohol exposure in the 3-trimester sheep model.

"3D Facial Imaging in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During the past three years, members of the Facial Imaging Core have worked with the Consortium to apply novel methods to more effectively diagnose FAS using 3D images from an ethnically diverse sample. These data and their subsequent analyses were used to identify features which consistently and reliably distinguished individuals with a clinical diagnosis of FAS from controls. Based on the initial success of the 'Facial Imaging Core', we now propose an expanded series of aims to be part of a clinical project named '3D Facial Imaging in FASD'. Subsequent work proposed in this study will build on the lessons learned in this first phase of research and utilize improved technology and sampling procedures to extend the diagnostic utility of these novel techniques to a wider range of individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure or FASD. In collaboration with several clinical projects, we will collect a longitudinal, multi-ethnic sample of individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol. This sample will allow us to reliably separate the effects of ethnic variation and developmental age from those due to alcohol exposure. We will also continue to work with the basic science projects to ensure that results in the different species (human, mouse, sheep) are used to inform analyses in each project. The overarching goals of this project are to: Goal 1: improve understanding of the dysmorphic features in FAS and FASD; Goal 2: enhance the capability for definitive diagnosis of FAS and the broader spectrum of FASD at different stages of the lifespan; and Goal 3: establish whether there is a relationship between FAS and FASD dysmorphic features and the specific underlying impairments in brain function.           n/a",3D Facial Imaging in FASD (U01),7342564,U01AA014809,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Range', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Translating', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'craniofacial', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'disorder control', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'success', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2007,359361,232986943,0.22306742279972316
"Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"". One of the overall goals of the entire CIFASD during this renewal period is to determine if innovative techniques can be used to identify brain alterations, neurobehavioral deficits and facial characteristics and relationships between these variables to help define prenatal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To help address this overarching question, we will use quantitative brain mapping techniques with high-resolution structural and functional MRI collected both cross-sectionally and longitudinally from 80 FASD children evaluated across 3 multi-cultural data collection sites (San Diego, Los Angeles and Capetown, South Africa). While this brain imaging project can independently achieve some of the goals of the CIFASD by identifying brain structural and functional abnormalities across the broad spectrum of FASD, critically this funding opportunity will allow the assessment of relationships between the brain, neurocognitive deficits and facial dysmorphology through our active collaborations with the neurobehavioral project (Mattson PI), the facial imaging project (Foroud PI), and the dysmorphology core (Jones PI). Controlled animal studies are essential to determine timing and dosages of prenatal alcohol that result in FASD, but human imaging studies are essential to corroborate anatomical findings across species. Through our association with the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, we have access to state-of-the-art brain mapping tools that allow the morphological evaluation of any brain structure that can be identified with MRI. Thus, we are in a unique position to allow findings in animal studies to drive hypothesis-based analyses in the human imaging data. The proposed longitudinal project will highlight how an integrated approach relating neurobehavioral, functional and structural brain imaging data, and measures of facial morphology might yield important new insights on the complex nature of brain-behavior interactions and how they are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to undertake such challenges, and participation, in the CIFASD is essential to address our specific aims. Ultimately, as part of the CIFASD, this project will enhance the capability for definitive FASD diagnoses that, in turn, will help clinicians manage and treat neurobehavioral deficits and associated secondary disabilities.           n/a","Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)",7343320,U01AA017122,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disorder by Site', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Productivity', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Score', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Verbal Learning', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain size', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'disability', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'human study', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2007,496998,673201228,0.20472897095335862
"Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), first described in the U.S. in 1973 by Jones and Smith, encompasses a pattern of structural abnormalities, growth deficiency, and neurobehavioral impairment that occurs in the offspring of women who consume moderate to heavy amounts of alcohol in pregnancy. FASD is thought to represent the leading known preventable causes of neurobehavioral impairment in the U.S. and perhaps throughout the world. The proposed study offers the opportunity within the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) consortium of projects to describe the spectrum of alcoholrelated effects, to identify risk factors that are antecedent to pregnancy outcome, to test within-pregnancy interventions, and also to test methods that will allow for earlier identification of alcohol-related birth outcomes. Specifically, the proposed research will utilize a prospective cohort study design involving pregnant women and their offspring recruited in Russia and Ukraine to address major gaps in knowledge about FASD by accomplishing the following specific aims: 1) to more fully delineate the complete range of expression of FASD in relation to specific quantities, patterns and gestational timing of alcohol exposure, and to evaluate the sensitivity of methods for earlier recognition of affected children; 2) to assess the contribution of maternal nutritional status in relation to physical and neurobehavioral outcomes associated with prenatal alcohol exposure, and to test the benefit of maternal second and third trimester supplementation with multinutrients with or without choline with respect to risk for FASD in the offspring; and 3) in collaboration with other CIFASD investigators, to provide a well-characterized sample of mothers/children with and without prenatal exposure to alcohol for testing of alternative and earlier methods of identifying affected children, including prenatal ultrasound and post-natal 3D facial imaging. The proposed research has public health relevance from the standpoint of providing an improved estimate of the magnitude and scope of alcoholrelated developmental problems in the context of specific quantities and patterns of prenatal alcohol exposure using standardized methods for assessment, and from the standpoint of developing and validating critically necessary clinical methods for improved and early recognition of affected children and testing the potential benefit of a reasonably applied prenatal intervention that may help ameliorate negative outcomes.          n/a",Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine,7343353,U01AA014835,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age-Months', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Coordination and Collaboration', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetus', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gender Role', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Micronutrients', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'New Mexico', 'Numbers', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional status', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Patient currently pregnant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy Trimesters', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Russia', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Sudden infant death syndrome', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Translational Research', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Weight Gain', 'Woman', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'absorption', 'alcohol consumption during pregnancy', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'alcohol testing', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'cohort', 'compare effectiveness', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'performance site', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal intervention', 'processing speed', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'skills', 'social', 'stillbirth', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,U01,2007,656344,0,0.2759147133359443
"A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"" (Notice RFA-AA-03-004) to continue and expand the current multidisciplinary CIFASD. This RFA calls for, in part, research aimed at ""improved diagnosis"" and ""enhanced understanding of the domains of neurobehavioral impairment"" of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Although 30 years of research have identified myriad deficits in individuals with FASD, most neuropsychological studies are plagued by the question of global dysfunction vs. a pattern of relative sparing and impaired function. Delineation of a neuropsychological profile has been the subject of much recent debate. Limited research, including the current CIFASD consortium, has examined if prenatal alcohol exposure results in general dysfunction or a more specific neurobehavioral profile of strengths and weaknesses. The primary aim of this project is to determine whether a neurobehavioral phenotype exists in children with fetal alcohol syndrome, whether the same phenotype exists in children with FASD who lack facial dysmorphology, and whether the phenotype can be used for differential diagnosis. Secondary aims, involving collaboration with other CIFASD projects and cores, are to determine the relationship between brain dysmorphology, facial dysmorphology, and neurobehavioral function. These aims are in keeping with the overall aims of the CIFASD, including enhanced understanding of the neurobehavioral phenotype and establishment of standardized diagnostic criteria and methods of assessment of FASD. A standard neurobehavioral protocol will be administered to four groups of children at six sites and will address the functional domains of executive function, working memory, verbal function, and psychological symptomatology. In addition to children with FASD and nonexposed controls, children with low IQ scores or ADHD will be included as contrast samples. Using this heterogeneous sample and multivariate statistical methods, neurobehavioral profile specific to FASD will be sought. In addition, participants will be assessed using methodology prescribed by the Dysmorphology Core and the facial and brain imaging projects of the CIFASD. Data from three broad domains (neurobehavior, dysmorphology, and brain morphology and function) will be analyzed both separately and together to address the main aim of the CIFASD: improving the diagnostic criteria for FASD. This project is directly relevant to public health concerns surrounding the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, improving diagnosis of alcohol-affected individuals, and defining the profile of neurobehavioral effects that are specific to FASD. Improved identification and delineation of these features will ultimately lead to improved treatment.           n/a",A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,7343382,U01AA014834,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plague', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Score', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'statistics', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2007,740297,35319116,0.2812131297450563
