"Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior Project Summary / Abstract High-throughput experimental neuroscience has made it possible to observe behavior of many animals, as well as a large groups of neurons simultaneously, providing an exciting opportunity for figuring out how the neural system performs computations that underlie perception, cognition, and behavior. However, there is a major bottleneck in the scientific cycle of data analysis and data collection due to the complexity and scale of noisy, high-dimensional data. The primary objective of this project is to develop tools for tracking the internal state of the brain that are not directly measurable from both the behavior and neural signals, and to generate optimal stimulus corresponding to the current brain state. These external stimuli can be used to perturb the animal’s belief or strategy about the world such that the animal would behave differently. Aim 1: Our team will develop a neural state tracking system that will parse out and display complex neural signals recorded from the animal brain in real-time. The neural state tracking algorithm will also extract the law that the neural system operates under, allowing neuroscientist to generate a new class of hypotheses about the population level implementation underlying intelligent behavior. Aim 2: To causally test hypothesis on how population of neurons compute and produce meaningful behavior, it is necessary to be able to perturb the internal computation process. We will develop a feedback control system to perturb the neural dynamics at a short time scale with a novel control scheme for neural computation that respects the brain’s own degrees of freedom. Aim 3: By understanding and tracking the time evolution of internal strategy throughout learning, we can learn how to optimize the training of animal behavior. In this aim, we will develop statistical models of learning and a computational system to generate the best stimuli based on the past performance of the animal. The statistical tools developed in this project will likely accelerate fundamental discoveries in neuroscience. Clinically, this research can extend to monitoring, diagnosing, and building next- generation real-time feedback stimulation devices for disorders with a neurodynamic or behavioral component such as Parkinson’s disease, autism, learning disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, and epilepsy. We will develop new tools to train animals faster for further experiments, and to understand inner  workings of animal brains. These tools will visualize how the internal states change over time as  it happens while the animal is engaged in simple behavior.",Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior,10001503,R01EB026946,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Closure by clamp', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lateral', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Learning Disorders', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operating System', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Scheme', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visualization', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'multidimensional data', 'neglect', 'neurotransmission', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2020,7509,77607041,0.010990040667500789
"2020 Neurobiology of Cognition Gordon Research Conference SUMMARY This proposal requests support for the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on the Neurobiology of Cognition. The driving force behind the GRC is the rapid pace of convergent findings in molecular, cellular circuit and systems neuroscience, augmented by technical developments in cell-targeting, imaging, computation and brain-machine interfaces. As a result, there are rapidly evolving descriptions of neuronal circuits and dynamics, neurophysiological processes and computational principles that underpin cognitive functions. Together, these approaches that include different brain models, and levels of analyses and involve an interdisciplinary research community will get us closer to one of the ultimate goals of the field of cognitive neuroscience – to explain human cognition. The overarching goal of this GRC is to promote communication and collaboration across relevant levels of analysis and among empirical scientists, theoreticians and technical development specialists, emphasizing the most recent findings. The associated GRS, held just prior to the GRC, is designed to provide opportunities for doctoral and post-doctoral trainees to communicate their most recent findings and perspectives, and to prepare them for more in-depth participation in the parent GRC that immediately follows. Along with recent findings in traditional “core” areas such as memory and motor cognition, formal sessions will explore several new themes, including: 1) the role of subcortical structures such as the thalamus in perception and cognition, 2) a discussion on the many ways neural information may be encoded across different levels from local ensembles to large scale circuits, 3) an overview of recent developments to probe neural circuits beyond the traditional microelectrode recording including several brain models (rodents, non-human primates and humans), and 4) an exploration of the relation of our field to computer science and artificial intelligence. The program is highly interdisciplinary, bringing together behavioral, neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques in humans and non-human animals with computational approaches that explicate empirical findings and construct realistic models to represent the developing picture of cognitive operations and guide future experimentation. The program also underscores novel, state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical approaches that promise to define fundamental principles of cognition, and to extend these to improved treatment of brain dysfunction. The format of the meeting promotes intensive interactions among investigators and trainees from different perspectives and analytic levels, and in particular, between experimentalists and theorists. HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The goal of this conference is to promote communication and collaboration among empirical scientists and theoreticians working in the field of cognitive neuroscience with the focus on the improved understanding of the biological basis of perception, memory, motor cognition, decision-making and its relation to artificial intelligence. Insights into the neural basis of these fundamental cognitive processes, will lead to improved diagnoses and treatment of many cognitive disorders with profound implications for society, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and autism and will inform the further development of brain machine interfaces.",2020 Neurobiology of Cognition Gordon Research Conference,10070417,R13NS116969,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fostering', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Memory', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Perception', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'To specify', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'brain dysfunction', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive task', 'computer science', 'design', 'driving force', 'genetic manipulation', 'improved', 'insight', 'meetings', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'peer', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'symposium', 'targeted imaging']",NINDS,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2020,15000,740405,0.011122205395612766
"Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  This revised NIH Individual Fellowship Award (F30) proposal seeks to develop career-specific skills and knowledge of the behavioral contributions and underlying neural mechanisms associated with co-occurring drug use disorder (DUD) and other psychiatric illnesses. The diagnosis of DUD comorbidity is well established clinically, and is prone to more difficult and expensive treatment plans and worse treatment outcomes than either diagnosis alone. Despite the prevalence and clinical significance of DUD comorbidity, few studies have characterized the interactions between environment, behavior, and neural organizations that contribute to DUD comorbidity illness trajectories. Cognitions related to self-beliefs and self-directed behaviors are compromised in individuals with DUD, depression, or PTSD, yet the altered neural circuitry underlying such deficits in comorbid individuals has not been studied. The overall research goal of the proposed project is therefore to identify traits associated with functional neural networks underlying DUD comorbidity and determine how changes in network organization lead to deficits in self-related cognitions in comorbid individuals. Additionally, machine-learning computational models will be trained on Big Data to classify brain-wide patterns of network organization at two distinct stages of DUD comorbidity development. The proposal includes a rigorous training plan for the candidate to gain expertise in neuroimaging methodology and advanced computational approaches to neuroimaging data (e.g., structural equation modeling, machine learning, and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)). An increasingly large data sample (n=550+) of adults and adolescents 12-60 years old will be used to test the aims of this proposal. In Aim 1, controlling for age and sex, environmental variables and self-beliefs will be related to the expression of DUD comorbidity. Using whole-brain mediation analyses, significant traits will then be related to areas of brain activation, with focus on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Aim 2 will use structural equation modeling to test how sex-specific changes in ACC networks are related to self-regulation in individuals with DUD and DUD comorbidity compared to healthy individuals. Aim 3 will use MVPA-derived computational models to classify whole-brain patterns of activity that characterize susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence and sustained comorbidity in adulthood. By classifying brain activity underlying DUD comorbidity at two separate stages of disorder development, this project will help pave the way for future research into more effective treatment methods and better preventative efforts to preclude DUD comorbidity. The career development milestones related to computational psychiatry – clinical medicine, responsible conduct of research, and computational neuroscience – will be attained via this mentored research proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development project seeks to use a Big Data approach to characterize the expression of drug use disorder (DUD) comorbidity. The multilayer project will develop skills and knowledge to support a better understanding of the behaviors and underlying neural mechanisms associated with self-related cognitions in DUD comorbidity. An innovative machine-learning pattern classifier will then be used to identify whole-brain resting-state activation patterns associated with susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence, and sustained comorbidity in adulthood.",Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity,9882986,F30DA043928,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equation', 'Exclusion', 'Fellowship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Perception', 'Self-Direction', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavioral deficiency', 'career', 'career development', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'early life stress', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multilevel analysis', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neural patterning', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'responsible research conduct', 'sex', 'skills', 'sociodemographics', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'working group']",NIDA,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,F30,2020,16736,54868437,0.013467278124308963
"ADAR-editing landscape dysregulation in neuropsychiatric disorders Project Abstract:  Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) editing plays a major role in shaping transcriptome diversity by creating variant isoforms that enable fine-tuning of calcium-mediated excitatory and other signaling needed for brain development, neural plasticity and mood regulation. The spatio-temporal ADAR editing landscapes are tightly regulated by controlling ADAR expression levels to preserve preferential binding and editing. Previous studies have shown that activation of the interferon pathways of the innate immune system – such as those seen in viral infections - leads to increased expression of ADAR1p150, which ultimately results in changes to ADAR editing patterns. Furthermore, common side effects to innate immune activation by interferon alpha therapies include increased risk of depression and suicide. The changes in spatio-temporal regulation of editing patterns can lead to a wide spectrum of neurological symptoms, including neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., decreased ADAR editing in the serotonin receptor subunit2C in the prefrontal cortex observed in individuals who commit suicide). Yet, our understanding of ADAR editing landscapes remain cursory. Advances in high throughput RNA-seq enable more accurate variant calling from the sequencing reads, providing a way to map ADAR editing patterns in the transcriptome. However, there are no computational pipelines focused on ADAR editing that are easy to use, are reproducible and can handle large scale analysis. I have recently built a pipeline to handle meta-analysis of RNA-seq data that incorporates variant calling steps, but further work is needed to validate this tool to assure accuracy and reproducibility of results. It can then be used to map the spatio-temporal variation of ADAR editing landscapes. The proposed project will study ADAR editing landscapes in the following ways: (i) new computational pipelines will be benchmarked to use variant calling with RNA-seq datasets using simulated reads, (ii) ADAR editing landscape diversity in the publicly available human samples will be mapped; the computational predictions and hypotheses generated from the pipeline will be validated using (iii) measuring calcium flux in cells with known differential ADAR editing landscapes caused by PolyI:C (viral infection mimic) treatment. The proposed work will yield a validated pipeline capable of mapping ADAR editing landscapes with machine learning algorithms. Defining ADAR editing landscapes is paramount to biomarker discovery and can influence precision medicine applications in diagnosis and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. This project will allow for me to gain the knowledge base necessary to become an independent researcher with a unique skill set of both computational and benchwork methods to advance the field of neuroscience. Project Narrative Inferring ADAR editing landscapes and their link with ion homeostasis and excitatory signaling in the brain is important for understanding, diagnosing or staging neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder and suicide. This proposed project will develop and validate computational tools to use RNA-seq from publicly available datasets for ADAR editing inferences and to delineate patterns of editing changes in cells experiencing viral infections. Overall, this project will give me the training to build my unique skill set of both computational and experimental methods that will enable me as an independent researcher to bridge the gap between bioinformatics and experimental researchers and translate my findings into precision medicine.",ADAR-editing landscape dysregulation in neuropsychiatric disorders,9992699,F31MH123131,"['Accounting', 'Anxiety', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Economic Burden', 'Etiology', 'Frequencies', 'Fura-2', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Glutamate Receptor', 'High-Throughput RNA Sequencing', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Innate Immune System', 'Interferon Activation', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Ions', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic Symptoms', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'PF4 Gene', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'accomplished suicide', 'adenosine deaminase', 'biomarker discovery', 'computational pipelines', 'computerized tools', 'data visualization', 'detector', 'differential expression', 'disability-adjusted life years', 'dopaminergic differentiation', 'excitotoxicity', 'experience', 'immune activation', 'in silico', 'innate immune pathways', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mood regulation', 'nerve stem cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel marker', 'precision medicine', 'preservation', 'relating to nervous system', 'release of sequestered calcium ion into cytoplasm', 'serotonin receptor', 'side effect', 'skills', 'social', 'spatiotemporal', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virtual machine']",NIMH,KENT STATE UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,29830,5062280,-0.07799545775787635
"Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making ABSTRACT Evaluating risk and reward potential in the execution of motivated behaviors is important in decision-making. Positive valence systems in the brain encode positive stimuli and play a key role in motivation, reward expectance, and appetitive behavior. Negative valence systems, on the other hand, encode negative stimuli such as fear and anxiety, and drive avoidance. Critically, an imbalance in these valence systems is thought to underlie many core symptoms in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Recent studies have shown that the brain regions responsible for encoding these divergent valence systems have anatomical and functional overlap. This raises the hypothesis that differences in network-level activity involving these overlapping areas may discriminate information of positive and negative valence. Here, I propose to employ in vivo recordings of electrical activity across multiple brain regions concurrently as mice perform a behavioral task designed to probe both reward and aversion. This task, modeled after the classic elevated plus maze and sucrose preference tasks, will directly quantify the impact of anxiogenic stimuli on reward-motivated behavior. Using machine-learning techniques, I will then generate neural models that reflect the network-level activity engaged during the performance of this task. I anticipate that this strategy with discover an independent network that corresponds with the positive valence system, and another independent network that corresponds with the negative valence system. I also anticipate that I will discover a network that directly integrates network-level activity in these two systems to drive decisions making. Lastly, the structure of these networks will be validated in a cohort of mice that will be subjected to chronic social defeat stress. A validated model of MDD, chronic social defeat stress induces increased anxiety-like phenotypes and decreased reward drive in a subset of mice (stress-susceptible mice) while only increasing anxiety-like phenotypes in other animals (stress-resilient mice). Thus, successful completion of the proposed work will lead to a network-level understanding of positive and negative valence systems. Furthermore, the framework discovered through this study has the potential to facilitate the development of new revolutionary approaches for diagnosis and treatment of MDD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making Valence systems in the brain are responsible for encoding the response to positive and negative experiences. Altered interaction between positive and negative valence systems may play a role in the maladaptive behaviors observed in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Using in vivo recordings of electrical activity across key brain regions, we will uncover how the brain encodes reward and punishment at the network level. Findings from this work will provide insight into the diagnosis of MDD characterized by valence imbalance.",Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making,9813516,F30MH118888,"['Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equilibrium', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Negative Valence', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Sucrose', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Work', 'avoidance behavior', 'base', 'chronic depression', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'depression model', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'goal oriented behavior', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'light intensity', 'millisecond', 'motivated behavior', 'mouse model', 'neural model', 'optogenetics', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'segregation', 'social defeat', 'spatiotemporal']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,37351,607172798,0.0025314164881627545
"Computational ontology of brain systems across the human neuroimaging literature Project Summary/Abstract Symptom-based diagnoses of mental illness are highly comorbid, biologically heterogeneous, and poorly predictive of treatment response. The National Institute of Mental Health has led efforts to redefine mental illness by its biological causes, establishing the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework as a guide for investigating variation in basic brain systems. RDoC has been influential, named in hundreds of grants and publications, but it has yet to be systematically validated. It is unknown whether circuit-function links underlying the RDoC brain systems are reproducible across studies, and organizing principles remain largely untested. While the structure of RDoC as a modular hierarchy has evidence in resting state analyses, it has not been shown whether this applies to systems that support the diverse mental states affected in psychiatric disease. It is necessary to validate RDoC, and moreover, to establish fundamental principles of organization for systems defined jointly by human brain structure and function. The objective of this proposal is to apply large- scale computational neuroimaging meta-analyses to build a data-driven ontology that will not only serve as a benchmark in evaluating the validity of RDoC but also characterize the architecture of systems for human brain function. The long-term goal is to redefine mental illness by differences from healthy function within the brain systems of a data-driven ontology, facilitating rational targeting of neuromodulation treatments. The proposed meta-analyses will be the most comprehensive in the field with 18,155 MRI and PET studies already collected. The mental functions considered in these studies have been extracted from article texts using natural language processing, and brain circuits will be mapped from the brain coordinate data that were reported. The hypothesis is that brain systems are comprised of reproducible circuit-function links organized into a modular hierarchy, which for some systems will require updates to RDoC. This will be tested by comparing RDoC systems against those of a data-driven ontology. Aim 1: The reproducibility of circuit-function links will be evaluated by the performance of neural network classifiers predicting functions in article texts from circuits in brain scan data, and vice versa. Aim 2: The modularity of brain systems will be evaluated by a graph theoretic approach, and hierarchical structure will be assessed by representational similarity analysis. The impact of this project will be to validate the foremost psychiatry research framework and to characterize human brain systems through an innovative computational strategy. Together with targeted academic training in neurobiology, the fellowship is designed to offer preparation for a career as a physician-scientist leading advances in computational psychiatry. Training will be supported by an environment that combines world-class computing resources with esteemed and engaged mentors in psychiatry, neuroscience, and computer science. Project Narrative First-line treatments routinely fail for most of the 45 million US adults living with mental illness because psychiatric diagnoses lack a biological basis, making them unreliable predictors of treatment response. The proposed project will lay the foundation for a biologically based diagnostic system in psychiatry by characterizing the composition and structure of human brain systems through innovative computational meta-analyses of nearly 20,000 neuroimaging articles. When it is understood what makes up a brain system and how systems are organized, mental illness can be redefined by variation from healthy function, facilitating successful targeting of brain-based treatments.",Computational ontology of brain systems across the human neuroimaging literature,9991669,F30MH120956,"['Academic Training', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Base of the Brain', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Brain scan', 'Cognitive', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Expert Opinion', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Ontology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Preparation', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mental function', 'mental state', 'neural network classifier', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuroregulation', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'system architecture']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,37706,560644462,0.021092321901289384
"A novel multi-modal, multi-scale imaging pipeline for the validation of diffusion MRI of the brain Project Summary  In this project, we propose to validate and characterize ﬁber orientation estimation from diffusion tensor imag- ing (DTI) through the optimization of a multi-modality, multi-scale imaging pipeline for whole mouse brains. DTI is a powerful tool used to noninvasively report 3D microstructural properties of nervous tissue on a macroscopic scale, and has played an important role in the understanding and diagnosis of a number of neurological disease processes. Modern acquisitions of DTI data can be processed to generate a 3D diffusion proﬁle known as an orientation diffusion function (ODF) at each voxel. The ODF is used to infer the orientation of local axon ﬁber pop- ulations. Previous efforts to validate these orientation estimates have primarily relied on serial optical histology as a ground truth dataset. Histology-based pipelines involve the labor intensive task of physically sectioning the tissue into thin slices, leading to physical destruction of the sample and anisotropic resolution. These limitations potentially confound the accuracy of 3D orientation estimation, complicate the process of spatially registering the ground-truth and DTI datasets, and limit quantitative comparisons to select regions of interest (ROI) across the brain sample.  In recent years, synchrotron x-ray microcomputed tomography (microCT) has emerged as a powerful tool for high-resolution tissue imaging. With a mosaic projection-stitching method, a whole mouse brain can be imaged at an isotropic, 3D resolution of 1.2 microns after prior imaging with DTI. To enhance microCT contrast, the tis- sue specimens are ﬁxed and stained with the same kind of metal-based stains used in electron microscopy (EM) prior to embedding in resin. We will optimize this microCT-EM validation pipeline to address the limitations of pre- vious histology-based studies, and characterize DTI algorithm performance across a whole mouse brain using micron- to nano-scale neurological information.  The speciﬁc aims of the proposal are: (1) model phase contrast to optimize microCT data acquisition, (2) vali- date DTI ODF reconstruction methods using ground-truth microCT (3) characterize DTI performance using under- lying tissue microstructure information from EM. Upon completion, aim 1 will generate a novel theoretical model and acquisition strategy to exploit microCT phase contrast in strongly absorbing biological samples. Aim 2 will generate a ground-truth dataset of ODFs across a whole mouse brain, which will be used to calculate algorithm- speciﬁc spatial maps of DTI performance. In Aim 3, around 20 ROI will be selected for nano-scale imaging with EM, and DTI performance will be characterized by quantitative features of the underlying neural architecture. These results will provide an unprecedented microstructure-driven understanding of the DTI signal, allowing fu- ture studies to develop more advanced DTI models and acquisition strategies to better leverage ﬁber orientation and connectivity information in the treatment of neurological disease. Project Narrative The goal of the proposed research is to use synchrotron x-ray microcomputed tomography and serial electron microscopy to validate diffusion MRI reconstruction methods. This unprecedented pipeline allows for imaging the same tissue across scales ranging from hundreds of microns to tens of nanometers. The high resolution modalities will provide insight into the true neurological microstructure driving the diffusion MRI signal, leading to better modeling and increased clinical and research utility.","A novel multi-modal, multi-scale imaging pipeline for the validation of diffusion MRI of the brain",9987313,F31NS113571,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Mus', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neurologic', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plant Resins', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Synchrotrons', 'Techniques', 'Theoretical model', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Work', 'absorption', 'base', 'contrast enhanced', 'data acquisition', 'electron tomography', 'follow-up', 'image reconstruction', 'insight', 'interest', 'microCT', 'multimodality', 'nanometer', 'nanoscale', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'physical process', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'tractography', 'validation studies']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F31,2020,40827,246330700,0.01052352386379106
"MRI and machine learning to improve early prognosis and clinical management after spinal cord injury PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Purpose/Hypothesis: Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes substantial social, economic, and health burden.1 For individuals with motor incomplete SCI, some basic ability to stand or walk is expected during the recovery process,2 and this is a top priority in rehabilitative programs.3 However, establishing a prognosis for recovering community walking ability is extremely difficult.4 Within 72 hours after SCI,5 edema develops within the damaged spinal cord. This edema is a hallmark of spinal cord injury, expressed as signal hyperintensity using T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).6 Correlations between the sagittal length of this spinal cord edema and walking ability are generally poor.7,8 However, advanced but available high resolution axial T2-weighted MRI to quantify spinal cord edema in people in the acute stage of SCI may improve prediction of walking ability.9,10 The early clinical management and targeted rehabilitation of these individuals could be drastically enhanced, optimizing recovery and rehabilitation outcomes. The main objective of this research project is to use early axial spinal cord MRI sequences as neuroprognostic biomarkers to improve the prediction of residual motor function. This objective will be realized by the implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: To establish to what extent the axial damage ratio biomarker, measured by high-resolution axial T2-weighted structural imaging, can predict residual function in persons with SCI. Previously-collected axial T2-weighted spinal cord structural MRI data of 200 people with SCI from the US Model SCI System at Craig Hospital will be used to quantify cord damage. This metric will be related to the primary 1-year status-post injury outcome measures, which are clinical records of walking ability and function. Multivariate statistical analyses will be applied to create exploratory models to determine the prognostic value of the MRI measures. We hypothesize that the axial damage ratio can be used in the acute stage as an accurate and objective neuroprognostic biomarker of residual motor function. Aim 2: To identify the relationship between damage to specific spinal cord regions and specific motor and sensory deficits. MRI data from Aim 1 will be used. Spinal cord regional damage analysis will be related to right and left upper and lower extremity motor and sensory scores. Correlational statistical analyses will be applied to analyze relationships between specific tract damage and motor/sensory deficits. We hypothesize that damage to descending lateral corticospinal motor regions is related to ipsilesional motor deficits, and that similar findings exist for ascending sensory regions and sensory deficits. For both Aims, we will compare our manual damage quantification to our machine learning approach to automatically detect spinal cord damage. Aim 3: Develop, test, and distribute a machine-learning based analysis pipeline for spinal cord damage measures. We will use functions included in the Spinal Cord Toolbox and the open-source NiftyNet deep-learning platform to develop the machine-learning based analysis pipeline. The processing steps will include spinal cord detection, spinal cord damage segmentation, registration to the spinal cord template, and the calculation and output of the axial damage ratio and regional damage biomarkers. Significance: Successful completion of these Aims will advance the NIH/NICHD NCMRR aim: “to enhance the health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of people with physical disabilities.” The significance of this outcome relates directly to improving the clinical management of SCI. This research may inform clinicians, patients, and families, regarding the percentage chance of regaining walking ability. The healthcare team will be able to determine, early-on, which people will optimally respond to locomotor training. This work will significantly improve the prognosis for recovery of walking and specific motor/sensory function based on early imaging of the damaged spinal cord. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this research project is to use early axial MRI measures of spinal cord damage as objective biomarkers to improve the prediction of walking recovery and specific motor return of individuals following SCI. This research will provide patients with a quantified sense of expectations regarding their chances of walking recovery, and will help guide the healthcare team on the best options for clinical management and rehabilitation (i.e. focusing on neuroplasticity and restoration of walking versus compensatory strategies). Ultimately, this research aims to improve the lives and wellbeing of those suffering from spinal cord injury.

"MRI and machine learning to improve early prognosis and clinical management after spinal cord injury PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Purpose/Hypothesis: Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes substantial social, economic, and health burden.1 For individuals with motor incomplete SCI, some basic ability to stand or walk is expected during the recovery process,2 and this is a top priority in rehabilitative programs.3 However, establishing a prognosis for recovering community walking ability is extremely difficult.4 Within 72 hours after SCI,5 edema develops within the damaged spinal cord. This edema is a hallmark of spinal cord injury, expressed as signal hyperintensity using T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).6 Correlations between the sagittal length of this spinal cord edema and walking ability are generally poor.7,8 However, advanced but available high resolution axial T2-weighted MRI to quantify spinal cord edema in people in the acute stage of SCI may improve prediction of walking ability.9,10 The early clinical management and targeted rehabilitation of these individuals could be drastically enhanced, optimizing recovery and rehabilitation outcomes.

"Novel fMRI Strategy to Assess Consciousness in Brain-Injured Patients Multiple studies have shown that some patients who remain behaviorally unresponsive after severe brain damage can modulate their brain activity in response to command. A lack of response to the command- following paradigm in other patients, however, cannot be taken as evidence that consciousness is absent. There is thus an urgent need for neuroimaging tools that are able to diagnose covert consciousness in behaviorally unresponsive subjects without relying on a task. Previous neuroimaging studies of the neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs) have mostly utilized between-state paradigms (e.g., wakefulness vs. sleep) or report-based contrasts, which conflate differences in brain activity supporting consciousness with differences in brain activity supporting behavior or task response. To address these limitations, my sponsor (Dr. Giulio Tononi) has developed a within-state, no-report paradigm that uses serial awakenings to contrast states of consciousness versus unconsciousness during sleep, a physiological unresponsive state. Using high density electroencephalography (EEG), his group has shown that the occurrence of dreaming consciousness during sleep is associated with a reduction of delta activity (sleep slow waves) in a posterior cortical ‘hot zone’ encompassing occipital, parietal and temporal cortices. To proceed towards clinical applications, it is now essential to confirm and extend these findings using combined EEG-fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging). To this effect, in an important new development, Dr. Tononi and collaborators have recently shown that it is possible to faithfully track EEG slow wave activity during sleep by means of a high-frequency (~0.17 Hz) blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) oscillation evident in fMRI. This finding provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the NCCs during sleep with high spatial resolution, avoiding potential pitfalls of EEG source modeling, and with unrestricted access to subcortical structures. Taking advantage of these new findings, in this project, I propose to combine the novel fMRI signature of sleep slow waves with a serial awakenings paradigm to locate the NCCs during sleep. Specifically, I will acquire fMRI-EEG data during ~1,080 awakenings from sleep across 40 healthy subjects and investigate the neural correlates of the presence versus absence of dreaming consciousness (Aim 1). I hypothesize that high-frequency BOLD oscillation—which tracks sleep slow-waves—will show regional decreases in specific posterior cortical areas during dreaming compared to dreamless sleep. In Aim 2, I will use univariate and multivariate modeling approaches based on high-frequency BOLD power and conventional BOLD amplitude to identify the NCCs of specific dream contents (e.g., presence of faces) and complexity. If successful, the proposed experiments will constitute an important step forward in identifying brain regions that sustain consciousness and its contents during behaviorally unresponsive states. These results can open new avenues to improve clinical care in patients with a DOC and inform the assessment of intraoperative awareness in anesthetized subjects. Due to previous methodological oversights that confounded consciousness and behavior, the neural substrates of covert consciousness in unresponsive states are poorly understood. The current project will use serial awakenings with dream reports combined with a novel functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signature of sleep slow waves to identify the neural correlates of both the presence of consciousness and its contents during sleep, a physiological unresponsive state. The goal is to help clarify a scientific controversy surrounding the neural basis of consciousness at an unprecedented spatial resolution and with an access to subcortical structures, which could ultimately to improve diagnosis through neuroimaging and clinical care for patients with disorders of consciousness.",Novel fMRI Strategy to Assess Consciousness in Brain-Injured Patients,10053237,F32NS114034,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Board Certification', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Conscious', 'Consciousness Disorders', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Dreams', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Fellowship', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Occipital lobe', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Training', 'Traumatic injury', 'Unconscious State', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vegetative States', 'Wakefulness', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'brain research', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'cognitive control', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography', 'fusiform face area', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lens', 'life-sustaining therapy', 'machine learning method', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'selective attention', 'sensory input', 'skills', 'stimulus processing', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F32,2020,67626,338121506,0.017977091003745123
"Multi-modal and Extreme PET/MRI Reconstruction Methods Project Summary / Abstract  Hybrid PET/MRI systems are very advantageous for a variety of clinical applications by combining the soft tissue contrast of MRI with the functional and metabolic information of PET. These systems have found success for oncology studies, particularly in head and abdomen/pelvis, as well as for epilepsy, neurological diseases, heart disease, and pediatrics for dose reduction. However, the PET resolution and SNR is typically worse than MRI, and suffers from the loss of feature and data due to motion as well. PET/MRI systems offer the potential to create more accurate, higher resolution PET reconstructions, including correction of artifacts, motion, and im- proved localization, by performing synergistic reconstructions that leverage the simultaneous data acquisition. In particular, this fellowship proposes to develop novel physics-constrained machine learning models for informa- tion sharing between PET and MRI for enhanced spatial localization, estimation of attenuation and activity, and motion. We propose to develop a deep maximum-likelihood estimation of attenuation and activity (MLAA) that can compensate for artifacts and improve PET reconstruction accuracy. We also propose a motion-enhanced joint PET/MRI reconstruction to capture arbitrary motions and reduce dose requirements for chest and abdomen studies. Together, these models aim to improve the PET spatio-temporal resolution, SNR, and quantiﬁcation for a broad range of clinical applications, and will be evaluated for cancer assessment in the pelvis, liver, and lung.  This fellowship will be performed in the Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging at UCSF under the guidance of Prof. Peder Larson, who leads a research program on advanced imaging methods development, and Dr. Thomas Hope, a radiologist and nuclear medicine physician who leads multiple PET/MRI projects. The Department is one of the leading centers in biomedical imaging research, and has been at the forefront on translating PET/MRI systems into clinical practice. The UCSF PET/MRI scanner has dedicated research time, which is also available on other MRI and PET/CT research systems, and extensive computational resources to support the proposed project. The applicant, Dr. Abhejit Rajagopal, has a background in computational imaging and machine learning, will be jointly mentored by this engineer/physician team. He will be trained to become a biomedical imaging scientist by participating in formal coursework on medical imaging systems, training on the PET/MRI system, grant writing, and performing clinical research, supporting his development into a creative, independent biomedical researcher. Project Narrative  Hybrid positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imagery (MRI) imaging systems cur- rently aid in diagnosis and prognosis of numerous types of cancer and disease, but are not always precise enough to accurately measure and track a patient’s response to therapy, particularly in organs and tissue that are sub- ject to motion. There is an unrealized potential here to synergistically combine complimentary PET-MRI data to dramatically improve the spatial resolution and SNR of PET, as well as to create motion-resolved 4D (x,y,z,t) imagery by combining information across modalities and time-frames to combat severe undersampling. These methods will be evaluated in human studies of cancer to capture ﬁne structure and micro-features on moving organs (e.g. lung nodules, liver metastases), ultimately aiding in quantitative characterization of disease.",Multi-modal and Extreme PET/MRI Reconstruction Methods,10069132,F32EB030411,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Chest', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Fellowship', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Implant', 'Joint repair', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metals', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Oncology', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Writing', 'attenuation', 'bioimaging', 'bone', 'cancer type', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'combat', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'heart imaging', 'high resolution imaging', 'imaging modality', 'imaging scientist', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'information model', 'lung imaging', 'method development', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'programs', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'soft tissue', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'systems research', 'uptake']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2020,69426,685608202,-0.01526549156894201
"Input-specific imaging and manipulation of synaptic plasticity underlying social memory Project Summary / Abstract Ascertaining the neural basis of behavior has been a cornerstone goal since the conception of neurobiology. While activity recording and loss-of-function studies have shed light on brain regions involved and necessary for the expression of certain behaviors, they are unable to determine the information each circuit is responsible for encoding. Therefore, when different nodes in the circuit are removed, the behavioral phenotype is often identical. Synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to change functional strength depending on experience, is considered the cellular correlate of learning and memory. Linking changes in the functional strength of synapses following behavior has begun to indicate what information circuits are responsible for encoding. To provide direct evidence, a tool that is able to modulate synaptic plasticity in specific circuit nodes during behavior is needed. The goal of this proposal is to create a photo-activatable inhibitor of presynaptic plasticity that will be input- and region- specific for use in behaving animals. The first aim of the proposal will create and screen constructs of photo-activatable PKI (paPKI) in their efficacy for the inhibition of protein kinase A, a kinase necessary for the induction of presynaptic plasticity. Light-dependency will be ensured and the construct will be evaluated based on its sensitivity and selectivity using advanced imaging techniques (2-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging) and biochemical assays. The second aim of the proposal will use paPKI to determine the role of specific circuit nodes in social memory. Input-specific modulation of plasticity will be paired with in depth behavioral analyses using computer vision to parse out subtle differences in social interaction. These aims directly address the BRAIN Initiative 2025 high priority goal #4: the modulation of neural activity with readouts of behavior using advanced computer vision techniques. The proposed fellowship project provides excellent training potential as it expands from the applicant’s current training in systems/circuit neuroscience to molecular and biophysical neuroscience. The project is an intersection between the mentor’s, Dr. Ryohei Yasuda, expertise in molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and the development and advanced imaging of biomodulators and sensors, and the applicant’s expertise in circuitry underlying social memory, electrophysiology and behavioral analyses using computer vision. The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience is an intensely collaborative environment filled with leaders in the field and exceptional resources, resulting in an institute that is highly productive and influential. This fellowship proposal presents excellent training potential and aims to produce tools that will advance the field. Project Narrative While the ability to discern an appropriate behavioral response during social encounters is of quintessential importance in communally living animals, the neural circuitry storing social memories that guide this behavioral choice are poorly understood. Here, we will harness and develop novel molecular tools to manipulate synaptic plasticity in an input-specific manner to discern the specific role of each node in a social memory circuit. Additionally, the tools developed in this proposal will be applicable to studies discerning the neural circuitry underlying other forms of learning and memory facilitating greater understanding of neural computations underlying behavior and how these may be altered in neuropsychiatric diseases.",Input-specific imaging and manipulation of synaptic plasticity underlying social memory,9962148,F32MH120872,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Animals', 'Assessment tool', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'Biophysics', 'Brain region', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Conceptions', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Fellowship', 'Florida', 'Goals', 'Hela Cells', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Protein Inhibition', 'Protein Kinase A Inhibitor', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Characteristics', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'behavioral response', 'calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'commune', 'experience', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'link protein', 'loss of function', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'novel', 'optical fiber', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'protein kinase inhibitor', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'sensor', 'social', 'social learning', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NIMH,MAX PLANCK FLORIDA CORPORATION,F32,2020,69926,5627670,0.004760531615251218
"New Photo-Acoustic Imaging Process in Fetal Monitoring to Dramatically Reduce Brain Injuries in Newborns PROJECT SUMMARY Summary The Brimrose Technology Corporation and Johns Hopkins University are forming a powerful new team to make a new instrument that has the potential to dramatically reduce a major global health problem–perinatal hypoxic- ischemic encephalopathy (HIE)–by enabling early detection during labor. HIE caused by asphyxia is a leading cause of infant fatalities as well as a source of cerebral palsy and other long-term severe neurologic impairments. The medical community has been limited in early diagnosis of HIE because current fetal heart rate monitoring has poor specificity. If identified early, HIE can be treated effectively with therapeutic hypothermia. We are proposing a fetal photoacoustic monitoring system that measures oxyhemoglobin saturation of the sagittal sinus vein draining the fetal cerebral cortex during labor. Sagittal sinus oxyhemoglobin saturation decreases to very low levels when placental gas exchange is impaired (hypoxia) and/or when fetal cerebral perfusion pressure falls (ischemia). The photoacoustic instrument transmits light through the open fontanelle or bone and into cerebral veins and tissue where ultrasound waves are generated. Using near- infrared incident light at discrete wavelengths that are absorbed preferentially by oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin, ultrasound detected on the fetal scalp at each wavelength can estimate oxyhemoglobin saturation. Brimrose has constructed a novel ultrasound detection technology with sensitivity orders of magnitude greater than the current best-use piezo-electric sensors. This will permit the use of low-power LED light sources rather than cumbersome laser lights now employed, thereby avoiding safety goggle use and promoting greater deployment. The Hopkins team has already validated the ability of a standard photoacoustic system to accurately estimate sagittal sinus oxyhemoglobin saturation through the skull of newborn piglets. The purpose of Phase I is to demonstrate the feasibility of using safe, low power LED light sources with the new ultrasensitive ultrasound sensor to detect critically low sagittal sinus oxyhemoglobin saturation when oxygenation is manipulated. The platform will be based on in-silico simulation to optimize the acoustic and optical pathways for the skull and brain. Real-time measurements on a time scale of seconds will inform the obstetric caregiver of dynamic fluctuations of brain oxygenation during contractions. The Phase II goal is to make a miniaturized photoacoustic device prototype that can report on fetal brain oxygenation. We believe the resulting instrument will provide early detection brain HI with greater specificity and sensitivity, enabling early intervention and treatment and is potentially transferrable to a commercial model for manufacture. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Brimrose Technology Corporation and the Johns Hopkins University propose making a new instrument to potentially dramatically reduce the incidence of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), which can result in mortality or lifelong disabilities. Our goal is to develop an intrapartum fetal brain monitor using photoacoustics with inexpensive, safe and clinically convenient light emitting diodes (LEDs) to noninvasively and instantaneously identify the fetus at risk for brain injury. Phase I is intended to provide a proof-of-concept using low power LED light sources and a novel ultrasensitive ultrasound detector rather than standard laser light sources and piezo-electric detectors.",New Photo-Acoustic Imaging Process in Fetal Monitoring to Dramatically Reduce Brain Injuries in Newborns,10010328,R43HD102260,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Aluminum', 'Animals', 'Asphyxia', 'Auscultation', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cerebral perfusion pressure', 'Cerebrum', 'Cesarean section', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electricity', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Monitoring', 'Fetus', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hybrids', 'Hypoxia', 'Imaging Device', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Legal patent', 'Light', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic acidosis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Neodymium', 'Neonatal', 'Neurologic', 'Newborn Infant', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Oxyhemoglobin', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perinatal anoxic ischemic brain injury', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sagittal Sinus', 'Scalp structure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Structure of fontanel of skull', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonic wave', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Veins', 'Venous', 'Yttrium', 'absorption', 'base', 'bone', 'cerebral oxygenation', 'cerebral vein', 'chromophore', 'commercialization', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'cranium', 'detector', 'disability', 'energy density', 'falls', 'fetal', 'fetal brain injury', 'fetus at risk', 'global health', 'hazard', 'heart rate monitor', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'intrapartum', 'light scattering', 'machine learning method', 'microphone', 'miniaturize', 'mortality', 'natural hypothermia', 'neonatal brain', 'neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury', 'novel', 'photoacoustic imaging', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'sound', 'temporal measurement', 'virtual']",NICHD,BRIMROSE TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION,R43,2020,74989,149978,-0.012153798066329692
"Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD Abstract Up to 80% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) will suffer from cognitive symptoms, including impaired attention, planning, reasoning and working memory as well as hallucinations, visuospatial dysfunction, and delusions. These impairments lead to mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PDD) in PD. Cognitive symptoms of PD are associated with enormous cost to our society. There are no clear biomarkers and few effective treatments for PD-MCI/PDD. Because risk for PD increases dramatically with age, this problem will surge as our population grows older. The mechanisms contributing to PD-MCI/PDD are unknown. Our group has found that low-frequency (1-8 Hz; or delta/theta bands) brain rhythms might be helpful in diagnosing cognitive dysfunction in PD. This delta/theta activity originates from areas of medial frontal cortex such as the anterior cingulate, and is detectable by mid-frontal scalp EEG electrodes. We have found that mid-frontal delta/theta brain rhythms are engaged when healthy individuals detect novelty, errors, and conflict, or make decisions. These rhythms are attenuated in PD patients. Our working model is that PD patients manifest diverse neuronal and network deficits that impair mid-frontal delta/theta activity, leading to failures in engaging cognitive control. These abnormalities contribute to PD-MCI and PDD. In this proposal we combine `big-data' machine learning tools, intraoperative neurophysiology in humans, and new brain-stimulation paradigms to investigate the role of mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms in PD. We will test the overall hypothesis that mid-frontal delta/theta impairments are a mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in PD. In Aim 1 we will determine if mid-frontal delta/theta activity predicts PD-MCI/PDD. In Aim 2 we will use unique intraoperative recordings to determine how delta/theta activity within medial frontal cortex influences neurons in the subthalamic nucleus, a key site of functional convergence that is targeted by current deep-brain stimulation for PD. Notably, the subthalamic nucleus is a compact structure that receives highly overlapping input from cognitive and motor cortical regions, making it likely that our recordings will capture cognitive processing within this nucleus. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine if subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation at delta/theta frequencies improves cognitive control in PD patients. Because these experiments involve recordings across several PD patient populations (Aim 1), from single subthalamic neurons (Aim 2), and brain stimulation (Aim 3), each of these aims will provide independent mechanistic insight into cognitive dysfunction in PD. PD is a complex disease, but if cortical EEG abnormalities are a consistent theme it might inspire new diagnostic tools or new brain-stimulation therapies for cognitive dysfunction in PD. Results from this proposal could also be important for other neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease.     Public Health Relevance Cognitive symptoms of Parkinson's disease are an enormous public health problem. Here, we will ana- lyze brain rhythms that are involved in cognitive processing and also dysfunctional in Parkinson's dis- ease. We will use these brain rhythms to guide novel brain stimulation that has the potential to treat dementia and cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease.  ",Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD,9961678,R01NS100849,"['Acetylcholine', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alpha Rhythm', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reaction Time', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theta Rhythm', 'Time', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'alpha synuclein', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive impairment in Parkinson&apos', 's', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'implantation', 'improved', 'insight', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'motor symptom', 'neuronal patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2020,75097,193405667,0.03445585380935535
"Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets Project Summary  Morphometric analysis is a primary algorithmic tool to discover disease and drug related effects on brain anatomy. Neurological degeneration and disease manifest in subtle and varied changes in brain anatomy that can be non-local in nature and effect amounts of white and gray matter as well as relative positioning and shapes of local brain anatomy. State-of-the-art morphometry methods focus on local matter distribution or on shape variations of apriori selected anatomies but have difficulty in detecting global or regional deterioration of matter; an important effect in many neurodegenerative processes. The proposal team recently developed a morphometric analysis based on unbalanced optimal transport, called UTM, that promises to be capable to discover local and global alteration of matter without the need to apriori select an anatomical region of interest.  The goal of this proposal is to develop the UTM technology into a software tool for automated high-throughput screening of large neurological image data sets. A more sensitive automated morphometric analysis tool will help researchers to discover neurological effects related to disease and lead to more efficient screening for drug related effects. Project Narrative  Describing anatomical differences in neurological image data set is a key technology to non-invasively discover the effects of disease processes or drug treatments on brain anatomy. Current morphometric analysis focus on local matter composition and on the shape of a priori defined regions of interest. The goal of this proposal is to extend the capabilities of image based morphometric analysis to be able to discover regionally varying deterioration and alteration of matter without the need for fine-grained segmentations and a priori definitions of regions of interest.",Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets,10115288,R41MH118845,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Effect', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'high throughput screening', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'morphometry', 'nervous system disorder', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'research and development', 'shape analysis', 'software development', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'web services', 'white matter']",NIMH,"KITWARE, INC.",R41,2020,99860,5161939,-0.003931114232861853
"Fast motion-robust fetal neuroimaging with MRI PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Fetal-brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an invaluable tool for studying the early development of the brain and can resolve diagnostic ambiguities that may remain after routine ultrasound exams. Unfortunately, high levels of fetal and maternal motion (1) limit fetal MRI to rapid two-dimensional (2D) sequences and frequently introduce dramatic artifacts such as (2) image misorientation relative to the standard sagittal, coronal, axial planes needed for clinical assessment and (3) partial to complete signal loss. These factors lead to the inefficient practice of repeating ~30 s stack-of-slices acquisitions until motion-free images have been obtained. Throughout the session, technologists manually adjust the orientation of scans in response to motion, and about 38% of datasets are typically discarded. Thus, subject motion is the fundamental impediment to reaping the full benefits of MRI for answering clinical and investigational questions in the fetus. The overarching goal of this project is to overcome the challenges posed by motion by exploiting innovations in deep learning, which have enabled image-analysis algorithms with unprecedented speed and reliability. We propose to integrate these into the MRI acquisition pipeline to unlock the potential of fetal MRI. We will develop practical pulse-sequence technology for automated and dynamically motion-corrected fetal neuroimaging without the need for external hardware or calibration. We hypothesize that this will radically improve the quality and success rates of clinical and research studies, while dramatically reducing patient discomfort and cost. We propose as Aim 1 to eradicate (2) the vulnerability of acquisitions to image-brain misorientation with rapid, automated prescription of standard anatomical planes. In Aim 2, we propose to address (3) motion during the scan with real-time correction of fetal-head motion. An anatomical stack-of-slices acquisition will be interleaved with volumetric navigators. These will be used to measure motion as it happens in the scanner and to adaptively update the slice tilt/position. We propose as Aim 3 to develop a 3D radial sequence and estimate motion between subsets of radial spokes for real-time self-navigation. Adaptively updating the orientation of spokes and selectively re-acquiring corrupted subsets at the end of the scan will enable 3D imaging of the fetal brain (1). Since the applicant has a physics background, the proposed training program at MIT and HMS will focus on deep learning and fetal development/neuroscience during the K99 phase to develop the skills needed for transitioning to independence in the R00 phase. The applicant’s goal is to become a fetal image acquisition and analysis scientist acting as bridge between deep learning, MRI and clinical fetal-imaging applications to shift the boundaries of what is currently possible with state-of-the-art technology. Fulfilling the research aims will promote this, as it will result in a practical framework for automation and motion correction, applicable to a wide variety of fetal neuroimaging sequences. PROJECT NARRATIVE Subject motion is the fundamental impediment to reaping the full benefits of fetal-brain magnetic resonance imaging, as it frequently produces images with dramatic artifacts. The goal of this project is to exploit innovations in deep learning and integrate them into the acquisition pipeline to overcome the challenges posed by motion in fetal neuroimaging studies. This will be achieved by using fast, automated scan prescription of standard anatomical planes and by adaptively updating the acquisition as motion happens in the scanner, based on sub-second navigator scans interleaved with the imaging sequence.",Fast motion-robust fetal neuroimaging with MRI,9950474,K99HD101553,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Amniotic Fluid', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Calibration', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Radial', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'echo detection', 'experience', 'fetal', 'image archival system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'repaired', 'research study', 'response', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NICHD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K99,2020,108601,551214295,-0.007532777639545048
"High-definition, wide field of view corneal imaging The cornea is the primary focusing structure of our visual system. Infections and diseases in the tissue can impair vision and lead to blindness, even in eyes with intact neurosensory function. Corneal disease is one of the leading causes of visual deficiency and blindness in the world. Tissue evaluation is an important step for assessing the health of the donor cornea and its appropriateness for different types of placement, yet this process suffers from high subjectivity. High-definition corneal imaging is needed to assist in selection of the most appropriate tissue for transplant. Progress on this front would greatly serve public need, as the cornea is the most commonly transplanted tissue worldwide, with nearly 185,000 transplants annually. Thus, a more sensitive and quantitative method for objective evaluation of tissue at eye banks is needed. We have developed a 3D high-definition imaging instrument based on Gabor-Domain Optical Coherence Microscopy (GDOCM). Our SBIR Phase I research successfully accomplished all Aims and demonstrated the feasibility of quantitative assessment of corneal tissue over a large field of view with GDOCM. Our Phase I results demonstrated that GDOCM has the following key advantages over existing corneal imaging techniques, which include specular and confocal microscopy: 1) improved accuracy of tissue qualification with 4-10x increase in field of view that reduces sampling error – this will provides a truer assessment of the overall tissue characteristics; 2) ability to simultaneously measure corneal thickness, quantify endothelial cell density, and identify morphological variations due to corneal disease – this will lead to complete corneal evaluation in a single instrument; 3) leveraging machine learning innovations to minimize variability induced by users – this will result in a more objective evaluation; 4) enhanced 3D cellular-level imaging of thin translucent endothelial cells – this will enable a detailed understanding of cell viability. The results of the proposed Phase studies II will demonstrate that GDOCM can provide high-definition, 3D visualization of corneal structures with immediate commercial application for qualification of donor tissue in eye banks, and with a path to in vivo clinical imaging of patients with corneal disease. Current corneal evaluation methods employed at eye banks have limited field of view and/or insufficient resolution, and their results suffer from high subjectivity. We propose to commercialize a Gabor-domain optical coherence microscope to enable non-invasive, high-definition, wide field of view imaging in 3D for eye banks.","High-definition, wide field of view corneal imaging",10239347,R44EY028827,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Blindness', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Density', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell Viability Process', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye Banks', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Innovation Corps', 'International', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optics', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Patient imaging', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rights', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Errors', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissue Donors', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visual system structure', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinical imaging', 'commercial application', 'density', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo regeneration', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurosensory', 'novel', 'phase 2 study', 'programs', 'prototype', 'screening', 'three-dimensional visualization', 'tool', 'trend']",NEI,LIGHTOPTECH CORPORATION,R44,2020,178785,974517,-0.020193300386325084
"A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles In the United States, 2.8 million people every year seek medical attention for traumatic brain injury (TBI), of which 80% are considered to have a mild TBI (i.e. concussion). Even in those with mild injuries, 10-20% of individuals will suffer long-term disability including seizures and emotional and behavioral issues. One of the primary challenges in TBI care is appropriately classifying this heterogeneous injury and identifying patients at risk for these chronic impairments. Conventional imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), are commonly used to classify TBI, but do not reliably capture the full extent of the injury, particularly in those patients with mild injuries. Currently, there are few molecular markers to assist in the assessment of an individual's unique injury and subsequent recovery and biomarkers are desperately needed in the field that correlate with these varied endophenotypes, track the progress of the disease, and predict clinical outcomes. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a microchip-based platform that can be used to characterize TBI and its recovery using the RNA cargo found in brain-derived circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. Unlike prior work that has mainly focused on single biomarkers, our approach measures a panel of circulating EV miRNA markers processed with machine learning algorithms, to more comprehensively capture the state of the injured and recovering brain. Our proposal combines surface marker-specific nanomagnetic isolation of brain-derived EVs from a variety of cell types, biomarker discovery using RNA sequencing, and machine learning processing of EV miRNA cargo to measure the state of injury and recovery in TBI. Nanoscale exosomes are known to shed from brain cells into the blood stream, carrying with them the molecular signatures that can be used to better diagnose and treat injuries, such as traumatic brain injury. We propose an innovative, clinically practical approach to probe the RNA contained within these nanoscale vesicles to better understand a patient's injury and recovery to better guide treatment. Our rapid and easily multiplexed platform has great potential for non-invasive diagnostics and monitoring of both secondary injury progression and drug efficacy, offers tremendous benefits for patients.",A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles,10019696,R33MH118170,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Archives', 'Astrocytes', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Brain', 'Brain Concussion', 'Brain Edema', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Production', 'RNA', 'RNA Probes', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'drug efficacy', 'endophenotype', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'individual response', 'injured', 'injury and repair', 'injury recovery', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'machine learning algorithm', 'manufacturability', 'medical attention', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'microchip', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'nanomagnetic', 'nanoscale', 'neuropathology', 'next generation', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'nucleic acid detection', 'outcome forecast', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ratiometric', 'research clinical testing', 'response to injury', 'technology development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vascular injury']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R33,2020,191801,593605914,0.01469996728734747
"MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy parkinsonian type (MSA-P), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are costly and devastating neurodegenerative diseases. They have overlapping clinical manifestations and diagnosis remains challenging in many cases. Thus far no effective treatments have been developed to meaningfully slow or stop their progression. This is due in part to a lack of tools to objectively measure degeneration in the neural systems affected by each of these diseases. Availability of such tools would assist clinical diagnosis, facilitate selection of appropriate patient groups for trial recruitment, and enable objective measurement of treatment outcomes. Recent MRI studies suggest that disease-specific brain changes can, indeed, be identified in these parkinsonian diseases. The objective of this research is to identify univariable markers and multivariable MRI signatures that capture distinct patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to accurately distinguish these diseases.  To accomplish this the investigators use 3 Tesla MRI contrasts sensitive to key features of neurodegeneration to 1) identify structures damaged by PD, MSA-P and PSP and 2) to quantify the extent of damage in each neural system in parkinsonian diseases. Specifically, the investigators use neuromelanin- sensitive MRI to measure neuromelanin loss and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and R2* imaging to measure iron accumulation in patients with PD, MSA-P, and PSP. Using these contrasts and an innovative region of interest (ROI) selection approach, they reproducibly measure patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems. In Aim 1 the investigators use neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to study neuromelanin loss in PD, MSA-P and PSP in to identify univariable disease features that are differentially affected by parkinsonian diseases and may assist distinguishing these conditions. In Aim 2 they use QSM and R2* MRI to study ROIs differentially impacted by PD, MSA-P and PSP to identify iron accumulation biomarkers to help distinguish these diseases. In Aim 3 the investigators apply machine learning classification algorithms to identify multivariable MRI signatures of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to differentiate PD, MSA-P and PSP. Study outputs will be candidate MRI biomarkers and disease signatures. The long term goal of this research is to further develop these outputs for use as clinical diagnostic tools and as biomarkers for subject selection and outcome measurement in clinical trials.  Through this career award Dr. Huddleston will gain new skills in MRI methods, data science, and neural systems imaging in parkinsonian diseases. These new skills will enable Dr. Huddleston to design and lead interdisciplinary neuroimaging biomarker studies for Parkinson’s disease and related disorders. His mentor team is comprised of leaders in their fields. This team and the dynamic research environment at Emory University provide the necessary support for Dr. Huddleston to successfully transition to scientific independence. There is an urgent public health need for new treatments to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy, and objective tools to distinguish these diseases for clinical and research purposes are lacking. The outputs of the proposed research will be candidate MRI biomarkers and multivariable MRI signatures to differentiate these conditions. These candidate biomarkers may be developed for use in clinical trial designs to increase their odds of success, and they may also assist clinical diagnosis.",MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism,9999688,K23NS105944,"['Affect', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical assessments', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Iron', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple System Atrophy', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Progressive Supranuclear Palsy', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Red nucleus structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Subjects Selections', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning classifier', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromelanin', 'neuron loss', 'nigrostriatal system', 'novel', 'pars compacta', 'patient screening', 'putamen', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,192564,507546965,0.02828329405385704
"Neural-derived extracellular vesicles microRNAs in bipolar disorder: a peripheral window into the brain Project Summary/Abstract Bipolar disorder is a chronic and often severe psychiatric disorder with a strong genetic basis. However, even with significant progress made by molecular genetic studies, the few genetic variants associated with the disorder explain only a small portion of its heritability, which led to the hypothesis of the involvement of epigenetic alterations in BD’s pathophysiology. While recent studies have attempted to identify epigenetic biomarkers in BD, most results are limited due to the tissue specificity of epigenetic alterations and the biased assessments of candidate genes or genome-wide investigations through microarrays. Since the search for biomarkers have repetitively focused on peripheral measures that do not necessarily reflect brain alterations, significant biologically- and clinically-relevant findings have been significantly hindered. This study will fill this important gap by measuring epigenetic markers in plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by the brain. Specifically, we will focus on microRNAs and other non-coding RNAs that have been recently proposed to mediate important mechanisms in BD and may integrate gene and environment stimuli. Of note, microRNAs- filled EVs are released by the neural tissue as a method of cell-to-cell communication and may be the key players in transferring epigenetic markers to germ cells, ultimately contributing to the inter- and transgenerational transmission of BD. Our working hypothesis is that patients with BD will show alterations in specific miRNAs and other non-coding RNA transcripts in plasma neural-derived EVs compared to controls. To test this, we will initially identify neural-specific EVs microRNAs in BD by analyzing blood samples from 60 healthy controls and 60 BD type I patients (already collected and stored in our Department) (Aim 1). After neural-derived EVs immunoprecipitation and characterization, RNA will be isolated and next generation sequencing libraries will be prepared and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq instrument with 1x75 bp single-end reads at an approximate depth of 10-15 million reads per sample. Significantly altered miRNAs will be validated by real-time PCR and the putative biological relevance of the differentially expressed transcripts will be assessed by functional pathway analyses. In addition, a machine learning model will be built using the miRNA expression data in order to predict whether an individual sample belongs to the BD or control group, allowing for the establishment of a clinically useful predictive biosignature that can have immediate impact in the field. On a second step we will investigate the correlation between neuronal EVs transcriptome markers with clinical, neuroanatomical, and neurocognitive parameters available for each subject, with the ultimate goal of identifying the clinical relevance of the newly- identified EVs markers in endophenotypes of illness (Aim 2). The identification of such brain-specific markers will likely open new avenues for scientific investigation of BD. Public Health Relevance Statement The proposed research is relevant to public health because bipolar disorder is a chronic and highly disabling condition with a strong familial aggregation, yet non-genetic mechanisms (such as microRNAs) underlying the disorder are still fairly unknown. The investigation of plasma neural-derived extracellular vesicles in bipolar disorder patients and controls and the development of a machine learning algorithm for the identification of a microRNA biosignature can lead to the identification of clinically relevant peripherally measured brain-specific biomarkers that can improve our understanding of the disorder and inform the development of personalized treatments.",Neural-derived extracellular vesicles microRNAs in bipolar disorder: a peripheral window into the brain,9973236,R21MH117636,"['Affect', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edetic Acid', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'First Degree Relative', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Germ Cells', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Multivesicular Body', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'biosignature', 'candidate marker', 'clinically relevant', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'endophenotype', 'epigenetic marker', 'extracellular vesicles', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'intercellular communication', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'milliliter', 'next generation sequencing', 'non-genetic', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'severe psychiatric disorder', 'specific biomarkers', 'transcriptome', 'transmission process', 'vesicular release', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2020,194584,135644722,-0.001273280156866814
"Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery Recent years have seen rapid growth in the availability of large, complex functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets of the human brain. However, the potential of this fMRI Big Data is presently limited by our understanding of the neural sources that contribute to fMRI signals. Fluctuations in arousal (i.e., in the level wakefulness and alertness) are known to modulate cognitive and behavioral processes and to display prominent alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders. Yet, since the vast majority of fMRI datasets lack neurophysiological or behavioral indices of arousal, fMRI Big Data cannot be readily harnessed to understand human brain arousal in health and disease. Recent data-driven approaches attempt to fill this gap but have limitations. The overall goal of this proposal is to increase the transformative potential of fMRI Big Data for human neuroscience through a novel analytic framework for detecting arousal fluctuations from fMRI data alone. We will accomplish this goal by developing and disseminating tools for modeling arousal fluctuations based on powerful statistical learning methods (Specific Aim 1). We will apply these models to large fMRI databases of healthy aging and Alzheimer’s Disease, both of which are associated with altered arousal (Specific Aims 2 and 3). We will capitalize on these databases to determine how knowledge of brain arousal fluctuations improves neuroimaging biomarkers of aging- and neurodegenerative disease-related changes in human brain function, and the extent to which arousal itself constitutes an informative biomarker of these states. This research would, moreover, increase the reliability and translational potential of fMRI studies more broadly by providing the ability to account for these major neural (arousal) state changes. These immediate research goals form a strong bridge with my long-term research objective of understanding principles of brain function by developing and innovatively adapting methods for the analysis of large and complex neuroimaging datasets. This objective is enabled by the mentored training plan, where I will (i) develop expertise in cutting-edge machine learning techniques and (ii) apply these techniques to multimodal neuroimaging data. The two co-mentors have complementary expertise that align, respectively, with these two training components. Aims 1 and 2 will span the mentored phase and part of the independent phase, while Aim 3 (application to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data) will be performed in the independent phase. The mentored environment of the NIH Intramural Research Program provides the resources for all planned data acquisition, as well as a rich community of neuroscience investigators and seminars. Interaction with the extramural (Columbia University) co-mentor will occur through frequent video conferences and several visits, with opportunities to engage with the Columbia data science community. Developing models of brain arousal fluctuations in fMRI data would contribute to our understanding of arousal mechanisms and its alteration with a variety of brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease.

"Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations TOWARD A HIGH DIMENSIONAL COMPUTATIONAL DESCRIPTION OF VARIATION IN HUMAN DECISION-MAKING ACROSS PSYCHIATRIC AND NON-PSYCHIATRIC POPULATIONS PI: Dr. John P. O'Doherty Institution: California Institute of Technology PROJECT SUMMARY  Computational psychiatry (CP) promises to gain deeper explanatory insight into psychiatric disorders through the application of formal computational models to task-related behavioral data and brain measures. However, research in CP to date has mostly involved a narrow unidimensional focus, utilizing either a relatively limited set of computational constructs such as simple model-free (MF) reinforcement learning (RL), and/or restricted to studying a specific task, a specific disease, or even a particular model parameter. For CP to reach its potential, we need to broaden the field's scope. To achieve this, it is necessary to develop an integrated theory and formal framework supported by a task battery that will enable the quantification of individual differences across a range of computational mechanisms pertinent to the diagnosis and treatment of clinical disorders. The objective of the current proposal is to implement the initial groundwork needed to build and test a computational framework and task battery that can facilitate a multi-dimensional computational description of individual variability in parameters relevant for characterizing psychiatric dysfunction.  We have constructed a computational assessment battery (CAB) consisting of four distinct yet inter- related tasks that move beyond simple RL to probe various aspects of learning, cognition, and decision-making. First, we assess learning about losses as well as rewards. Secondly, we measure model-based (MB) alongside simple MF learning and decision making, and the arbitration allocating control to either strategy. Thirdly, we examine strategies for solving the exploration/exploitation dilemma, in which individuals have to decide whether to exploit an option known to yield reward or explore an option whose outcomes are unknown. Finally, we assess social-learning, in which an individual can either infer the goals of another individual or simply imitate that agent's behavior.  We propose to build an integrated computational model that can capture relevant computations being implemented in each of the tasks in our battery, alongside a hierarchical model-fitting and parameter estimation framework to enable us to retrieve reliable parameter estimates for each computational variable of interest. We will leverage common computational mechanisms engaged across our task battery to improve estimability and generalizability. We will then acquire behavioral data in a large on-line (n=1000), and modest (n=100) in-lab sample on the CAB to establish the internal validity and test/re-test reliability of our computational model and parameter estimates. Finally, we will explore the relationship between model-estimated parameter estimates from behavior on our task battery and variability in self-reported traits and states relevant for psychiatric disease in our healthy samples, as well as in a pilot sample (n=60) of patients recruited from the UCLA psychiatry outpatient clinics. These efforts will form the basis of a Computational Psychiatry Toolbox for behavioral testing, model-fitting and parameter estimation that will eventually be released as a resource to the research community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop a comprehensive approach to characterize an individual's ability to think, learn and make decisions in terms of a series of specific brain processes or `computations'. We then aim to determine whether variation in these computations can in turn be related to a variety of symptoms that can occur in psychiatric disorders. To achieve this, we will develop new mathematical and experimental tools to assess variation in behavior across individuals, and refine, test and validate these tools in a preliminary sample of healthy participants and psychiatric patients.",Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations,9989897,R21MH120805,"['Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Anxiety', 'Arbitration', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Functional disorder', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Undifferentiated', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large scale simulation', 'recruit', 'social learning', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2020,204080,81181560,0.006003536042589021
"Imaging Mass Spectrometry for metabolome mapping SUMMARY In response to NOT-GM-20-013, we are requesting a supplement to our R01 5R01GM120033-04 for an MALDI imaging source unit to be attached to an existing Q ExactiveMass Spectrometer (Ultra-High Mass Range Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap™) for spatial mapping of metabolites in thin tissue sections. Within our R01 award, to analyze NMR metabolome data we are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on recent developments in machine learning. We have coded these algorithms and tested their sensitivity and specificity on both synthesized and real data. We then applied these methods to human disease models and identified putative biomarkers. To validate these biomarkers, we have developed methods to analyze animal tissues and human brain organoids using imaging mass spectrometry (IMS), which permits spatial localization of metabolites without labeling. This targeted IMS metabolic phenotyping approach complements our untargeted NMR methods: it allows us to determine whether the individual metabolites identified by NMR represent bona fide biomarkers and to develop metabolic hypotheses for their association with disease. We submit this request for imaging mass spectrometer hardware because a nearby IMS facility on which we have relied has closed and no other IMS facility exists in greater Houston area. Performing the IMS studies ourselves, with the help of collaborators, will accelerate our discovery about the role small molecules and metabolites play in health and disease. This instrument will help us better i) perform metabolome screens to identify the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on neural cell types in human brain organoid models; ii) perform high-throughput drug screening to stimulate neural stem cells to produce new neurons in the brain organoid models to regenerate damaged tissue; and iii) use our NMR algorithms to develop a protocol for quantitative imaging. None of these studies will be possible without the imaging mass spectrometer. Given our access to state-of-the-art equipment, data-collection expertise, and new analytical algorithms that are especially sensitive and specific to NMR spectral data, we are uniquely positioned to advance biomarker and diagnostics tools and screening methods for metabolites and synthetic small molecules. Using an imaging mass spectrometer to map metabolite distribution may help us discover diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers not only for SARS-CoV-2, but for a broad spectrum of brain disorders that lead to neurodegeneration. Such broad usage of our platform would be transformative for neuroscientists, neurologists, and their patients. NARRATIVE The metabolome is a dynamic and sensitive biological system that reflects both innate processes and environmental influences, and can therefore tell us much about an organism's health and homeostasis. In our R01, we are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms to analyze NMR metabolome data.

"Enabling Kinematic Joint Profiling Using MRI Project Summary We propose a technical feasibility study seeking to develop methods for quantitative kinematic proﬁling of moving joints using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the context of this study, a kinematic proﬁle is deﬁned as a collection of joint characteristics computed and tracked during the course of movement. This project is motivated by the hypothesis that such proﬁling of moving joints can highlight dysfunction, treatment progress, and point towards favorable (or unfavorable) surgical interventions. At a high level, it is envisioned that the proposed kinematic proﬁles could ﬁt into clinical management workﬂows much in the same way as blood biomarker panels.  While kinematic imaging of joints can be performed using plain-ﬁlm (PF) X-ray, computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound (US) methods, MRI is the gold-standard for advanced orthopedic assessment and is an appealing option for accessory kinematic analysis. A set of relatively fast kinematic proﬁling acquisitions could feasibly be added to routine orthopedic MRI exams, thereby providing optimal diagnostic imaging in both static and kinematic contexts within a single visit.  Though several preliminary studies have hinted at the potential diagnostic value of kinematic imaging data, such data is difﬁcult to interpret and cannot easily be quantiﬁed or captured in clinical records. In this study, we seek to establish fundamental methods that can provide simple and easily digestible kinematic imaging reports with data acquired in a short scan interval using conventional clinical MRI equipment.  As a preliminary feasibility investigation of these methods, kinematic imaging of the wrist will be studied. Dysfunction of the scaphoid and lunate bones in the wrist is a well-studied kinematic problem of diagnostic signiﬁcance. Novel 4D zero-echo-time MRI of the wrist will be used to capture the kinematic imaging using for proﬁling of the scaphoid-lunate mechanics during two established wrist movement patterns.  The goal of this project is to establish and demonstrate methodological components required for MRI kinematic proﬁling. Data collection on a modest-sized cohort of 100 healthy control subjects is proposed for this purpose. Novel MRI pulse-sequence and post-processing development components are introduced and tasked for analysis of this normative data. Using the acquired MRI data, kinematic parameters for each dynamic dataset will be extracted and curated into a multi-parametric proﬁle for each subject.  Aim 2 of the study proposes the use of external sensor motion capture methods to validate the MRI-based kinematic parameter measurements on 50% of the study cohort.  Finally, Aim 3 of the study seeks to use machine-learning clustering approaches to develop a kinematic proﬁle normalization procedure using the acquired control dataset. Such normalization is a crucial milestone in the translation of kinematic proﬁling to the clinic and will establish a baseline for future translational studies of symptomatic cohorts. Project Narrative We seek to develop and demonstrate fundamental methods in quantitative kinematic proﬁling using clinical diagnostic imaging equipment. This technical development project is constructed under the hypothesis that such proﬁling of moving joints can highlight dysfunction, treatment progress, and point towards favorable (or unfavorable) surgical interventions.

"Accurate quantification of kidney function with non-sedated motion-compensated pediatric MRI Project Summary: Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is an impairment of urine flow from the renal pelvis into the proximal ureter and is the most common cause of hydronephrosis in neonates. This disorder is detected in up to 7% of all maternal ultrasound scans, and an estimated 10% of these newborns have hydronephrosis, which, if left untreated, may result in early failure of functional renal development in these patients. Current methods of assessing kidney function in neonates and children are less than optimal, however. While the current reference standard, nuclear renography (MAG3), yields some useful diagnostic information; it is invasive, slow, provides low resolution, does not offer anatomic detail, and delivers potentially harmful ionizing radiation. Thus, there is an urgent, unmet need to develop a method for functional imaging of kidneys that is non-invasive, safe, accurate, reproducible and radiation-free. The primary objective of this exploratory, two-year study, therefore, is two-fold: first, to develop advanced methods of motion-compensated, high spatial and temporal resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the improved quantification of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), an important marker of renal function; and second, to demonstrate the superiority of this method over the current reference standard, nuclear renography (MAG3). Our application in response to PAR-18-743 is specifically aimed at developing, and evaluating motion-robust, high spatiotemporal resolution dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) for quantifying GFR (MR-GFR) as well as creating new automated analysis software to enable the robust and reproducible assessment of differential renal function in newborns eliminating need for sedation, and in older children. Our method will overcome the technical challenges of current DCE-MRI techniques providing high temporal resolution to capture fast arterial input function dynamics required for accurate computation of GFR, compensate for unavoidable respiratory and bulk motion to reconstruct high quality images and will provide robust, fast, automated post processing techniques for accurate GFR computation. As a non-invasive, motion-robust, radiation-free imaging technique that can depict renal structures at much higher resolution, MR-GFR will offer, for the first time, a level of diagnostic information that is unattainable with MAG3. The critical importance of understanding the extent and severity of UPJO (and resulting hydronephrosis) cannot be understated; for in the absence of this information, children who stand to benefit from immediate surgery might be overlooked or delayed in receiving treatment; and those who might benefit from a more conservative approach (i.e., watching waiting) might receive an unnecessary surgical intervention. Indeed, this novel imaging approach is expected to substantially improve clinical decision-making. The successful completion of our aims will enable 1) assessment of renal function accurately; 2) predicting the likelihood of functional decline; and 3) determining whether surgery is indicated. DCE-MRI is expected to have rapid translational impact for several diseases effecting kidney function once it is introduced into clinical practice. Project Narrative: This project addresses the need to develop advanced methods of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess kidney function in newborns and in older children who have been diagnosed with ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO), an impairment of urine flow that is the most common cause of hydronephrosis (inability to void urine). Unfortunately, severe hydronephrosis, left untreated, can result in permanent damage to the child's kidneys and our novel method of assessing kidney function, dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), promises to evaluate the extent of this disorder in a way that is highly accurate, non- invasive, safe, reliable, and radiation-free and will eliminate the need of repeated scans, sedation and anesthesia when imaging newborns with congenital hydronephrosis. Most importantly, this approach will enable the clinician to confidently and quickly refer children for corrective surgery based on imaging results; and likewise, recommend other children for more conservative “watchful-waiting”, effectively reducing the number of unnecessary surgeries.",Accurate quantification of kidney function with non-sedated motion-compensated pediatric MRI,9877232,R21DK123569,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age-Months', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drainage procedure', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Free Will', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gadolinium', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Hospitalization', 'Hydronephrosis', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Infection', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Function Tests', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Liquid substance', 'Lower urinary tract', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Nephrectomy', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nuclear', 'Obstruction', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pain', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Pentetic Acid', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Reference Standards', 'Renal function', 'Renal pelvis', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sedation procedure', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Ultrasonography', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Ureter', 'Ureteropelvic junction obstruction', 'Urine', 'Urology', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated algorithm', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bulk motion', 'care costs', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep neural network', 'functional decline', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kidney imaging', 'kinetic model', 'neonate', 'neural network algorithm', 'novel', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'renal artery', 'respiratory', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement', 'translational impact', 'urologic']",NIDDK,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2020,221250,209484975,-0.010298999764621841
"Image-guided robot for high-throughput microinjection of Drosophila embryos PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is submitted in response to the NIH Development of Animal Models and Related Biological Materials for Research (R21) program. The proposal develops an image-guided robotic platform that performs the automated delivery of molecular genetic tools and non-genetically encoded reagents such as chemical libraries, fluorescent dyes to monitor cellular processes, functionalized magnetic beads, or nanoparticles into thousands of Drosophila embryos in a single experimental session. The proposed work builds on recent engineering innovations in our collaborative group which has developed image-guided robotic systems that can precisely interface with single cells in intact tissue. The two Specific Aims provide for a systematic development of the proposed technologies. AIM 1 first engineers a robotic platform (‘Autoinjector’) that can scan and image Drosophila embryos in arrays of egg laying plates. We will utilize machine learning algorithms for automated detection of embryos, followed by thresholding and morphology analysis to detect embryo centroids and annotate injection sites. In AIM 2, we will utilize microprocessor-controlled fluidic circuits for programmatic delivery of femtoliter to nanoliter volumes of reagents into individual embryos. We will quantify the efficacy of the Autoinjector by comparing the survival, fertility, and transformation rates of transposon or PhiC31-mediated transgenesis to manual microinjection datasets. Finally, we will demonstrate the efficient delivery of sgRNAs and mutagenesis in the presence of Cas9. This project fits very well within the goals of the program by engineering a novel tool for producing and improving animal models. The Autoinjector will accelerate Drosophila research and empower scientists to perform novel experiments and genome-scale functional genomics screens that are currently too inefficient or labor intensive to be conducted on a large scale and may additionally enable other novel future applications.

"Environment, Metabolomics, and PD Project Abstract Our PEG study is among the largest Parkinson's disease (PD) population-based study with exceptional high-quality disease characterization and in-depth exposure assessment. Patients are diagnosed and examined (multiple times) by a UCLA movement disorder specialist. We developed a longitudinal geographic information system (GIS) based assessment for pesticide exposures that links state-mandated information on type, date, and location of all agricultural pesticide applications in California recorded since 1974 to land use maps and study participants' residences and work places. Here we propose to combine a powerful new metabolomics tool and system biology analytic methods to identify signatures for toxic exposures that evoke long-term biologic responses. The metabolomics data we will generate will help us identify metabolic profiles for chronic environmental exposures for both PD patients and population controls. This will generate a first understanding of the metabolic consequences of chronic low dose pesticide exposure in PD. However, biologic processes, including biologic responses to chronic toxicant exposures and those involved in disease development, are highly dynamic and interactive systems. The PEG study is uniquely capable to begin investigating these multidimensional networks linking exposure and disease. We have already generated genome and epigenome profiles for 550 PD patients and 250 controls. Here we newly propose to generate and analyze serum based metabolome profiles (targeted and untargeted) for these same 800 study participants characterizing environmental pesticide exposures via metabolome wide association analyses. We aim to develop a metabolite signature of environmental exposure using supervised machine learning methods, and also determine if these are disease specific or found in both exposed cases and controls. Furthermore, incorporating our genome and epigenome information, we propose to use biological systems analysis to identify multi-omics network patterns that distinguish environmental exposures that contribute to PD onset and progression. We expect this to show a chronic response pattern across different molecular layers and are influenced by many environmental factors. Combining multi-omic measures based on multidimensional network and system analyses will address the gaps in our current knowledge concerning molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects of chronic low dose exposures in PD. Project Narrative Here we propose to build upon a unique resource - the PEG population-based Parkinson's disease (PD) study - to identify metabolic signatures of chronic environmental exposures and disease in 550 PD patients and 250 population controls. Importantly, we plan to integrate exposure and effect markers across multiple molecular layers (genome, epigenome, metabolome), with the goal to obtain a more holistic understanding of molecular changes due to chronic environmental exposures. Our approach incorporates multi-omics measures and multidimensional network and system analyses to address gaps in our current knowledge concerning molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects of chronic low dose exposures in PD.","Environment, Metabolomics, and PD",9858332,R21ES030175,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Anions', 'Archives', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biometry', 'Caffeine', 'California', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatography', 'Chronic', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier Transform', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Onset of illness', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pesticides', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Population Study', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Policy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specialist', 'Structure of molecular layer of cerebellar cortex', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'agricultural pesticide', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biological systems', 'brain health', 'case control', 'cell type', 'disorder control', 'disorder risk', 'environmental pesticide exposure', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'land use', 'machine learning method', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'patient population', 'pesticide exposure', 'population based', 'residence', 'response', 'screening', 'supervised learning', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2020,234000,673201228,0.009624046276925211
"GAZE AND THE VISUAL CONTROL OF FOOT PLACEMENT WHEN WALKING OVER ROUGH TERRAIN PROJECT SUMMARY & ABSTRACT  Human locomotion through natural environments requires the coordination of all levels of the sensorimotor hierarchy, from the cortical areas involved in processing of visual information and high level planning to the subcortical and spinal structures involved in the regulation of the gait and posture. However, despite the complex neural bases of human locomotion, the output is highly regular and well organized around the basic physical dynamics and biomechanics that define the stability and energetic costs of moving a bipedal body through space. There is a rich and growing body of literature describing detailed knowledge each of the individual components of human locomotion, including neural mechanisms, muscular neuromechanics, and biomechanics. However, very little research exists on the way that visual input is used to dynamically control locomotion, and the overall control structure of the integrated neural and mechanical system during natural locomotion through a complex and dynamic world. This lack of integrative research not only restricts the breadth of impact of research from these individual disciplines, but also limits our ability to develop adequate treatment plans for loss of locomotor ability deriving from systems-level factors such as aging, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease. In order to to fill this critical gap in our knowledge about human locomotion, it is necessary to develop an integrated research program that examines the interactions between the visual, neural, and mechanical bases of human movement through the world. In service of this general goal, this proposal outlines research projects aimed at specific unanswered questions about locomotion over different terrains. This proposal comprises three specific research and training aims on the visual control of locomotion over rough terrain. Aim 1 focuses on the behavioral task itself, Aim 2 investigates the sensory stimulus experienced during real-world locomotion, and Aim 3 examines the motor integration of visually specified goals into the ongoing gait cycle. Aim 1 investigates effects of changing environmental uncertainty and task demands on gaze allocation strategies during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 2 analyzes and models the visual stimulus experienced during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 3 determines how visually specified target footholds and targets are integrated into the ongoing preferred steady-state gait. Together these aims will significantly advance our understanding of how humans use vision to control their movement through the natural world, which greatly increase our ability to develop clinical diagnosis and treatment for loss of locomotor function. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Very little research exists on the way that visual input is used to dynamically control locomotion, and the overall control structure of the integrated neural and mechanical system during natural locomotion. This lack of integrative research limits our ability to develop adequate treatment plans for loss of locomotor ability deriving from systems-level factors such as aging, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease. In order to fill this critical gap in our knowledge about human locomotion, this proposal develops an integrated research program that examines the interactions between the visual, neural, and mechanical bases of human movement through the world.",GAZE AND THE VISUAL CONTROL OF FOOT PLACEMENT WHEN WALKING OVER ROUGH TERRAIN,10019556,R00EY028229,"['3-Dimensional', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Locomotion', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Nature', 'Neuromechanics', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Posture', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Uncertainty', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'area MST', 'area MT', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cost', 'design', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'foot', 'gaze', 'insight', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuromechanism', 'neuromuscular', 'novel', 'optic flow', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'skills', 'statistics', 'treadmill', 'treatment planning', 'visual control', 'visual information', 'visual processing', 'visual stimulus', 'visual-motor integration']",NEI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R00,2020,243713,38247784,-0.013315040417635817
"High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is in response to PA 18-484. In the BRAIN 2025 Report, PET (positron emission tomography) is identified as “the best means to translate studies of neurotransmitters, receptors, and neuromodulators to humans.” However dynamic assessment of receptor occupancy and metabolism is hindered by the spatial resolution and sensitivity of even the most modern of clinically available PET scanners. To address this challenge, we propose a next generation PET detector with a highly innovative design: a detector module with a layered scintillator structure and a side readout configuration. The crystal slabs in the module are stacked along the depth direction and are optically separated by reflective films. The scintillation light created in each layer is measured by photodetectors located on the four sides of the crystal. Compared with traditional PET detectors, which contain pixelated crystal arrays, the new design has the following advantages: (1) The layered structure provides depth of interaction (DOI) information such that a smaller diameter detector ring can be used without increasing parallax error, increasing sensitivity while lowering costs. (2) The four-sided readout method improves the energy resolution of the system with increased scintillation light collection efficiency by reducing light loss due to total internal reflection. (3) Sub millimeter spatial resolution is achievable without using very small pitch crystal arrays, since the interaction location in each crystal layer is determined via machine learning- based decoding of the light distribution collected on the four crystal sides. Therefore the production cost of the crystals is reduced. (4) Since the interaction location and energy resolution for each layer are determined independently, the system sensitivity can be increased by stacking more layers in the module without affecting the spatial and energy resolution of the system. (5) For side readout setup, a larger ratio of cross-sectional area to length requires fewer photodetectors to cover all four sides of the module; this reduces photodetector cost. The first four points above have been demonstrated in preliminary studies using a small, prototype module. We propose to build a large scale detector module with this new design to verify the fifth advantage, and to study the effect of detector size on the first four. The outcome of this proposal will be two DOI enabled detector modules with excellent spatial resolution (~1 mm) and energy resolution (~10%), as well as good timing resolution (~400 ps), and DOI resolution (~ 3 mm) and high system sensitivity. A full characterization study for the two modules and imaging studies for both the Derenzo and Hoffman brain phantoms will address the current limitations of human brain PET scanners, and will serve as the foundation for a new dynamic PET scanner for neuroimaging. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop a novel design for detector modules used in brain-dedicated PET system with good spatial resolution, energy resolution, timing resolution, and DOI resolution, as well as high sensitivity. If successful, the study will pave the way for building a novel PET system for greatly improved dynamic PET imaging of the human brain.",High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging,10017238,R01EB028337,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Crystallization', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Film', 'Foundations', 'Gamma Rays', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurotransmitter Receptor', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Portugal', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Production', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rod', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Thinness', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'base', 'brain size', 'cost', 'design', 'detector', 'human imaging', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'millimeter', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'photomultiplier', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'response']",NIBIB,"CANON MEDICAL RESEARCH USA, INC.",R01,2020,243919,243919,0.008485487453061994
"Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers Project Summary Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) has been proposed as a technique to quantify tissue parameters, such as T1 and T2 relaxation times, which are biomarkers for various pathologies. One assumption of MRF is that the signal in each voxel is generated by exactly one set of tissue parameters. Due to MRI resolution at the range of millimeter in combination with the cellular structure of biological tissue, each voxel consists of multiple tissue compartments. An over-simplified single compartment model results in apparent relaxation times that are influenced by the relaxation times and the fractional proton densities of all contributing compartments. This can lead to a misinterpretation of signal changes. For example, in diseases that causes demyelination in white matter (Multiple Sclerosis, Dementia), a reduction of the myelin water fraction would result in a misleading change of the apparent relaxation time of the voxel. We propose a multi-compartment MRF method that allows to identify multiple tissue contributions within a voxel, including the fractional proton density (PD) of different compartments. Our machine learning based approach automatically identifies the number of compartments within each voxel that can be identified with the available SNR in that voxel. We will correct for partial-volume effects at the borders of two types of tissues, as well as analyze tissue microstructure. For the second case our learned model will also include chemical exchange between compartments. After an initial validation phase using numerical simulations, we will first perform MRF scans of dedicated 3D printed phantoms with multiple compartments. Our quality criterion is successful estimation of all simulated tissue compartments for all voxels with a relative error of less than 5% to the ground truth. We will then perform in-vivo MRF measurements of healthy volunteers (n=5). We will generate synthetic FLAIR and MP-RAGE contrasts from parameter maps estimated with conventional and the proposed multi-compartment MRF technique. We will compare them with currently used clinical contrasts acquired using established pulse sequences and validate the performance of our approach by measuring the cortical thickness. Further, we will validate the performance for microstructure composition in white matter. Our hypothesis is that it will be possible separate the compartments for myelin, intra- and extra-cellular water and compare the results to ex-vivo data found in literature. In summary, the methods developed in this R21 proposal will provide a novel technique to accurately and reproducibly identify biomarkers beyond the resolution of a voxel. It will allow to identify changes in tissue composition and fractional proton density at the microstructure level. Project Narrative The overarching goal of this proposal is to establish a MR imaging technique for quantifying biomarkers at the sub-voxel level. We will develop a machine learning based MR fingerprinting image reconstruction that enables the identification and characterization of multiple compartments within a voxel in terms of fractional proton density and relaxation times. We will generate accurate synthetic fluid suppressed images such as the FLAIR and MP- RAGE with accurate partial volume behavior and analyze the myelin water fraction and the corresponding relaxation times in white matter.",Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers,10016296,R21EB027241,"['3D Print', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Demyelinations', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Fingerprint', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Protons', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Water', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'gray matter', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'millimeter', 'neuroimaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'physical process', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'tissue biomarkers', 'white matter']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2020,252175,329565273,-0.007086067893238896
"Neurosurgical Planning with Robust Eloquent area Delineation from Individualized Connectivity-based Techniques (NeuroPREDICT) Project Summary/Abstract  The idiosyncrasies of the human brain require that individualized mapping of functional regions be performed before surgical interventions for cancer or epilepsy. The success of this mapping procedure has direct effects on surgical outcomes and preserving cognitive and sensory function post-surgery. Current gold standard procedures for pre-surgical mapping are invasive, time-consuming, and technically demanding. Several non-invasive procedures have emerged in recent years; however, they have not yet displaced the gold standard procedures. Task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (t-fMRI), the most widely used non-invasive pre-surgical mapping technique, requires that patients perform cognitive or motor tasks while in the scanner—a time-consuming and expensive procedure. Also, not all patients can perform fMRI tasks due to language barriers, sensory deficits, being unconscious, etc. Connectome Fingerprinting (CF) is a recently developed technique that uses machine learning to train a model capable of predicting functional brain activation from task-free resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). Once trained on a set of t-fMRI and rs- fMRI data, an unseen subject's unique pattern of brain activation can be predicted using only an rs-fMRI scan of their brain—therefore eliminating the need to perform tasks during the fMRI scan. Despite the promise of CF, the accuracy of the current best practice modeling techniques is not high enough yet to be clinically useful and studies applying CF have nearly always used healthy populations. Much research remains to be done to increase the accuracy of CF models before they can be deployed for pre-surgical mapping.  The long-term objective of the research proposed here is to develop a software application that combines applied machine learning with medical imaging to provide a non-invasive means for mapping the brains of neurosurgical patients before surgery. Importantly, we aim to increase the accuracy of CF modeling by expanding the modeling efforts to probabilistic Bayesian approaches that leverage prior information from the structure of the data. We will test a wide array of tunable data and model parameters to arrive at a current recommendation for best practices in CF research and applications. Finally, we will test our modeling procedures with a dataset of healthy control and pre-surgical patients diagnosed with brain tumors. We will test the software's ability to accurately predict functional brain organization in these patients and adaptively retrain the models to produce the most accurate results. This work has the potential to revolutionize pre-surgical brain mapping and expand its applicability to a greater number of patients. Project Narrative  In the United States, approximately 24,000 new cases of brain tumors are reported each year, with many patients requiring expensive pre-surgical planning and mapping of functional regions to minimize post-surgical impairments. In many neurosurgical practices [96% per 1], this involves performing a time-consuming and costly task-based fMRI acquisitions (nearly $1200/scan in 2014; [2]) before surgery to identify eloquent brain areas recruited for motor control, language, and cognition that must be spared during surgery. By combing task-based fMRI, resting-state fMRI and advanced machine learning to map the functional topology of the brain, the proposed technology will lower pre-surgical planning costs, reduce the burden on physicians and technicians, and expand pre-surgical mapping to previously excluded patients who cannot perform fMRI tasks.",Neurosurgical Planning with Robust Eloquent area Delineation from Individualized Connectivity-based Techniques (NeuroPREDICT),10139299,R43NS117226,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comb animal structure', 'Computer software', 'Conscious', 'Consumption', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Fingerprint', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Government', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Sensory', 'Software Engineering', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unconscious State', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Woman', 'Work', 'anatomic imaging', 'base', 'cognitive task', 'compliance behavior', 'computerized data processing', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data quality', 'design', 'functional MRI scan', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'large scale data', 'motor control', 'multisensory', 'next generation', 'preservation', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'structured data', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'usability']",NINDS,"CHARLES RIVER ANALYTICS, INC.",R43,2020,252569,1462117,0.008811827821523344
"Role of Epigenetically Active  Environmental Compounds in Neurodevelopmental Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), are increasingly recognized as originating from dysregulation of early brain development, which represents a window of vulnerability to environmental compounds. Environmental compounds may alter neurodevelopment via epigenetic mechanisms, which may not induce massive cell death, but change the brain function through their epigenetic effect on stem cell fate and lineage development. However, tools to systematically examine the epigenetic impact of environment on neurodevelopment are lacking. Here we employ Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscape (MIEL) to screen ToxCast Phase III chemical library (4700 compounds) and to characterize hits that alter epigenetic landscape of human neural precursors without inducing cytotoxicity. Recognizing environmental insults and understanding their mechanism of action will enable the development of regulations and guidelines aimed at avoiding such insults and the development of antidotes and protective agents when exposure is unavoidable. PROJECT NARRATIVE We developed a novel technique rooted in analysis of the epigenome topography at the single-cell level.

"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these challenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymorphisms, whole brain neuroimaging, biofluids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mechanisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Specifically, in Aim 1, we develop efficient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation models to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efficiency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-specific substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic systems through ordinary differential equations with random inflections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker profiles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efficient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individualized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest benefit from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art analytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research community. Project Narrative:  The ultimate goal of neuropsychiatric research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay disease on- set, slow disease progression, and provide effective treatment at each stage of disease. This proposal aims to develop new statistical approaches to integrate complementary sources of information from genomic measures, brain imaging biomarkers, and early clinical signs to characterize disease mechanism, progression, and treatment responses, and thereby inform the design of clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies.",Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures,9927686,R01NS073671,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hazard Models', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning method', 'minimal risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'statistical learning', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,340025,558628098,-0.015819407241280368
"Quantitative MR Imaging of Vascular Factors in Parkinsons Disease Abstract Vascular health has been shown to be an important factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Hence, the ability to measure reliably and quantitatively early hemodynamic changes in the aging brain can be a powerful tool for diagnosing, studying, and developing treatments. Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging can yield quantitative perfusion images without the use of contrast agents. We propose that combining new ASL techniques, such as Velocity Selective Inversion (VSI) labeling pulses and magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) with deep learning regression methods will allow quantification of multiple hemodynamic parameters beyond perfusion, thus providing a much more nuanced picture of the state of the vasculature. We also expect that the new technique will offer dramatic improvements in SNR, specificity and sensitivity of ASL, and that the proposed techniques will have many other applications in research and in the clinic. We propose to use these techniques to fill the knowledge gap regarding the relationship between vascular changes and Parkinson’s disease and its symptoms, particularly fatigue, whose pathogenesis is not well understood. If we are successful in this application, future work will use the hemodynamic parameters of interest as biomarkers to assess risk of neurodegeneration, determine therapeutic targets, and guide in the development of new therapies. Public Health Statement Vascular health is an important factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases We propose to develop a method that can produce quantifiable images of multiple blood flow related parameters with a single scan and without the use of contrast injections.

"Analysis of Nonstationary Point Process Data SUMMARY Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as a spike train, comes from an individual neuron. Another, the local field potential (LFP), is based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. For both kinds of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationarity. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities, but they also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. To provide the most useful information for designing novel therapies it is important to characterize the interactions among different parts of the brain, and the timing of these interactions relative to behavior. The research in this grant aims to develop methods for analyzing the ways that a network of brain areas may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior. This involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales: slower timescales can provide insight into states of the brain, such as the extent to which a subject is paying attention to a task; fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional continuous time series (for LFPs) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike trains). NARRATIVE Much mental health research relies on measurements of brain activity across different parts of the brain, and often poses difficult problems in statistical analysis. The research supported by this grant develops new methods of analyzing brain signals as they evolve across time. Of special interest is the way networks of interacting brain components may change under varying conditions.",Analysis of Nonstationary Point Process Data,10050798,R01MH064537,"['Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Group Structure', 'ImProv', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Structure', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'interest', 'network dysfunction', 'neural model', 'neural network', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'tool', 'vector']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,373940,30434536,0.011444863352838279
"The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning - Project Summary. This project explores how humans learn at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this supports human intelligence. Human decisions are typically hierarchically structured: we make high-level decisions (making a cup of coffee), which constrain lower level decisions (grinding coffee beans, boiling water, etc.), which themselves constrain simpler and simpler decisions and motor actions. This hierarchy in decisions is paralleled by a hierarchy in our representation of our environment: some sensory signals trigger simple decisions (a red light signals a stop), while other signal a broader, more abstract behavioral change (rain signals a set of adaptations when driving). Thus, complex hierarchical structure underlies the way we respond to our environment in seemingly simple, everyday tasks. This ability is supported by the prefrontal cortex, which represents states and decisions at multiple degrees of hierarchical abstraction. My previous work shows that hierarchical representations support transfer and generalization while learning, an ability that artificial agents still struggle to match human performance in. However, how we learn to form these hierarchical representations is poorly understood, despite how crucial it is for human intelligence. The proposed work will examine how multiple, parallel hierarchical loops between prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia support reinforcement learning at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this promotes flexible behavior. To this end, we will address three aims: 1. We will show that the same reinforcement learning computations happen in parallel at multiple levels of abstraction, as hypothesized by our computational model of prefrontal- subcortical networks. 2. We will demonstrate that humans partition learning problems into multiple sequential subgoals so they can learn multiple simple strategies instead of one complex strategy, and that reusing these simple strategies promotes fast exploration and learning. 3. We will show that hierarchical learning does not rely exclusively on rewards, but that novelty signals are crucial for identifying subgoals and learning through curiosity. Across all three aims, we will use behavioral experiments in conjunction with computational modeling to characterize how humans learn hierarchically. In addition, we will use EEG and fMRI to identify the neural computations underlying the cognitive systems inferred from behavior and modeling. This project will provide new insights into the computational mechanisms that give rise to learning, and thus provide a better handle on the sources of learning dysfunction observed in many psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, ADHD, and OCD. Additionally, it will provide new tools, in the form of experimental protocols and precise computational models, for studying learning across populations and species. Project Narrative This proposal will explore how learning hierarchically structured representations of our environments helps humans adapt flexibly and efficiently to new situations. We will record how people learn to make simple decisions, observe changes in brain activity, and use mathematical models to study how hierarchical learning happens in the brain. This will help explain how human learning can be so efficient and flexible, how mental conditions such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety cause learning and decision-making impairments, and will help develop better treatments.",The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning,9894854,R01MH119383,"['Address', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Curiosities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Rain', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'bean', 'cognitive system', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,381213,148186688,0.007453618967792071
"Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data 1. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The study of translational biomarkers in brain disorders is a very challenging and fruitful approach, which will empower a better understanding of healthy and diseased brains. This project will promote the translation of advanced engineering solutions and mathematic tools to novel neuroimaging applications in psychiatric disorders including major depression disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ), allowing sophisticated and powerful analyses on highly complex datasets. To date, the unifying syndrome classification (ICD-9/10;DSM-IV/5) for these mental disorders obscures our knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and cannot guide optimal treatments. For example, there is no biomarker that is able to precisely predict response of MDD to some treatments. One reason for this is that most neuroimaging prediction studies to date have used a single imaging measure or reported simple correlation relationships, without considering multimodal cross- information, nonlinear relationships, or multi-site cross-validation. Hence, developing novel data mining techniques such as deep learning, fusion with reference, and sparse regression can complement and exploit the richness of neuroimaging data, providing promising avenues to identify objective biomarkers and going beyond a descriptive use of brain imaging as traditionally used in studies of brain disease to individualized prediction. We will facilitate the translational biomarker identification by developing 3 novel data-driven methods: 1) A supervised fusion model that can provide insight on how cognitive impairment may affect covarying brain function and structure in mental disorder, by using different clinical measures as a reference to guide multimodal MRI fusion; 2) A cutting-edge prediction framework with aggregated feature selection techniques that is able to estimate clinical outcome more precisely, e.g., remission/relapse status of individual MDD patient after electroconvulsive treatment(ECT) using baseline brain imaging and demographic measures of 3) We will draw on advances and ideas from deep learning combined with layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) or attention modules, to classify multiple groups of psychiatric disorders by incorporating dynamic functional measures. The proposed (Deep/Recurrent/Convolutional Neural Network, DNN/RNN/CNN) models will have enhanced interpretability that is able to trace back and discover the most predictive functional networks from input. All above proposed methods will be applied to big data containing both multimodal imaging and behavioral information (n~5000) pooled from existing studies, and our developed open-source toolboxes will be shared publicly. This pioneering study may provide an urgently-needed paradigm shift in the treatment and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, thereby guiding personalized clinical care. Accomplishment of this project has great potential to discover neuroimaging biomarkers that have been missed by existing approaches, leading to earlier and more effective interventions, and laying the groundwork for a significant translational impact. Project Narrative Psychiatric imaging is struggling with identifying robust biomarkers. Existing approaches do not fully leverage the power of multimodal data, despite evidence that such information is highly informative. We will draw on advances and ideas from fields of deep learning, supervised learning and functional dynamics, to capture rich information from multimodal imaging big data, and to identify precise biomarkers that are able to predict clinical measures for new individuals and help for intervention. We will pool big data from ongoing projects in multiple cohorts, consisting of a big data with imaging and behavioral info to apply clinical applications that will have profound translational medicine impact on schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorders.",Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data,9999673,R01MH117107,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Engineering', 'Functional disorder', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Probability', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive ability', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'depressed patient', 'disease classification', 'effective intervention', 'feature selection', 'flexibility', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'personalized predictions', 'predicting response', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'translational medicine', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,395331,43632870,0.023157451913001795
"Nobrainer: A robust and validated neural network tool suite for imagers There is an increasing need for efficient and robust software to process, integrate, and offer insight across the diversity of population imaging efforts underway across the BRAIN Initiative and other projects. Advances in statistical learning offer a set of technologies that can address many research applications using the extensive and varied data being produced by the projects. This can transform how we analyze and integrate new data. We propose using Nobrainer, an open source Python library that leverages these new learning technologies, as a platform that greatly simplifies integrating deep learning into neuroimaging research. Using this library, we are building and distributing user-friendly and cloud enabled end-user applications for the neuroimaging community. In Aim 1, we provide neural network models. We will create robust, pre-trained neural networks for brain segmentation and time series processing using brain scans from over 65000 individuals. Once trained, these models can then be used as the basis for many other applications, especially in reducing time of processing. We will subsequently use these base networks to perform image processing, image correction, and quality control. In Aim 2, we address the ability to train on private datasets. We will use Bayesian neural network models, which support principled use of prior information. We will use these networks to help detect when the models are expected to fail on an input, and provide visualizations to better understand how the model is working. In Aim 3, we focus on the engineering needed to maintain the software infrastructure, improve efficiency, and increase the scalability of our training methods. Here, we will extend, maintain, and disseminate Nobrainer, our open source software framework, together with training materials and ready to use, cloud-friendly, applications. We will also create much faster, neural network equivalents of time consuming image processing tasks (e.g., registration, segmentation, and annotation). The Nobrainer tools developed through these aims will allow users to find and apply the most pertinent applications and developers to extend the framework to support new architectures and disseminate new models and applications. We expect these tools to be used by any neuroimaging researcher through integration with BRAIN archives and popular software packages. These tools will significantly reduce data processing and new model development time, thus allowing faster exploration of hypotheses using public data and increase reusability of data through greater trust in model outputs. 9/11/2019 ResearchPlan - Google Docs The proposal will create artificial intelligence software for scientists to analyze, integrate, and visualize data from large brain imaging projects, which inform our understanding of brain structure, function, and development. Open and reusable software helps to increase collaboration and benefits researchers, but can also be used by citizen scientists and students in high schools and colleges. An open collection of neural network tools will facilitate scientific communities and has the potential to accelerate scientific discoveries about the nervous system. https://docs.google.com/document/d/11s9ZRzy8tHs6NguzpnJdJUWRgLvdkXpEYjZchtJXSmY/edit# 2/23",Nobrainer: A robust and validated neural network tool suite for imagers,10021957,RF1MH121885,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Bayesian neural network', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain scan', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Libraries', 'Longevity', 'Memory', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nervous system structure', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Pythons', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Framework', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Trust', 'Uncertainty', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'citizen science', 'cognitive development', 'college', 'computerized data processing', 'connectome', 'data reuse', 'deep learning', 'distributed data', 'diverse data', 'high school', 'image processing', 'imager', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'network models', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'open source', 'software infrastructure', 'statistical learning', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,RF1,2020,419908,113554200,0.015287992328050747
"Deep-learning based spatial multiple testing for Alzheimer's neuroimaging data Project Summary The broad objective of this research is to develop a powerful deep-learning based multiple testing approach for high-dimensional spatial data that arise commonly in biomedical imaging studies, in particular, brain imaging studies. The motivating problem is to detect the cerebral metabolic abnormalities in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) from Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) data. Existing multiple testing approaches in solving this problem often ignore or inadequately capture the spatial dependence among the test statistics obtained from brain voxels and thus lose substantial power for the detection. We will develop a novel spatial multiple testing method that utilizes the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), a key deep- learning technique, to well capture the spatial dependence among test statistics and thus to achieve the optimal power in the sense of minimizing the false nondiscovery rate (FNR) while correctly controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at a given level. The proposed DCNN-based FDR controlling method has enhanced power to discover new AD-related brain regions that are missed by conventional methods, thereby leading to novel clinical and pathological studies. The specific aims of this proposal include: 1. To develop an optimal spatial FDR controlling approach by connecting the unsupervised local-significance-index based multiple testing with the supervised DCNN-based image segmentation; 2. To evaluate the proposed spatial FDR controlling approach via extensive simulations under various three-dimensional spatial dependence structures, in comparison with multiple classical and state-of-the-art methods; 3. To apply proposed spatial FDR controlling approach to detect AD-related brain regions using the FDG-PET datasets from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and the Weill Cornell Brain Health Imaging Institute; 4. To develop a user- friendly and publicly available software package with versions in both Python and R to implement the proposed spatial FDR controlling approach. The proposed DCNN-based approach will also be widely applicable to large- scale multiple testing problems in other fields of biomedical research that involve spatial dependence. Project Narrative This project will exploit recent advances in deep learning to efficiently solve the large-scale spatial multiple testing problems that arise commonly in biomedical imaging studies. The proposed powerful deep-learning based spatial multiple testing approach will be particularly useful in brain imaging studies on neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and age-related cognitive impairment.",Deep-learning based spatial multiple testing for Alzheimer's neuroimaging data,10107565,R21AG070303,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Architecture', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Family', 'Fluorine', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population Group', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'brain health', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging study', 'indexing', 'metabolic rate', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'repository', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly']",NIA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,435875,77336088,-0.04439853728230691
"Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by  Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging can provide safe, non-invasive, and whole-brain measurements for large clinical and research studies of brain disorders. However, many disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alterations, which are often difficult to tease out due to limited image quality afforded by the popular 3T MRI scanners (with 20,000+ units available worldwide). Although 7T MRI scanners provide better image quality, these ultrahigh field scanners are not widely available (with only 40+ units available worldwide) and are also not used clinically. Thus, tools for reconstructing 7T-like high-quality MRI from 3T MRI scan are highly desirable. A means for achieving this is by learning the relationship between 3T and 7T MRI scans from training samples. This renewal project is dedicated to developing a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels of 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD. Specifically, (Aim 1) to enhance the image quality of 3T MRI, we will develop a novel deep learning architecture to learn a complex multi-layer 3T-to-7T mapping from training subjects, each with coupled 3T and 7T MRI scans. This mapping will then be applied to reconstruct quality-enhanced 7T-like MRI scans from new 3T MRI scans. (Aim 2) For brain structural measurement (e.g., brain atrophies, and hippocampal volume shrinkage), a crucial step is brain tissue segmentation. We will thus develop a robust and accurate random forest tissue segmentation method, which maps 7T label information to 3T scans. The mapping function is trained using tissue labels generated for 7T scans, instead of 3T scans which often have limited image contrast. (Aim 3) To further quantify local atrophies in ROIs or even sub-ROIs (i.e., hippocampal subfields), we will develop a deformable multi-ROI segmentation method by employing (a) random forest to predict deformation from each image location to the target boundary by adaptive integration of multimodal (anatomical, structural & functional connectivity) information and (b) auto-context model to iteratively refine ROI segmentation results. Note that the adaptive integration of multimodal MRI data, especially resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), is critical to the segmentation of sub-ROIs such as hippocampal subfields, since local functional connectivity patterns can help distinguish boundaries between neighboring subfields that often have different cortico-cortical connections. (Aim 4) Finally, by integrating anatomical features from all accurately segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs and also structural & functional connectivity features between those segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs, we can more effectively detect early-stage brain disorders, i.e., the conversion of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD. We will integrate information from different imaging datasets and multiple imaging centers by using our novel multi-task learning approach for jointly learning the respective disease prediction models. Applications. These computational methods will find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormalities associated with various neurological diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia), measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between imaging and clinical scores. Narrative Description of Project The goal of this renewal project is to achieve robust brain measurements from the routine 3T MRI, guided by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI. To this end, we will create a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels from 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new testing subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD.",Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI,9977173,R01EB006733,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Atrophic', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain tissue', 'cerebral atrophy', 'contrast imaging', 'deep learning', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multi-task learning', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'random forest', 'research study', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,438169,511185245,-0.007038311952502387
"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research. We develop new knowledge and a novel tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding volunteers in innovative neuroscience research, to ensure ethical participation, enhance trust in science, and accelerate discovery.",Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain,9993927,R01MH114856,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell model', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Human Volunteers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Personhood', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'brain research', 'clinical care', 'decision research', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'insight', 'member', 'neuroethics', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'patient engagement', 'prevent', 'programs', 'sound', 'standard measure', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'volunteer']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,454017,560644462,0.024940801571904783
"Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets Project Summary Morphometric analysis is a primary algorithmic tool to discover disease and drug related effects on brain anatomy. Neurological degeneration and disease manifest in subtle and varied changes in brain anatomy that can be non-local in nature and affect amounts of white and gray matter as well as relative positioning and shapes of local brain anatomy. State-of-the-art morphometry methods focus on local matter distribution or on shape variations of apriori selected anatomies but have difficulty in detecting global or regional deterioration of matter; an important effect in many neurodegenerative processes. The proposal team recently developed a morphometric analysis based on unbalanced optimal transport, called UTM, that promises to be capable of discovering local and global alteration of matter without the need to apriori select an anatomical region of interest. The goal of this proposal is to develop the UTM technology into a software tool for automated high-throughput screening of large neurological image data sets. A more sensitive automated morphometric analysis tool will help researchers to discover neurological effects related to disease and lead to more efficient screening for drug related effects. Project Narrative  Describing anatomical differences in neurological image datasets is a key technology to non-invasively discover the effects of disease processes or drug treatments on brain anatomy. Current morphometric analysis focuses on local matter composition and on the shape of a priori defined regions of interest. The goal of this proposal is to extend the capabilities of image based morphometric analysis to be able to discover regionally varying deterioration and alteration of matter without the need for fine-grained segmentations and a priori definitions of regions of interest.",Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets,10139715,R42MH118845,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'HIV', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Effect', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Software Validation', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Washington', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'data access', 'data infrastructure', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'high throughput screening', 'image registration', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'metabolic rate', 'morphometry', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurodegenerative dementia', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'regional difference', 'research and development', 'shape analysis', 'software development', 'software infrastructure', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'usability', 'web app', 'web services', 'white matter']",NIMH,"KITWARE, INC.",R42,2020,456359,5161939,-0.004622399464381033
"Multi-level statistical classification of substance use disorder ABSTRACT This application represents our ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of substance use disorders (SUDs). This research is achieved through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data that combine clinical symptoms and diagnoses, imaging markers, and genotypes. The team has a PI with expertise in computational science and the development and implementation of innovative statistical algorithms to understand multidimensional data; a PI with extensive experience in systems, imaging and addiction neuroscience; and a co-I who has expertise in the genetics of SUDs. Our previous R01 project employed a sample of ~12,000 individuals aggregated from multiple genetic studies of alcohol and drug dependence to generate SUD subtypes based on clinical symptoms. Because clinical manifestations are distal endpoints in the biological pathway, the genetic effects identified are often weak and inconsistent, and consequently difficult to detect even in large samples. As championed by the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) research, the etiologies of psychiatric disorders, including SUDs, can be fruitfully characterized by dimensional neural features. This project thus extends our ongoing work to include imaging neural features in the classification of SUDs. Specifically, we will utilize a large database from the UK Biobank Project that provides both genetic and multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Building on our work with the US Human Connectome Project, we aim in the current project to integrate clinical, imaging, and genotype data to investigate the neurobiological substrates of SUD diagnostic labels, and to derive SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. Methodologically, we replace the classic statistical analysis that is confirmatory and biased to an a priori hypothesis by an approach that emphasizes pattern discoveries from big data. Our specific aims are to: (I): identify neuroimaging features that represent robust markers of addiction and differentiate SUD subtypes that can be confirmed by multi-modality evidence; (II) employ a novel brain connectivity model, on the basis of graph convolutional neural networks, to identify neural markers that precisely characterize the differences in structural changes and functional circuits related to SUDs; and (III) derive an innovative machine learning model to identify highly heritable neurobiological subtypes of SUDs that facilitate investigation of the genetic basis of addiction. We will focus on alcohol and nicotine use disorders to demonstrate the conceptual and methodological approaches. We believe that, by providing a productive conceptual and methodological platform to integrate imaging and genetic data to understand the etiologies of SUDs, this research is highly responsive to the RFA “Leveraging Big Data Science to Elucidate the Neural Mechanisms of Addiction and SUD.” The machine learning tools developed for this project will provide an innovative and reliable foundation to enhance the aggregation and analysis of multidimensional data, and to meet the diagnostic and predictive challenges in mental health research.

"Developing a robust platform to identify unexpected and novel viruses in human brain tissue Project Summary / Abstract  Central nervous system infections with RNA viruses cause severe neurological deficits and death, and are extremely challenging to diagnose. This multiple PI proposal presents an innovative research program that will provide the foundation for a comprehensive viral diagnostics pipeline to rapidly diagnose RNA virus infections from surgical brain biopsies. The investigators will combine two cutting-edge techniques for viral detection, screening with double-stranded RNA immunohistochemistry (dsRNA IHC) to identify cases with a high likelihood of a viral etiology, and unbiased metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) for specific virus identification and genome analysis.  To develop the dsRNA IHC screening assay, six commercially available anti-dsRNA antibodies will be optimized in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) brain tissue and evaluated in a series of known infectious and non-infectious cases. The top candidates will be tested in a set of brain biopsies with inflammation of unclear etiology and compared to results of mNGS performed in parallel. The development of this assay will facilitate efficient screening of FFPE tissue samples from patients with neurological disease of unclear pathogenesis to identify those with a high likelihood of viral etiology. To improve mNGS methods for FFPE brain tissue, new laboratory techniques will be tested to increase the yield and quality of viral RNA extracted. In addition to virus identification, mNGS will be used to perform full-genome deep sequencing of viruses. These results can be applied to molecular epidemiology, disease surveillance, and understanding pathogen-host interactions. Overall, this project will enhance our understanding of RNA viruses that cause CNS infection, inform future studies of virus evolution and pathogenesis, and lay the foundation for the development of a comprehensive viral diagnostics pipeline that will substantially improve the care of patients with devastating CNS infections. This work aligns very well with the NINDS mission to seek and apply fundamental knowledge of the brain to reduce the burden of neurological disease.  This R21 Exploratory Neuroscience Research Grant proposal will support and expand the collaboration between the two PIs. The unique combination of expertise in neuropathology, infectious disease pathology, virology, clinical infectious disease, and metagenomic sequencing demonstrate the requisite skills and perspective needed to achieve the goals of this proposal. The stimulating environments of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard University, and Emory University are extremely well suited to the proposed research plan, which not only provide critical equipment and facilities infrastructure, but also mentorship, formal opportunities to present and discuss results, and eventual venues to implement this clinical testing prospectively. Project Narrative Viral infections of the central nervous system cause significant illness and death, and in many patients the specific virus causing infection is never found. This project will develop new tools to detect viruses in brain tissue, including previously unknown viruses, and sequence their genomes. The objectives of this project are to improve diagnostics for patients with devastating neurological illness, and to open new research directions in studying viruses that cause central nervous system infection.",Developing a robust platform to identify unexpected and novel viruses in human brain tissue,10105533,R21NS119660,"['Adenoviruses', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Applications Grants', 'Arboviruses', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Case Study', 'Central Nervous System Infections', 'Central Nervous System Viral Diseases', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Cytoplasmic Inclusion', 'DNA Viruses', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Double-Stranded RNA', 'Encephalitis', 'Enterovirus', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Herpesviridae', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentorship', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Target', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Neurologic Symptoms', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Nodule', 'Nuclear Inclusion', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Probability', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Virus Infections', 'RNA Viruses', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Shotgun Sequencing', 'Specimen', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissue Sample', 'Universities', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Woman', 'Work', 'assay development', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cost', 'cross reactivity', 'deep sequencing', 'fungus', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'innovation', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuropathology', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel virus', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'prospective test', 'rRNA Genes', 'rapid diagnosis', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool', 'viral RNA', 'viral detection', 'viral genomics', 'virology', 'virus identification', 'whole genome']",NINDS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2020,480375,327644200,0.006945455250207963
"Distinguishing normal aging from age-related macular degeneration at the level of single cells int eh living human eye Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in the developed world; no cure exists and prevalence is rising rapidly. Because only primates have a macula and since no model of AMD exists in non-human primates, the disease course can only be elucidated through in-depth study of humans. Blindness in AMD is caused by progressive and irreversible death of rod and cone photoreceptors secondary to degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) that is essential for their health and function. Clinical imaging and histology have informed us greatly about the later stages of disease but fundamental knowledge to understand how AMD diverges from normal aging at onset is lacking. With advanced adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy (AOO) imaging methods, combined with clinical imaging and visual function testing, we will characterize healthy human retinal aging in cross-sectional study, by defining the in vivo RPE-photoreceptor cellular organization and microscopic autofluorescence variation with age and wavelength. This will produce the largest quantitative in vivo normative dataset of AOO cell-based metrics to date and we will use this data to generate new quantitative analysis tools needed to evaluate emerging therapies designed to prevent or slow vision loss in AMD (Aim 1). In a case-control study, we will then compare normal photoreceptor topography and RPE cell morphometry to clinically defined early AMD to quantitatively define the earliest cellular changes in AMD that can be detected in vivo. This work will identify the cellular alterations and phenotypes that differentiate normal aging from early AMD to facilitate early onset detection. These results will be contextualized by comparison to tissue-level alterations seen with aging and early AMD in clinical imaging, specifically choriocapillaris decline and drusen (Aim 2). The results of this study will result in a paradigm shift from the use of clinical diagnosis and classification systems for AMD that rely solely on tissue- level biomarkers or traditional funduscopic clinical signs to those that rely on rigorous quantitative in vivo cell- based metrics. Together, this knowledge and these tools will lay the foundation needed to develop and evaluate new preventative therapies that are needed to limit or prevent vision loss in AMD. Project Narrative Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in the US and is a significant public health issue that is projected to worsen due to the rapidly aging population. Here we aim to understand how retinal cells change in normal aging and how these normal age-related changes differ from the changes that lead to age-related macular degeneration. This project will allow us to detect age-related macular degeneration earlier and will produce new tools to monitor retinal cells that will facilitate the development and testing of preventative therapies to slow or prevent vision loss in age-related macular degeneration.",Distinguishing normal aging from age-related macular degeneration at the level of single cells int eh living human eye,9973645,R01EY030517,"['Age', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Choroid', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cytoplasmic Granules', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Drusen', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lipofuscin', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Melanins', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Perfusion', 'Phenotype', 'Photoreceptors', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive therapy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Primate Diseases', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Retina', 'Retinal Cone', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Retinal Photoreceptors', 'Risk', 'Secondary to', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'Structure of retinal pigment epithelium', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapy Evaluation', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Vertebrate Photoreceptors', 'Vision', 'Work', 'adaptive optics', 'age related', 'aging population', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'early onset', 'fluorophore', 'healthy aging', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'macula', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neurovascular unit', 'nonhuman primate', 'normal aging', 'prevent', 'restorative treatment', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal rods', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,527040,570146095,-0.0016103291669704988
"SPOTs: Optical Technologies for Instantly Quantifying Multicellular Response Profiles PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Human organ systems require temporally and spatially coordinated multicellular actions at a macroscale to actuate, sustain, or terminate dedicated and vital functions. Cells that comprise discrete or distributed physiologic systems that fail to respond to appropriate stimuli with coordination may cause significant morbidity and often mortality. Collective and coordinated physiologic activities typically involve millions to billions of cells that may span large physical distances. Technologies for quantifying the electrical, chemical, and mechanical coupling in these multicellular systems are critically important to understanding the underlying mechanisms of disease and develop therapeutic approaches. However, no technology currently exists to quantify rapid mechanical cell responses to transmitted distal perturbations for all cells within a collection of cells. This multi- PI proposal (Chiou (contact PI) and Teitell) aims to develop a new platform imaging technology called SPOT (single pixel optical technology) for concurrent and direct measurements of cellular traction forces over a 1.0 x 1.0 cm2 field of view (FOV) with cellular spatial resolution, and a 1,000 frames/sec temporal resolution. SPOT provides a 4-order of magnitude larger FOV than conventional traction force microscopy. Cardiomyocytes (CMs) are the test bed here because of a high potential for impact in cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of mortality in the Western World. We will demonstrate the ability for SPOT to determine quantitative indices of abnormalities for human CM contraction and relaxation in healthy and diseased states. We will establish proof of concept studies in SPOT screens for small molecules that augment or affect CM contraction in desmoplakin deficient states. We will build a platform that integrates SPOT for direct contraction force measurements and Optical Mapping for electrical property measurements for sheets of CMs. This will enable, for the first time, studies of temporal and spatial electromechanical coupling behaviors for sheets of CMs at single cell resolution. We will distinguish different subtypes of CMs, their distributions, their interactions, and their phenotypic responses under external perturbations. And we will apply this platform to investigate the structural and electromechanical coupling properties of hESC-derived CMs by integrating quantitative biomass and stiffness data measured using non-invasive live cell interferometry (LCI). Changes in biomass and cell stiffness are druggable biophysical parameters with correlates to mechanical contraction/relaxation cycles of CMs. In addition to detailed studies of CMs that have the potential to impact the number one killer of US citizens, SPOT applications should have utility and provide new insights in additional settings that require cell or tissue traction-force generation. Such settings could include models in a dish for wound healing, cancer cell metastasis, or models of diseases that affect cell and tissue structural integrity, such as connective tissue disorders Ehlers-Danlos or Marfan syndromes. PROJECT NARATIVE Our proposal is exclusively technology development but portends public health relevance because we will invent a way to quantify previously undiscoverable interactions and mechanical responses to external and internal perturbations in interconnected biological systems, as occurs in physiologic and pathologic states. We will develop, test and fine-tune a new technology platform called SPOT (Single Pixel Optical Technology) to extract mechanical responses at cellular resolution in a very wide field, in real-time, concurrently for all cells in a sheet to enable studies and potentially new-age therapeutics that are currently impossible.",SPOTs: Optical Technologies for Instantly Quantifying Multicellular Response Profiles,9972477,R01GM127985,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Biomass', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Connective Tissue Diseases', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Distal', 'Drug Screening', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fibroblasts', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Giant Cells', 'Goals', 'Heart Atrium', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'Interferometry', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Marfan Syndrome', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Optics', 'Pathologic', 'Pharmacology Study', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Spottings', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Traction', 'Traction Force Microscopy', 'Transplantation', 'Ventricular', 'Western World', 'biological systems', 'biophysical properties', 'body system', 'cancer cell', 'design', 'desmoplakin', 'electrical measurement', 'electrical property', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human pluripotent stem cell', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'mechanical properties', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'patch clamp', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'regenerative', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'wound healing']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,530374,673201228,-0.01976983334166555
"Glutamate Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (GluCEST) Imaging in Cognitive Aging Healthy older adults (HOA) confront complex and life-changing decisions in the face of declining neural resources. Changes in aged brains include shrinkage of neurons and their projections in several areas, such as the neocortex, hippocampus and substantia nigra.1 These age-related structural brain changes, typically measured using in vivo techniques (e.g. MRI), reflect cellular changes. Glutamate (Glu) is a key molecule in cellular metabolism, the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian nervous system, and the principal neurotransmitter of cortical efferents.2,3 Alterations in brain Glu likely contribute to the neural mechanisms underlying age-related declines in behavioral and cognitive functions.4 Yet, only a few studies4-11 have investigated age-related changes in brain Glu, in vivo, during healthy aging. Most of these have used standard techniques and as a result our understanding of the role that brain Glu has in typical and atypical aging remains limited. Here, I aim to fill significant gaps in the field, by 1) assessing brain Glu using a novel magnetization transfer technique—Glutamate Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (GluCEST)—on an ultra-high field 7T MRI scanner, enables the measurement of brain Glu across the cerebrum in humans.12; 2) assess cognitive performance using a highly sensitive computerized neurocognitive battery (Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB)); and 3) explore the possibility of aging biotypes based upon age- related changes in brain glutamate.  Here, we propose to investigate alterations in brain glutamate in 100 HOA (60-85 years of age) using GluCEST 7T MRI and relate alterations in brain Glu to age-related changes in cognitive functioning, including, memory, and executive function. Moreover, we will contrast age-related patterns with data from young adults (18-30 years of age). Finally, we leverage data from a large consortium, iSTAGING (directed by Co- Investigator Davatzikos), to employ recently developed machine-learning techniques (e.g. HYDRA13), to classify subgroups of older adults based upon unique patterns of brain structure associated with typical, atypical and resilient aging. These subtypes will be applied within our sample and patterns of brain glutamate can then be measured within these subtypes. The proposed studies will provide more specific and sensitive in vivo measurements of brain glutamate in HOA. This proposal will enable testing of specific hypothesis about the regional distribution of brain Glu, its relation to aging, and its contribution to cognitive functioning in aging. As such, these studies can provide crucial preliminary data for longitudinal studies in healthy and pathological aging by targeting a specific neural mechanism associated with cognition and disease progression. RELEVANCE Older adults tend to focus on positive emotional information more than their younger counterparts. The psychological and neural mechanisms of this positivity bias remain unclear and it is possible that an age-related reduction in executive function contribute to this bias. Moreover, it remains unclear whether the positivity bias is maintained in those at risk for developing dementia. This positivity and and  roject aims to characterize this emergence of this bias across the lifespan and determine its role in the early stages of dementia those at risk for developing dementia using computerized assessment of emotion cognition. p",Glutamate Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (GluCEST) Imaging in Cognitive Aging,10241606,R56AG066656,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Chemicals', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Failure', 'Glutamates', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Metabolism', 'Neocortex', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Reaction Time', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'base', 'brain size', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'executive function', 'frontal lobe', 'healthy aging', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'pathological aging', 'psychologic', 'rapid growth', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'supervised learning', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R56,2020,532865,593605914,0.01737527298846079
"Exploration of MRI measures of neurodegeneration within individuals over short intervals PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY  Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia affect over five million Americans. Alzheimer's disease begins with changes in the brain more than a decade before the disease can be diagnosed from memory and cognitive impairment in a clinic. The goal of this work is to provide a way to measure early signs of neurodegeneration in individual people. The historical barrier to measure change in individuals is that each person's brain is different with change accumulating too slowly to be picked over short intervals. As a result, most research focuses on tracking averaged subject groups or tracking change over multiple years. The present work optimizes new brain imaging techniques using MRI to make extremely fast, highly precise repeated measurements of brain regions all within the same individual. The work then seeks to use the novel imaging approach to measure neurodegeneration in individuals with early stages of Alzheimer's disease in six months or less and also differentiate changes in people with Alzheimer's disease from less common forms of dementia that have distinct anatomical changes in the brain. If successful, the present work will provide a new means to track the early stages of neurodegeneration as would be used in clinical trials and translational medical research. NARRATIVE  The proposed research explores the possibility of precisely estimating change in specific brain structures in individuals at early stages of neurodegeneration. Anchoring from recent developments in fast brain scanning techniques, we use a novel methodological approach that permits a tremendous increase in the precision of measuring change within a single person by repeatedly, safety, and efficiently scanning the brain over time. Demonstrating successful precision measurement within the individual will open opportunities to track therapeutic effects in small samples during early phases of development as well as allow for individualized estimates of neurodegeneration to be made dynamically within the same person. !",Exploration of MRI measures of neurodegeneration within individuals over short intervals,9971052,R01AG067420,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anatomy', 'Atrophic', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Brain scan', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Memory impairment', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Procedures', 'Progressive Aphasias', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Semantics', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Unmarried person', 'Variant', 'Work', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical translation', 'cognitive change', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'rate of change', 'safety testing', 'secondary analysis', 'tau Proteins', 'therapeutic development', 'time interval', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIA,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,533173,87297083,-0.03426782292569647
"AI2AMP-PD: Accelerating Parkinsons Diagnosis using Multi-omics and Artificial Intelligence AI2AMP-PD: Accelerating Parkinson’s Diagnosis using Multi-omics and Artificial Intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT Parkinson’s disease (PD) affects more than 7 million people worldwide, and biomarkers to bolster the therapeutic pipeline are urgently needed. Developing biomarkers for clinical use is a difficult process that requires evaluation of multiple, large cohorts, each adding confidence to the marker. The Accelerating Medicine Partnership in Parkinson’s disease (AMP PD) consortium provides an unparalleled opportunity to rapidly achieve this previously elusive goal.  We hypothesize that a powerful, multi-omics classifier powered by standard and advanced machine learning algorithms will accurately identify PD-associated biomarkers at genome scale. Transcripts and genomic classifiers associated with PD will be identified in early-stage, untreated, patients with Dopamine Transporter- neuroimaging-supported diagnosis represented in the PPMI cohort. Transcripts and genomic classifiers will be rigorously replicated in the independent PDBP and BioFIND cohorts. Multi-omics classifiers using both PD- associated transcriptome changes and PD-associated genomic variants will be built with state-of-the-art deep learning techniques (e.g. variational autoencoder).  This analysis will powerfully delineate --- for the first time --- the full spectrum of known and novel, coding and noncoding RNAs linked to PD and detectable in circulating blood cells in a harmonized, large-scale data set. It will develop and test highly innovative multi-omics classifiers and provide a generally useful computational framework for large-scale, unbiased PD biomarker discovery. Project Narrative These large-scale studies are relevant to public health for two reasons. First, they will reveal the biomarker genes whose dysregulation of expression level is associated with (and possibly causal of) early development of Parkinson’s disease. Secondly, the multi-omics, DNA-RNA predictive model built here based on large dataset and advanced deep learning methods will provide a computational framework for further biomarker development and early disease prediction.",AI2AMP-PD: Accelerating Parkinsons Diagnosis using Multi-omics and Artificial Intelligence,10157680,U01NS120637,"['Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'DNA', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'deep learning', 'differential expression', 'disease diagnosis', 'dopamine transporter', 'feature selection', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic signature', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'large scale data', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'multiple omics', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'transcriptome']",NINDS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2020,537000,327644200,0.01901680305630959
"Quantitative analysis of estrogen and sleep deprivation-induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling in the brain system Abstract Numerous small vessels making up the central nervous system blood and lymphatic vascular networks are heterogeneous and region-specific dynamic structures, whose segments, position, shape and function can change in response to physiological and pathophysiological conditions. To date it has not been possible to integrate blood and lymphatic vascular elements and their microenvironment to achieve a holistic quantitative characterization of the combined brain and meningeal tissue-scale vascular networks, its structure and function in normal and disease states. This application proposes to develop microscopy- based high-throughput image analysis techniques for automated extraction of blood and lymphatic vascular networks enabling quantitative morphodynamic characterization of cerebrovascular microenvironment changes in two intracranial compartments – the brain and dura mater. The study will focus on new algorithms for precise region-specific microvessel registration, mosaicing, segmentation, fusion and colocalization for constructing large tissue scale spatially aligned dual blood/lymphatic vascular network structural maps in the animals of both sexes, as well as characterization of heterogeneities of microvascular networks, including blood and lymphatic vasculature, under estrogen and sleep deprivation (the conditions relevant to multiple cerebrovascular disorders) compared to physiological settings. In other words, advanced microscopy-based techniques will be used to image blood and lymphatic vessels at sub-micron resolution in dura mater and the brain, and then cutting-edge deep machine learning imaging analysis methods will be employed to segment and quantify these vessels, their geometry, vessel wall structure, functionality, and interrelationship. Detailed structural analysis of microvascular networks is essential for accurate evaluation of the distribution of physical forces, substrate delivery and tissue clearance of waste, as well as sex differences and consequences of intracranial networks remodeling under physiological and pathological conditions. This will create knowledge enabling a better understanding of the pathogenesis of vascular impairments under estrogen and sleep deprivation, identify common molecular mechanisms and the efficacy and effectiveness of different therapeutic treatments. Without the ability to construct total structural and functional blood/lymphatic vascular network maps from studies limited to individual tissue component parts, it is little wonder that translation from the molecular and cellular levels to the whole organ and system levels is deficient and hinders translational progress towards a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology associated with a range of neurological disorders. Detailed analysis of structural relationships of both blood and lymphatic circulation in the brain system will have a direct impact on our general understanding of vascular function in brain/meningeal communication, and the cause and resolution of numerous diseases resulting from intracranial vascular disorders including impact of sex hormone (estrogen) deprivation, sleep deprivation, migraines, stroke, multiple sclerosis, dural arterio-venous fistulae, intradural hygroma and hematoma, spontaneous cerebral spinal fluid leaks, and intradural aneurysms that can lead to the development of neurological and cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer's. Quantitative description of blood and lymphatic vessel network structures using image analytics and machine learning algorithms distributed as software tools will have broad applications to quantification of other thin complex curvilinear anatomical structures (i.e. nerves, neuronal circuits, neurons, and neuroglia). The new software for blood and vessel network measurement will enable translation of fundamental pathophysiological knowledge gained from this proposal towards the development and assessment of the effectiveness of treatments and therapeutic interventions to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability associated with a range of neurological disorders.",Quantitative analysis of estrogen and sleep deprivation-induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling in the brain system,9914136,R01NS110915,"['Acute', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Aneurysm', 'Animals', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Insomnia', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cystic Lymphangioma', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dura Mater', 'Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Estrogens', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional disorder', 'Geometry', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Health', 'Hematoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lymphatic', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meningeal', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Migraine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Nerve', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Parietal', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Sex Differences', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Software Tools', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Subdural Hematoma', 'Subdural Hygroma', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinness', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Vascular resistance', 'Venous', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'body system', 'cerebral microvasculature', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinically relevant', 'confocal imaging', 'deep learning', 'deprivation', 'disability', 'geometric structure', 'in vivo', 'lymphatic circulation', 'lymphatic vasculature', 'lymphatic vessel', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'microleakage', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuronal circuitry', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'response', 'sex', 'sleep pattern', 'solute', 'stem', 'submicron', 'tool', 'wasting']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2020,540520,63611576,0.01584280032488056
"Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract  The brain is extremely complex as we know, and involves a complicated interplay between functional infor- mation interacting with a structural (but not static) substrate. Brain imaging technology provides a way to sample various aspects of the brain albeit incompletely, providing a rich set of multitask and multimodal information. The field has advanced significantly in its approach to multimodal data, as there are more studies correlating, e.g. functional and structural measures. However, the vast majority of studies still ignore the joint information among two or more modalities or tasks. Such information is critical to consider as each brain imaging modality reports on a different aspect of the brain (e.g. gray matter integrity, blood flow changes, white matter integrity). The field is still striving to understand how to diagnose and treat complex mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and others, and ignoring the joint information among tasks and modalities misses a critical, but available, part of the puzzle. Combining multimodal imaging data is not easy since, among other reasons, the combination of multiple data sets consisting of thousands of voxels or timepoints yields a very high dimen- sional problem, requiring appropriate data reduction strategies. In the previous phase of the project we devel- oped advanced approaches to capture high-dimensional relationships among 2 or more modalities. Our work continues to strongly support the benefits of multimodal data fusion to both provide a more complete picture of brain function and structure, but also to improve our ability to study and predict the impact of complex mental illness. In this new phase of the project, we will focus on methods that can fill some existing gaps, such as the ability to bridge spatial/temporal as well as structural/functional connectivity scales. We also propose a novel framework to integrate unimodal and multimodal features called chromatic fusion, which searches for combina- tions of multimodal `notes' which occupy a unique position in a latent (or dictionary) space. The proposed meth- ods will be validated using simulations, hybrid-data, and large N normative imaging data. Our proposed approach will be thoroughly tested using this large data set which includes multiple illnesses that have overlapping symp- toms and which can sometimes be misdiagnosed and treated with the wrong medications for months or years (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar depression). We will provide open source tools and release data throughout the duration of the project via GitHub and the NITRIC repository, hence enabling other investigators to compare their own methods with our own as well as to apply them to a large variety of brain disorders. 37 Project Narrative  The promise of multimodal imaging is clear, and our work has clearly shown the substantial benefits of ex- tracting multimodal features estimated jointly from the data. In this renewal, we focus on some key understudied areas including fusing across vast spatiotemporal and functional/structural connectivity scales as well as devel- oping powerful new frameworks for integrating the resulting information to enable decision making and enable identification of potential targets for further study or possible treatment. Completion of our aims will result in a powerful new toolkit for data fusion of multimodal brain imaging data. 36",Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers,10058554,R01EB006841,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Pythons', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'data fusion', 'data reduction', 'deep learning', 'design', 'feature extraction', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple datasets', 'multitask', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'patient subsets', 'potential biomarker', 'repository', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'white matter']",NIBIB,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,542808,43632870,0.01689079224301192
"Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets Project Summary During the past three decades non-invasive functional brain imaging has developed immensely in terms of measurement technologies, analysis methods, and innovative paradigms to capture information about brain function both in healthy and diseased individuals. Although functional MRI (fMRI) has become very useful, it only provides indirect information about neuronal activity through the neurovascular coupling with a limited temporal resolution. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) remain the only available noninvasive techniques capable of directly measuring the electrophysiological activity with a millisecond resolution. During the past eight years we have developed, with NIH support, the MNE-Python software, which covers multiple methods of data preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. To further extend our software to meet the needs of a growing user base and reflect recent developments in the MEG/EEG field we will pursue three specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will: (i) Create an all-embracing suite of noise cancellation tools incorporating and extending methods present in different MEG systems; (ii) Implement device independent methods for head-movement determination and compensation on the basis of head movement data recorded during a MEG session; (iii) Develop methods for automatic tagging of artifacts using machine learning approaches. In Aim 2 our focus is to extend the software to make modern distributed computing resources easily usable in processing and to allow for remote visualization without the need to move large amounts of data across the network. Finally, in Aim 3, we will continue to develop MNE-Python using best programming practices ensuring multiplatform compatibility, extensive web-based documentation, training and forums, and hands-on training workshops. As a result of these developments the MNE-Python will be able to effectively process large number of subjects and huge amounts data ensuing and from multi-site studies harmoniously across different MEG/EEG systems. Narrative MEG and EEG can be used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. However, widespread use of these methods especially in large populations has been problematic because of the lack of well-established analysis approaches, which map the sensor data into the brain space for detailed temporal, spatial, and connectivity analysis. This research will provide well-documented and tested novel analysis software to promote both basic neuroscience and clinical research applications using MEG and EEG.",Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets,9934294,R01NS104585,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Experimental Designs', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Language Development', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Online Systems', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'Writing', 'analysis pipeline', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cluster computing', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data exchange', 'falls', 'human data', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'millisecond', 'multithreading', 'neurovascular coupling', 'novel', 'open source', 'pedagogy', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'software development', 'source localization', 'symposium', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'verification and validation']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,543993,551214295,0.0044521188942707336
"A New J-Resolved MRSI Framework for Whole-Brain Simultaneous Metabolite and Neurotransmitter Mapping PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The metabolite and neurotransmitter profiles of neural tissues provide a unique window into brain’s physiological state and can be used to extract potential biomarkers for detecting and characterizing neurodegenerative diseases. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) allows simultaneous mapping and quantification of a number of metabolites and neurotransmitters without exogenous contrast agents thus promised tremendous opportunities for molecular imaging of the brain. However, due to several fundamental technical challenges, including low SNR, poor spatial resolution, long imaging time and inaccurate separation of spectrally overlapping molecular signals, most in vivo MRSI studies to date are still limited to very low-resolution experiments (~1cm3 voxel size) with small brain coverages. The primary goal of this proposed research is to develop, optimize and evaluate a new framework to model, acquire and process MRSI data to enable simultaneous, high-resolution, whole- brain mapping of metabolites and neurotransmitters in clinically feasible time. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1, we will design and implement a novel acquisition strategy that synergistically combines SNR- efficient, multi-slab and multi-TE excitation, sparse sampling in a (k,t,TE)-space and optimized TE selection with maximum echo sampling to generate J-resolved (multi-TE) MRSI data with an unprecedented combination of speed, resolution and organ coverage. In Aim 2, we will develop novel nonlinear low-dimensional models of general MR spectra using a learning-based strategy that integrates the biochemical priors of neural tissues, known physics-based MRSI signal modeling and deep neural networks. These learned models will effectively reduce the dimensionality of the imaging problem and allow for significantly improved speed, resolution and SNR tradeoffs as well as signal separation. Novel computational solutions that effectively exploit the learned models and other spatial-spectral-TE constraints will be developed for spatiospectral reconstruction of metabolites and neurotransmitters from the noisy, high-resolution J-resolved MRSI data. Finally, in Aim 3, we will systematically evaluate the proposed technology in terms of speed, resolution, SNR, and quantitative accuracy using computer simulations, phantom and in vivo experiments. The feasibility and robustness of the proposed technology for mapping metabolites and neurotransmitters in both healthy volunteers and temporal lobe epilepsy patients with mesial temporal sclerosis will be demonstrated. The success of the proposed research will lead to significant progress for in vivo MRSI and represent an important step towards the creation of a powerful tool for studying the molecular basis of brain functions and diseases. This tool, when fully developed, will add a transformative dimension to the existing neuroimaging technology profiles, with the potential to impact the diagnosis and management of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is a potentially powerful modality that allows simultaneous mapping of a number of metabolites and neurotransmitters noninvasively, which provide a unique window into brain’s physiological states and can be used to extract biomarkers for detecting and characterizing neurodegenerative diseases. However, the current MRSI techniques do not provide the desired combination of resolution, imaging speed and organ coverage for many basic science and clinical applications. The proposed research will develop a new rapid, J-resolved MRSI technology to enable high-resolution, whole-brain mapping of metabolites and neurotransmitters in clinically feasible time, which, if successful, will lead to significant progress for the field of MRSI and an important step towards the creation of a powerful tool for studying the molecular basis of brain functions and diseases.",A New J-Resolved MRSI Framework for Whole-Brain Simultaneous Metabolite and Neurotransmitter Mapping,10057847,R21EB029076,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Basic Science', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging problem', 'Imaging technology', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Sclerosis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Solid', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Water', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical translation', 'computerized data processing', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'experimental study', 'healthy volunteer', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'magnetic field', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'potential biomarker', 'quantum', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2020,565546,76545728,0.029831740533550487
"Discovering the rules for the organization of macaque inferotemporal cortex. Project Summary How is the representation of complex visual objects organized in inferotemporal (IT) cortex, the large brain region responsible for object recognition? To date, areas selective for a few categories such as faces, bodies, and scenes have been found, but the vast majority of IT cortex is “wild,” lacking any known specialization. Various schemes have been proposed for parceling IT, but a comprehensive understanding of IT organization remains elusive. Here, we propose to use fMRI, microstimulation, and electrophysiology to develop a unified understanding of the organization and coding principles of macaque IT. The experiments are motivated by a major advance in computer vision and two key preliminary results from our lab. First, the advent of deep networks trained for object classification makes it possible to generate a parametric object space, providing a quantitative framework to decipher the feature selectivity of single IT cells. Second, our preliminary results suggest that a large portion of macaque IT cortex is topographically organized according to the first two principal components of object space. This topography encompasses at least four distinct networks, each with at least three hierarchical nodes of increasing view invariance, and includes the previously described face and body patch networks. Furthermore, single cells within each network are projecting incoming objects, formatted as vectors in the object space, onto specific preferred axes. Taken together, these results suggest a new hypothesis for IT organization: IT cortex is tiled by networks (i.e., sets of functionally connected nodes, where a node is a patch of IT cells) whose organization and coding principles are very similar to that of the face patch network, and the layout of these networks follows a regular topography specified by the statistical structure of object space. We propose three Specific Aims to rigorously test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will systematically map all networks within IT of individual animals. In Aim 2, we will record responses of cells in each identified network to a large, common set of object stimuli and determine their coding scheme. In Aim 3, we will perturb activity in each network and quantitatively assess effect on object recognition behavior. Together, these three Aims seek to build a comprehensive understanding of IT organization that bridges fMRI, single units, and behavior. Our lab has developed powerful experimental techniques to tackle each of these Aims and has previously applied them to the macaque face patch system. We believe the time is ripe to apply these techniques to the larger problem of how all objects are represented--not just faces. In the same way that Mendeleev’s arrangement of chemical elements according to their atomic mass and chemical properties helped elucidate the electronic structure of atoms, we believe systematic mapping and characterization of all networks in IT will help elucidate the fundamental neural mechanism for object recognition. Narrative This basic research application will investigate how visual objects are processed by the brain. The brain areas we will study are located in the temporal lobe, a brain region especially susceptible to neurological disease including Alzheimer’s disease and epilepsy. The planned studies will provide valuable insight into the fundamental code cells in this region use to represent visual information, and will thereby contribute to better understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases targeting this part of the brain.",Discovering the rules for the organization of macaque inferotemporal cortex.,10006884,R01EY030650,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Epilepsy', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glean', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Macaca', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Monkeys', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'chemical property', 'electronic structure', 'experimental study', 'inferotemporal cortex', 'insight', 'microstimulation', 'movie', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuromechanism', 'object perception', 'object recognition', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'vector', 'visual information']",NEI,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,575750,81181560,-0.005036428296738113
"Defining the anatomical, molecular and functional logic of internal copy circuits involved in dexterous forelimb behaviors Project Summary Behavior is movement, and the effective and efficient execution of movement has served as a fundamental evolutionary force shaping the form and function of the nervous system. Control of the forelimbs to interact with the world is one of the most essential achievements of the mammalian motor system, yet unfortunately these behaviors are particularly vulnerable to disease and injury. The execution of skilled limb movements requires the continuous refinement of motor output across dozens of muscles, suggesting the existence of feedback pathways that enable rapid adjustments. The temporal delays of peripheral pathways, however, suggest that sensory feedback alone cannot explain the sophistication of online motor control. In principle, a more rapid source of feedback would be to convey copies of motor commands internally to the cerebellum to generate predictions of motor outcome, reducing dependence on delayed sensory information. Yet putative copy circuits have been difficult to isolate experimentally, leaving their contributions to movement unclear. Mouse genetic tools offer a means to explore a diverse class of spinal interneurons as a neural substrate for internal copies. Cervical propriospinal neurons (PNs) receive descending motor command input and extend bifurcating axons; one branch projects to forelimb motor neurons and the other projects to the lateral reticular nucleus (LRN), a major cerebellar input, providing an anatomically straightforward means to convey motor copies internally. Yet how diverse classes of PN-LRN circuits are organized and how they each contribute to distinct elements of limb behavior remain unclear. Complicating the problem, the field lacks robust ways for deconstructing complex limb movements into component elements (e.g. reaching, grasping, postural control), and objective means for quantifying these behaviors in mice. Hypothesis: Discrete classes of PN circuits convey distinct types of spinal motor copy information to the LRN, each necessary for separate aspects of forelimb control; this functional logic can be resolved with more quantitative, high-resolution and standardized behavioral assays. To test this overarching hypothesis, Aim 1 uses molecular-genetic circuit mapping approaches and single-cell RNA- sequencing to define the anatomical and molecular organization of four classes of PN-LRN circuits. Identifying the fine-grained structure of these diverse pathways will be essential for establishing how internal copies are conveyed to the cerebellum to control forelimb behavior. Aim 2 addresses the need for more sensitive and unbiased behavioral tools by developing novel assays of discrete elements of forelimb behavior and machine learning approaches for automated quantification of forelimb kinematics. Finally, Aim 3 merges these novel behavioral approaches with intersectional genetic tools, electrophysiological recording and circuit-specific perturbation to functionally dissect PN-LRN circuits and define their modular contributions to dexterous limb control. Ultimately, these studies will yield insight into the function of internal copy circuits throughout the nervous system, and help to lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits. Project Narrative In addition to promoting basic science investigation of motor function, this work can impact the study of motor dysfunction. Skilled movements of the arm and hand are particularly susceptible to disease and injury of the motor system, raising the need for a better understanding of motor circuit organization and more informative strategies for studying the behaviors these circuits control. Merging molecular-genetic tools with novel behavioral approaches will offer a more detailed and comprehensive approach to studying movement, helping to provide greater insight into the neural basis of motor deficits as well as more effective ways to restore or replace lost motor function.","Defining the anatomical, molecular and functional logic of internal copy circuits involved in dexterous forelimb behaviors",9984552,R01NS111479,"['Ablation', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Axon', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cerebellum', 'Cervical', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Distal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Forelimb', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interneurons', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Limb structure', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Structure', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Equilibrium', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Postural adjustments', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Rabies', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Spinal', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Viral', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'arm movement', 'behavioral study', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'improved', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'limb movement', 'molecular subtypes', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'motor disorder', 'mouse genetics', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory feedback', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,R01,2020,579461,65771974,-0.0070669600770159715
"MR Fingerprinting for Epilepsy Abstract Epilepsy affects 65 million people worldwide; approximately 30% of them do not respond to medications but can be cured by surgery. Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a major pathology for medically intractable epilepsies, is frequently missed by visual analysis of the conventional MRI, making surgical treatment very difficult. We propose to develop a novel quantitative MRI acquisition and analysis framework specific for epilepsy patients, which could provide more sensitive and specific measures of brain structure, thereby improving FCD detection and subtype prediction. To this end, the quantitative framework will be developed and validated in three steps: (1) Develop high-resolution Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) scan that allows simultaneous quantification of multiple tissue property maps efficiently, accurately and precisely. These quantitative maps have shown to be more sensitive and specific on detecting and characterizing subtle signal abnormalities. (2) Develop image post-processing methods to analyze quantitative maps, which will provide quantitative measurements that highlight additional morphological features, such as gray-white boundary blurring, abnormal cortical thickness and folding. (3) Develop machine-learning-based feature screening and prediction tools to characterize group-level features differentiating FCD subtypes, and predict individual-level FCD location and subtyping. Because detection and subtype prediction of FCD are both associated with seizure outcomes, epileptologists can use this tool to provide more personalized and customized counseling. The result of our proposed work promises a paradigm shift by converting the current standard-care of visual/qualitative MRI review to a quantitative framework, including data acquisition, post-processing and decision support tool, that would eventually lead to better treatment planning, reduction in unnecessary pre-surgical evaluation tests (especially invasive evaluation), and improved post-operative seizure outcomes in patients with devastating and disabling medically intractable epilepsy. The quantitative nature of our acquisition/analysis methods also makes it possible to be uniformly adopted by other centers with high consistency.

"Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction Project Summary Substance use disorders (SUDs) are increasing in prevalence and are already a leading cause of disability, due in part to the fact that our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is incomplete. Like most neuropsychiatric syndromes, SUDs are highly heterogeneous, and distinct mechanisms may be operative in some individuals but not in others, even within a single diagnostic category. Furthermore, SUDs frequently co- occur with depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric syndromes, complicating efforts to identify molecular and circuit-level mechanisms, and disentangle them from those involved in mood and anxiety disorders. Diagnostic heterogeneity is thus a fundamental obstacle to developing better treatments, identifying biomarkers for quantifying risk for different forms of addiction, and predicting treatment response and relapse. Recently, we developed and validated an approach to discovering and diagnosing subtypes of depression using fMRI measures of functional connectivity, which in turn predicted subtype-specific clinical symptom profiles and treatment outcomes. Here, in response to PAR-18-062, we propose a secondary data analysis that would extend this approach to SUDs, leveraging multiple deeply characterized and large-scale neuroimaging datasets. Our central hypothesis is that individual differences in mechanisms underlying impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution (iRISA) are mediated by distinct forms of dysfunctional connectivity in addiction-related circuits, which in turn interact and give rise to distinct neurophysiological addiction subtypes. In Aim 1, we will use statistical clustering and machine learning methods to delineate these subtypes and optimize classifiers (fMRI biomarkers) for diagnosing them in individual patients, focusing initially on cocaine addiction. In Aim 2, we will validate these subtype-specific biomarkers by first replicating them in a new dataset and then evaluating their longitudinal stability and predictive utility. In Aim 3, we will test whether subtype-specific circuit mechanisms generalize to mediate iRISA functions in other forms of addiction, and define their interactions with distinct mechanisms mediating anhedonia and anxious arousal in patients with comorbid depression and anxiety. Project Narrative Biomarkers have transformed how physicians care for patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a host of other medical conditions by providing quantitative tools for diagnosing disease processes and individualizing treatment decisions. In contrast, biomarkers for addictions remain relatively elusive. This project will test a new strategy for developing neuroimaging (brain scan) biomarkers for diagnosing novel subtypes of addiction in individual patients and then investigate how dysfunction in specific circuits gives rise to specific addiction- related behaviors and clinical symptoms.",Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction,9985102,R01DA047851,"['Abstinence', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Animal Model', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Habits', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Motivation', 'Negative Reinforcements', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcend', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'animal data', 'anxious', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker validation', 'cocaine use', 'comorbid depression', 'comorbidity', 'craving', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'drug seeking behavior', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'machine learning method', 'negative affect', 'negative emotional state', 'network dysfunction', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'reinforcer', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'substance misuse', 'tool']",NIDA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2020,603973,227555357,0.0038953491209004227
"Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular interactions with the environment form the basis of health and disease for all organisms. Exposure to nutrients, toxins, and neighboring cells trigger coordinated molecular responses that impact cell function and metabolism in a beneficial, adaptive, or detrimental manner. Although the benefits of multicellularity for the formation of complex tissue structures or the function of entire organ systems has been long appreciated, it has only recently been understood that microbial inhabitants of vertebrates also have a tremendous impact on host cell function and dysfunction. Despite this, an understanding of these interactions has not moved beyond simple associations, and there are virtually no molecular technologies available that adequately define how a complex microbial ecosystem impacts host cell function, or how the host response to microbial colonization affects the bacterial community. This gap in knowledge is striking when one considers the broad and significant impact that microbes have on human health. In this application, we propose to expressly fill this knowledge gap through development of a novel multimodal imaging pipeline that will provide 3-dimensional information on the molecular heterogeneity of microbial communities and the immune response at the host-pathogen interface.  This proposal combines our expertise in immunology, infection biology, mass spectrometry, small animal imaging, machine learning, and computer vision to develop an integrated multimodal visualization method for studying infectious disease. Our unique approach will computationally combine ultra-high speed (~50px/s) MALDI-TOF images, ultra-high mass resolution (>200,000 resolving power) MALDI FTICR IMS, metal imaging by LA-ICP-IMS, high-spatial resolution optical microscopy, and MR imaging using data-driven image fusion. This strategy will enable 3-D molecular images to be generated for thousands of elements, metabolites, lipids, and proteins with an unprecedented combination of chemical specificity and spatial fidelity more than 50x faster than is currently possible. We will use this next-generation imaging capability to (i) define the heterogeneous microbial subpopulations throughout the 3-D volume of a S. aureus community, (ii) uncover the host molecules that form the abscess and accumulate to restrict microbial growth in murine models, and (iii) elucidate molecular markers that differentiate in vivo biofilms at the host-pathogen interface, between abscesses at various stages of progression, and under distinct degrees of nutrient stress. These studies will uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will enable detailed views of the molecular components of infectious disease with unprecedented resolution through the development of a multimodal, 3-dimensional imaging platform. The proposed technologies will improve throughput and molecular specificity, enable automated high-precision and high-accuracy image alignment, and allow for descriptions of molecular signals in 3-D through the fusion of multi-modal imaging data. These studies will uncover targets for therapeutic intervention and antibiotic development and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research.",Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry,9989025,R01AI138581,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abscess', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance', 'Functional disorder', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nutrient', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'Vertebrates', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'animal imaging', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'body system', 'commensal bacteria', 'experimental study', 'host colonization', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbial community', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'protein expression', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'virtual']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,612684,377931988,-0.013638435752697294
"High resolution mapping of the genetic risk for disease in the aging brain ABSTRACT Brain structure undergoes changes throughout life as part of the normal healthy aging process, yet some genetic factors embedded in our DNA are believed to alter and potentially accelerate the aging process within the brain. While numerous neuroimaging studies have aimed to map the genetics of dementia, differences in populations and approaches confounded with the small effect sizes attributable to any single genetic variant leads to inconsistencies in findings and limited resources to investigate the truth. Dozens of neuroimaging genetic studies have been collected around the world to help better understand the link. However, the independent nature by which the studies often operate may be limiting scientific advance. Instead of collecting new data to answer the same questions, we harmonize brain mapping efforts across existing studies and pool information to not only study differences between the healthy and demented brain, but also examine normal healthy aging trends, and determine the first signs of deviation, and map out the neurobiological effect of genes that confer risk for dementia. In our effort, we aim to pinpoint mechanistic trajectories and brain circuits by which the widely studied ApoE4 genetic haplotype affects brain throughout life. Despite being identified as a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease over 20 years ago, the effects on the brain in populations around the world are remarkably inconsistent. With novel brain mapping techniques across tens of thousands of individuals across the lifespan, we will perform the most well powered brain mapping initiative and build necessary tools to invite other researchers from around the world to add confidence to the findings. We will also determine – with unprecedented power -- how the aggregate risk for AD promotes accelerated brain degeneration with novel expedited longitudinal linear mixed modeling techniques for large scale epidemiological genetic studies with repeat data. Our proposal brings together contributions from multidisciplinary collaborators with world renowned expertise in neurodegeneration, brain mapping, big data, artificial intelligence, epidemiology, genomics and epigenomes, statistical genetics, and molecular and biological psychiatry. Our technical expertise will provide resources for visualizing genetic results at the finest resolution and provide tools for researchers to use our harmonized analyses to structure their own aging hypotheses in populations of men and women around the world, and even target sex-specific hypotheses in aging. As new brain imaging and genetic data is becoming rapidly available, we provide the tools to harmonize the data into this workflow for years to come. Driven by the data sharing and reuse of this proposal, we provide a portal for researchers of today and tomorrow to access findings from all the studies incorporated in this proposal and add to the collective repository of effects. We hope our careful harmonization of data, along with novel mathematics, tools, and selection of targeted hypotheses will guide future collaborative studies for continuous reuse. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Brain aging is a global health concern and a major focus of dozens of large scale research initiatives around the world. Here, we propose a paradigm to use advanced brain imaging techniques in a harmonized fashion across numerous existing datasets, and to map the underlying genetic influences driving neurodegeneration across tens of thousands of individuals. We will provide advanced brain image processing, mathematical tools, and a portal for researchers to access and add to findings.",High resolution mapping of the genetic risk for disease in the aging brain,9923542,R01AG059874,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Psychiatry', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'International', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Sex Differences', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'Visualization software', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'aging brain', 'aging population', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'biobank', 'brain health', 'cognitive testing', 'data harmonization', 'data reuse', 'data sharing', 'data tools', 'demented', 'dementia risk', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome', 'flexibility', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'global health', 'healthy aging', 'image processing', 'imaging genetics', 'insight', 'male', 'men', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'repository', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'sex', 'tool', 'trait', 'trend']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2020,619917,324592664,0.015277478294054198
"Diagnosis of indeterminate brain lesions using MRI-based machine learning and polygenic risk models PROJECT SUMMARY In 2017 an MRI was performed at a rate of over one for every 10 US residents. The majority of these were brain MRIs. Indeterminate mass lesions are present on over 1% of brain MRIs in individuals over 45 years old. Misinterpretation of brain MRI can lead to significant iatrogenic morbidity and mortality. For example, tumefactive Central Nervous System Inflammatory Demyelinating Disease (CNSIDD) is commonly misdiagnosed as a malignancy, even following pathological review. This results in inappropriate brain biopsies, debulking and radiation. While early tumor resection is associated with favorable outcome in patients with high- grade glioma, observation, biopsy at an alternate site or nonsurgical options are often more appropriate for other indeterminate mass lesions that can encompass low-grade primary brain tumor, CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and brain metastasis. Thus, to prevent iatrogenic morbidity, there is a critical need for scalable and reproducible methods to distinguish CNSIDD from other brain lesions, and to accurately diagnose brain tumors prior to biopsy. We recently published a polygenic risk model demonstrating that the 25 known glioma germline risk variants can estimate absolute and lifetime glioma risk. The clinical significance of these models is driven by germline variants that are associated with >4-fold increased risk of glioma. We have also shown that the same 25 germline variants can predict glioma molecular subtype. As a complementary approach, we have shown that imaging characteristics differ across glioma, CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and brain metastases. We have successfully utilized MRI-based machine learning to predict the molecular subtype in high-grade glioma. We hypothesize that both germline genotyping and MRI-based machine learning provide an opportunity to diagnose indeterminate mass lesions as well as predict glioma molecular subtype prior to surgery and thus personalized treatment. The project has the following three aims: Aim 1: Develop and validate a MRI-based machine learning model to differentiate adult diffuse glioma from tumefactive CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and solitary brain metastases of unknown primary. Aim 2: Evaluate sensitivity and specificity of the polygenic glioma risk model to differentiate adult diffuse glioma from tumefactive CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and solitary brain metastases. Aim 3: Integrate the polygenic glioma subtype model and MRI-based machine learning model to predict adult diffuse glioma molecular subtype and validate the integrated model using a prospective cohort. The proposed project will further enhance the care of patients by determining if an early MRI lesion is actually a glioma. Early definitive surgery in these patients could be curative.

"Multi-tissue high-throughput proteomic and genomic study in Parkinson's Disease Project Summary/Abstract Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, affecting more than 6 million people worldwide, with the prevalence projected to double in the next few decades. Despite the improvements in high-throughput genomics and proteomics that have significantly facilitated the advancement of biomarker discovery in other neurodegenerative diseases, there are no reliable biomarkers for PD. Currently, the PD diagnosis relies almost entirely on clinical examination. There are several reasons for the lack of reliable biomarkers in PD including most studies have been focused on single molecules in one tissue, small samples sizes and a lack of independent replication cohorts. To overcome these limitations, we propose leveraging a unique resource that includes quantitative proteomic analysis of ~1,300 proteins from CSF and plasma of clinically diagnosed PD patients coupled with validation in brain samples from autopsy-confirmed PD cases. We will pair the proteomic data with novel and powerful unbiased (hypothesis-free) genomic approaches to select the most plausible candidates for targeted replication studies. This large-scale screening of ~3,110 samples could identify biomarkers of known molecular pathways involving PD or with a clear genetic connection to PD risk. To achieve these goals, we propose three aims: Specific Aim 1: To identify proteins differentially expressed in PD patients in plasma, CSF or brain tissue. We plan to carry out a quantitative proteomic analysis using Somalogic SOMAscan® assay of plasma (n=600) and CSF (n=200) from clinically diagnosed PD patients and of brain tissue (n=200) from autopsy-confirmed PD patients. We will also evaluate CSF (n=740), plasma (n=410) and brain tissue (n=114) from an independent cohort of healthy individuals and CSF (n=275), plasma (n=234) and brain tissue (n=345) from AD patients. We expect to obtain precise and accurate levels of a large number of proteins across multiple tissues in the analyzed samples. Specific Aim 2: To prioritize candidate biomarkers based on an integrative analysis of proteomic and genome-wide genotyping data using Mendelian Randomization (MR). We plan to integrate proteomic and GWAS data to identify protein quantitative loci (pQTLs) and apply MR approaches to determine proteins involved in the causal pathway of PD. Using this approach, we will be able to select reliable PD biomarker candidates for validation. Specific Aim 3: To determine whether genetic and proteomic data improves biomarker specificity. We will ascertain whether combining proteomic and genomic data could increase biomarker accuracy. We expect to uncover a genome-proteome network that may provide a basis for novel approaches to diagnostic and pharmacotherapeutic applications in PD. Narrative Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorders in humans. Currently, there are no reliable, sensitive and specific biomarkers identified in PD to date.

"BrainStorm: Highly Extensible Software for Advanced Electrophysiology and MEG/EEG Imaging Project Summary Electrophysiological recordings in humans and animals play an essential role in developing an understanding of the human brain. Signal recording technology spans the entire scale from invasive microelectrode single-unit recordings, through mesoscale macroelectrode measures of local field potentials, to whole-brain monitoring through measurement of scalp potentials (EEG) and extracranial magnetic fields (MEG). Analysis of these data presents a host of challenges, from low level noise removal and artifact rejection to sophisticated spatio-temporal modeling and statistical inference. The multidisciplinary neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform this analysis and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data. This proposal describes our plans to continue to develop and support Brainstorm, open-source software that meets this need. Brainstorm is a Matlab/Java multi-platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows) software package for analysis and visualization of electrophysiological data. The software is extensively documented through a series of detailed tutorials and actively supported through a user forum and a mailing list. Over the past 8 years we have registered 16,000 distinct users, provided hands on instruction to 1,200 trainees, and the software has been used and cited in ~600 journal papers. Brainstorm includes tools for importing MEG/EEG, intracranial EEG, animal electrophysiology, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data from multiple vendors, extensive interactive features for data preprocessing, selection and visualization, coregistration to volume and surface MRIs and atlases, forward and inverse mapping of cortical current density, time-series and connectivity analysis, and a range of statistical tools. Data can be analyzed through a graphical interface or through scripted pipelines. The current proposal represents a plan to extend Brainstorm in a manner that leverages the unique features of our software and addresses important needs for large-scale data analysis. In this project we will continue to extend and support our software through the following three specific aims: (i) we will harness recent developments in distributed and shared data and high performance computing resources, together with standardization of data organization, to facilitate large-scale, reproducible analysis of electrophysiological data. (ii) We will also address the need for improved modeling resulting from the increasing use of both invasive recordings and direct brain stimulation through development of new modeling software for accurate computation of the intracranial electromagnetic fields produced by brain stimulation and neuronal activation. (iii) Finally, we will continue to add new functionality and to support the software through in-person training, online forums, documentation and other resources. Project Narrative Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) are absolutely non-invasive brain imaging tools, which provide information on the spatial distribution and precise temporal orchestration of human brain activity. In addition to basic neuroscience research, MEG and EEG can be also used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. The neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform these analyses and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data.

"Deep Learning Algorithms for FreeSurfer Abstract FreeSurfer is a tool for the analysis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) that has proven to be a flexible and powerful technology for quantifying the effects of many conditions, including numerous neurological disorders, on human brain anatomy, connectivity, vasculature, chemical composition, physiology and function. In the past 20 years, these open source tools have been developed to accurately and automatically segment an array of brain structures and have become the core analysis infrastructure for the Alzheimer’s Disease NeuroImaging Initiative (ADNI). In this project, we seek the resources to radically increase the speed, accuracy and flexibility of these tools, taking advantage of exciting new results in Deep Learning. This will enable us to more accurately quantify neuroanatomical changes that are critical to diagnosing, staging and assessing the efficacy of potential therapeutic interventions in diseases such as Alzheimer’s. This includes the generation of documentation, tutorials, unit tests, regression tests and system tests to harden the tools and make them usable by clinicians and neuroscientists, and finally the distribution and support of the data, manual labelings and tools to the more than 40,000 researchers that use FreeSurfer through our existing open source mechanism. In addition, we will analyze the entire Alzheimer’s Disease NeuroImaging Initiative dataset and return it for public release, including a set of manually labeled data that can be used to optimize Deep Learning tools for Alzheimer’s Disease over the next decade. Relevance Successful completion of the proposed project will increase the usability and accuracy of our publicly available segmentation tools, and open up new possibilities, such as integrating them into the MRI scanner and rapidly detecting Alzheimer’s-related changes. These new capabilities well enable other studies to significantly increase their ability to detect AD and other disease effects in research settings as well as phase II and phase III clinical trials due to the radical increase in speed of the new tools, enabling them to be applied to a diverse set of MRI contrasts and much larger datasets, rapidly and accurately. Further, they will allow rapid application of cutting-edge analyses to the ongoing Alzheimer’s Disease NeuroImaging Initiative dataset, improving the ability to extract early biomarkers of this devastating disease.",Deep Learning Algorithms for FreeSurfer,9970009,R01AG064027,"['Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Excision', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Label', 'Licensing', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Pattern', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'contrast imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'early detection biomarkers', 'flexibility', 'high resolution imaging', 'human disease', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'morphometry', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open source', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'skills', 'spatial relationship', 'support tools', 'tool', 'usability', 'web site', 'wiki']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,649026,551214295,-0.05542995230734873
"Reconstructions and Representations of Cerebral Cortex Project Summary This project will generate extensive new findings about cortical organization and connectivity in humans and nonhuman primates using high quality, multimodal datasets provided by our collaborators and by the young adult Human Connectome Project (YA-HCP). It will accelerate progress by freely sharing the resulting tools and experimental data with the scientific community. The first aim will provide a critically needed evaluation of non-invasive connectivity measures in relation to invasive anatomical tracers in macaque monkeys. Different methods for estimating fMRI-derived functional connectivity will be evaluated in order to determine which approach best correlates with `ground truth' tracer-based anatomical connectivity. This aim will also generate new insights about cortical evolution by comparing areal organization across humans, macaques, and marmosets using a novel approach in which areal features (myelin maps, resting-state networks, and identified homologous areas) constrain the registration between species. The second aim will focus on cortical organization in individual subjects using refined HCP-style analysis tools. It will optimize and evaluate intersubject alignment (using a recently developed Multimodal Surface Matching method) and individual-subject parcellation (using a machine learning based areal classifier). An important outcome will be recommendations of `best practice' for other projects that acquire less fMRI data than in the YA- HCP. These data will also be used to characterize individual variability of human cortical areas. For each of 180 areas, individual differences in size and topology (neighborhood relationships) will be examined for heritability and for symmetry across the two hemispheres. Additional analyses will reveal whether some areas are reproducibly absent in some individuals and whether `novel' areas are present in some subjects. The third aim is to enhance the capabilities of the Connectome Workbench visualization and analysis platform and the BALSA database that were introduced during previous grant periods. Enhancements to Connectome Workbench will: (i) enable non-invasive electrophysiological (MEG/EEG) and invasive neurophysiological data to be integrated with MRI data and atlas-based connectivity data (ii) facilitate interoperability across different atlases, (iii) improve interactive `HCP-style' analysis capabilities, and (iv) enable cortical layer-based analyses. Enhancements to the BALSA database include: (i) a WebGL-based web-viewer for interactive online visualization with special focus on the unique data generated by this project, (ii) an online spatial localization tool and (iii) support for uploading scene files to BALSA from 5 other software platforms besides Workbench. Relevance This project will evaluate the accuracy of noninvasive methods for estimating brain connectivity in humans and monkeys, compare areal organization across species, and characterize individual variability of cortical organization using a multimodal parcellation derived from the Human Connectome Project. Results will be shared via a state-of-the-art database that stores extensively analyzed data. These efforts will increase our understanding of normal human brain circuitry and organization and may ultimately contribute to better diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders.",Reconstructions and Representations of Cerebral Cortex,9995177,R01MH060974,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Callithrix', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'Heritability', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Injections', 'Link', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Myelin', 'Neighborhoods', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Physiological', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Reference Values', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical tool', 'anatomical tracing', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'computerized', 'connectome', 'denoising', 'design', 'functional MRI scan', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'young adult']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,650574,533594881,-0.0025242153050064166
"In-vivo MRI-based prediction of TDP43 pathology in aging ABSTRACT Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology, a primary protein abnormality in the rare diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, is now recognized as a common age-related neuropathology, detected at autopsy in approximately 50% of older persons. According to recent evidence, TDP43 pathology in aging is associated with more rapid cognitive decline and higher odds of dementia, above and beyond contributions from Alzheimer’s and other age-related neuropathologies. In spite of its high frequency and deleterious effects, TDP43 can only be diagnosed at autopsy, and there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging. The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging by combining multimodal MRI and pathology in the same older persons from large community cohorts. Specifically, we propose to a) train TDP43 classifiers using machine learning based on ex- vivo MRI measurements of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical brain characteristics of older persons, b) translate these classifiers in-vivo, and c) test them in-vivo using longitudinal clinical, in-vivo MRI, and pathology data on older adults enrolled without dementia. We have generated a unique ex-vivo and in-vivo multimodal MRI-pathology database within the infrastructure of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG17917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), two longitudinal, epidemiologic clinical- pathologic cohort studies of aging that recruit non-demented individuals and have high follow-up rates and high autopsy rates. Using our database, we have produced compelling preliminary results in support of our aims. First, we have demonstrated that ex-vivo brain MRI data can be linked to in-vivo MRI data. Second, we show that TDP43 pathology is related to specific brain MRI characteristics independent of other age-related pathologies. Third, we show high TDP43 classification performance (AUC=0.81) based on ex-vivo MRI features in persons with as well as without comorbid Alzheimer’s pathology (a common coexisting pathology). Fourth, we demonstrate that the confidence score obtained from ex-vivo MRI classification is linked to the progression of deposition of TDP43 pathology (i.e. TDP43 stages). Finally, we translated a preliminary ex-vivo TDP43 classifier for use in-vivo and demonstrated in a small sample that it has high in-vivo classification performance, and is independently associated with lower cognition. We propose to further develop and test this promising in-vivo MRI classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology is now recognized as a common and deleterious age-related neuropathology, however, there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging, and diagnosis is only possible at autopsy. The objective of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in older community- dwelling persons with and without dementia, based on a combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical characteristics of the brain. Successful completion of the proposed work will have broad immediate implications in refining participant selection in clinical trials, as well as long term implications in the advancement of translational research and targeted disease-specific therapeutic approaches.",In-vivo MRI-based prediction of TDP43 pathology in aging,9993218,R01AG064233,"['Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Autopsy', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'base', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'follow-up', 'frontotemporal lobar dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'in vivo', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'non-demented', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'recruit', 'religious order study', 'response']",NIA,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,655533,8894636,-0.013873572748319534
"Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification Project Abstract Motivation: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 500 million people. Children commonly develop CKD from urinary obstructive diseases and nephrotoxic therapies, and then suffer severe growth failure,  hypertension, cardiovascular risks, and neurocognitive deficits, and eventually end-stage kidney disease. Accurate renal function quantification will improve clinical management of hydronephrosis (1 in 100 babies) and  dosing/selection of chemotherapeutic regimens in oncology patients. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the biomarker of renal function, is derived from blood or urine tests. These tests only provide global GFR and are limited in accuracy, especially in children, and even more so in children with cancer. MRI offers superb anatomic delineation without ionizing radiation, and is thus ideal for pediatric kidney imaging. However, MRI has not been widely adopted for pediatric renal function evaluation due to lack of reliability and cumbersome workflow. These hurdles stem from the fact that the critical components required for global and regional GFR calculation, including high spatiotemporal resolution, plasma flow and arterial input function, are difficult to obtain, and that accurate image segmentation of kidneys (cortex and medulla) is labor intensive. Additionally, although the same contrast agent injection can be used for obstruction evaluation, certain areas of the kidney suffer from significant signal loss using standard MRI acquisition techniques due to high contrast agent concentrations. This project addresses these major challenges for automated comprehensive renal function evaluation in children. Approach: The project has three development aims, which are validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable novel free-breathing time-resolved 3D dynamic contrast enhanced MRI that simultaneously provides accurate GFR calculation and renal plasma flow. This is achieved by incorporating self-navigated motion compensation, fast acquisition with parallel imaging and compressed sensing, and phase-contrast flow imaging. The second aim is to develop multiple new image analysis methods to extract GFR and renal plasma flow (RPF) that  leverage novel flow data of Aim 1, as well as automated new machine-learning image processing techniques for the segmentation of kidneys and ultimately global and regional GFR calculation. In Aim 3, we will develop and integrate ultrashort-echo-time techniques to address the MRI signal loss due to T2* effects from high contrast concentration for patients with obstruction, and further incorporate motion compensation and accelerated  imaging methods to enable time-resolved high-resolution dynamic MRI for contrast washout kinetics analysis in the same MR exam. Aim 4 will determine the performance of these methods in a clinical setting. Significance: This work will lead to robust, automated comprehensive pediatric renal MRI for safer and more accurate renal function evaluation in children. The techniques will facilitate widespread application in the com- munity setting and permit robust evaluation of renal function, for both children and adults. Project Narrative Kidney diseases in children often stem from blockages of the urinary tract or toxicity from medications, such as antibiotics or chemotherapies. Kidney function quantification is crucial for clinical management of these children. This work will develop accurate and automated pediatric MRI for quantification of kidney function and diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction.",Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification,9852445,R01EB026136,"['3-Dimensional', '4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac Output', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Cone', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Hydronephrosis', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Obstruction', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Reflux', 'Regimen', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Renal Plasma Flow', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Urinary tract', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Venous', 'Work', 'antimicrobial drug', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'community setting', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast enhanced', 'data acquisition', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'kidney cortex', 'kidney imaging', 'loss of function', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pressure', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem', 'urinary', 'urinary tract obstruction', 'urologic']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,662001,560644462,-0.005843370401615708
"Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) PROJECT SUMMARY Cerebral cavernous angioma (CA) is a capillary microangiopathy affecting more than a million Americans, predisposing them to a premature risk of brain hemorrhage. Fewer than 200,000 cases who have suffered a recent symptomatic hemorrhage (SH) are most likely to re-bleed again with serious clinical sequelae, and are the primary focus of therapeutic development. Genetic mechanisms of CA have been extensively studied, and consequent signaling aberrations in the neurovascular unit. These include proliferative dysangiogenesis, blood- brain barrier hyperpermeability, inflammation and immune mediated processes, anticoagulant vascular domain, and gut microbiome-driven mechanisms. Plasma levels of molecules reflecting these mechanisms and measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage leak on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been correlated with CA hemorrhage in pilot studies. It would be desirable to optimize these biomarkers to accurately diagnose CASH, to prognosticate the risk of future SH, and to monitor cases after a bleed and in response to therapy. This would influence clinical management, and select higher risk cases for clinical trials. Additional candidate biomarkers are emerging from ongoing mechanistic and differential transcriptome studies, which would be expected to further enhance the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis and prediction of CASH. Weighed combinations of levels of plasma proteins and characteristic micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNA) may further strengthen biomarker associations. Plasma biomarkers may reflect (and potentially replace) more cumbersome and expensive imaging biomarkers for monitoring CA hemorrhage. We here assemble leading clinical CA researchers and propose to deploy advanced statistical and computational biology approaches (including supervised machine learning) for the integration of novel candidate biomarkers, rejecting non-correlated candidates, and determining the best clustering and weighing of combined biomarker contributions. In Specific Aim 1 we assess these biomarkers in a large CA cohort from multiple sites, to discover the best plasma biomarkers and validate them in sex, age and relevant clinical subgroups. In Specific Aim 2 we compare changes in MRI measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage with plasma biomarkers over time. In Specific Aim 3 we query the biomarkers in non-CA subjects, to identify potential confounders in the clinical context. This project leverages the synergy of established CA research consortia, and integrates analytic and computational biology expertise to develop blood tests for better CASH diagnosis and prognosis. The project tests a novel integrational approach of biomarker development in a mechanistically defined cerebrovascular disease with a relevant context of use. This approach is applicable to other neurological diseases with similar pathobiologic features. PROJECT NARRATIVE The project assembles leading cavernous angioma researchers with the aim of developing blood tests for the diagnosis and prediction of symptomatic brain hemorrhage, a critical clinical challenge in a disease affecting more than a million Americans. We further examine whether blood biomarkers can replace or enhance the accuracy of advanced imaging in association with lesional bleeding. The project tests a novel integrational approach of biomarker development in a mechanistically defined cerebrovascular disease, with a clinically relevant context of use.",Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH),10055845,R01NS114552,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anticoagulants', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cavernous Hemangioma', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'IL6 gene', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Iron', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Immunity', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Vascular Permeabilities', 'Vitamin D Deficiency', 'accurate diagnosis', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'candidate marker', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'data harmonization', 'disorder subtype', 'follow-up', 'gut microbiome', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microbiome', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurovascular unit', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'recruit', 'response', 'sex', 'statistics', 'supervised learning', 'support vector machine', 'synergism', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2020,689695,246330700,-0.0032975010401247065
"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burden of human disability.",Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia,9878098,R01DC011805,"['Affect', 'Biological Markers', 'Botulinum Toxins', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communication', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dystonia', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family history of', 'Focal Dystonias', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal muscle structure', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Occupational', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social isolation', 'Spasm', 'Spastic Dysphonias', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'disability', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'side effect', 'standard care', 'symptom management', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2020,696730,32639530,-0.013992010684703907
"Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders Project Summary/Abstract  Disorders of mood and psychosis such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar depression are  incredibly complex, influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, and the clinical characterizations are primarily based on symptoms rather than biological information. Current diagnostic approaches are based on symptoms, which overlap extensively in some cases, and there is growing consensus that we should approach mental illness as a continuum, rather than as a categorical entity. Since both genetic and environmental factors play a large role in mental illness, the combination of brain imaging and genomic data are poised to play an important role is clarifying our understanding of mental illness. However, both imaging and genomic data are high dimensional and include complex relationships that are poorly understood. To characterize the available information, we are in need of approaches that can deal with high-dimensional data exhibiting interactions at multiple levels (i.e., data fusion), while providing interpretable solutions (i.e., a focus on brain and genomic  networks). An additional challenge exists because the available data has mixed temporal dimensionality, e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do not change over time, brain structure changes slowly over time, while fMRI changes rapidly over time. To address these challenges, we introduce a new unified framework called flexible subspace analysis (FSA) that can automatically identify subspaces (groupings of unimodal or multimodal  components) in joint multimodal data. Our approach leverages the interpretability of source separation approaches and can include additional flexibility by allowing for a combination of shallow and ‘deep’ subspaces, thus  leveraging the power of deep learning. We will apply the developed models to a large (N>60,000) dataset of  individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum to evaluate the important question of disease categorization. We will compute fully cross-validated genomic-neuro-behavioral profiles of individuals including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of 1) standard categories from the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM), 2) data-driven subgroups, and 3) dimensional relationships. We will also evaluate the single subject predictive power of these profiles in independent data to maximize generalization. All methods and results will be shared with the community. The combination of advanced algorithmic approach plus the large N data  promises to advance our understanding of the nosology of mood and psychosis disorders in addition to providing new tools that can be widely applied to other studies of complex disease. Project Narrative  It is clear that mood and psychosis disorders, largely diagnosed without biological criteria, include a multitude of inter-related genetic and environmental factors. We propose to develop new flexible models to capture  multiscale (dynamic) brain imaging and genomics data, which we will use to study individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum using a large aggregated dataset including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of two dichotomous approaches (standard diagnostic categories and unsupervised/data-driven) as well as a  dimensional approach to diagnosis.",Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders,9889183,R01MH118695,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Property', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Work', 'base', 'bipolar patients', 'blind', 'connectome', 'data anonymization', 'data fusion', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'flexibility', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'independent component analysis', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'profiles in patients', 'psychiatric genomics', 'psychotic symptoms', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,698402,43632870,0.0063605906694138925
"Machine learning for fast motion compensated quantitative abdominal DCE-MRI Project Summary: Functional imaging with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) provides important physiological markers of permeability, perfusion and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), a measure of kidney function, without exposing patients to ionizing radiation. DCE-MR images are at the same time used for evaluation of anatomy. Functional markers from DCE-MRI, if computed accurately, would play a critical role in diagnosing and assessing the progression of a number of pediatric diseases including those compromising kidney function, liver diseases, tumors, and Crohn's disease. One of the most important applications of DCE-MRI is assessing kidney function (GFR) in hydronephrosis patients with obstruction. In the absence of GFR information, children who stand to benefit from immediate surgical reconstruction might be overlooked or delayed in receiving treatment, and those who might benefit from a more conservative approach (i.e., “watchful waiting”) might receive an unnecessary surgical intervention. While the current reference standard, nuclear renography (MAG3), yields some useful diagnostic information, it is slow, provides low resolution, does not offer anatomic detail, and delivers potentially harmful ionizing radiation. There is a clinical need for accurate computation of quantitative functional markers. Unfortunately, current methods of DCE-MRI in neonates and children are less than optimal, and therefore, DCE-MRI is underutilized in clinical practice. The technical challenges include insufficient temporal resolution to capture fast arterial input function (AIF) dynamics (which are required for accurate computation of quantitative markers), unavoidable respiratory motion and bulk motion (which reduce image quality and significantly lower the accuracy of parameter estimates), and a lack of robust, fast, automated post processing techniques for accurate computation of markers. Thus, there is an urgent, unmet need to develop a motion-compensated, high spatiotemporal resolution DCE-MRI method addressing these challenges. The primary objective of this exploratory, three-year study, is three-fold: first, to develop and evaluate a new bulk and respiratory motion-compensated, high spatiotemporal resolution DCE-MRI technique for accurate estimation of functional markers; second, to further improve the robustness and speed of DCE-MRI using a fast, deep learning (DL) technique with integrated temporal prior for the reconstruction of motion-compensated, higher quality, high temporal resolution images; and third, to develop an automatic quantitative analysis pipeline including segmentation and tracer kinetic model-fitting using DL techniques for fast, robust and accurate quantification of functional markers. The successful completion of these aims will provide new, clinically important abdominal imaging capabilities, with real-time, motion-compensated image reconstruction and reliable real-time parameter estimation from high temporal and spatial resolution DCE-MRI. This work will extend the usefulness of DCE-MRI to pediatric patients who are unable to remain still in the scanner, and eliminate the need for repeated scans and sedation in infants. ! !

"Reproducible imaging-based brain growth charts for psychiatry ABSTRACT Major psychiatric illnesses are increasingly understood as disorders of brain development, which has led to large-scale studies of youth that combine multi-modal neuroimaging with clinical phenotyping. Together, such data have emphasized the promise of objective ‘growth charts’ of brain development. However, synergies across major efforts remains unrealized due to use of different clinical instruments, different scanning protocols, challenges in informatics, and difficulties in data integration. In this proposal, we will overcome these obstacles by leveraging advances in multivariate harmonization and analysis techniques to build highly reproducible growth charts of human brain development. To do this, we will aggregate and harmonize eight existing large-scale developmental imaging studies, comprising over 10,000 participants between the age of 5- 24 (Aim 1). We will use this harmonized data to build generalizable indices of normal network brain development (Aim 2). Finally, developmental abnormalities within specific brain networks will be linked to dimensions of psychopathology (Aim 3). Critically, all code, data, and derived indices will be shared publicly, creating a massive new resource to accelerate research in the developmental neuroscience community (Aim 4). In sum, this proposal will have provide a new data resource, yield reproducible growth charts of brain development, and delineate novel mechanisms regarding the developmental basis of psychopathology in youth. RELEVANCE Psychiatric illnesses often begin in childhood, adolescence, or young adulthood, and are increasingly conceptualized as disorders of brain development. Reproducible growth charts of bran development are critical for understanding both normal brain development and abnormalities associated with diverse psychopathology.

"Towards Generating a Multimodal and Multivariate Classification Model from Imaging and Non-Imaging Measures for Accurate Diagnosis and Monitoring of Dementia in Parkinsons disease. PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of the proposed research is to identify the best predictive biomarkers of dementia in Parkinson’s disease (PDD) through a multimodal and multivariate statistical model utilizing both neuroimaging derived measures (diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI), resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI), and T1-weighted MRI measures) and non- imaging measures such as demographics (age, sex, years of education), clinical (disease duration and severity), genetics (LRRK2), and CSF-measures (Total Tau, β-Amyloid, α-synuclein). It is critical to identify biomarkers that can predict dementia in Parkinson’s disease (PD) as approximately 50-80% of PD patients develop PDD within twelve years of diagnosis. Identifying pathophysiology-based biomarkers that could identify PD patients at high risk for PDD reliably is critical for better prognostication, correct identification of PDD in its prodromal stage to recruit in new disease-modifying clinical trials, and better understanding the pathophysiological processes underlining PDD. The proposed project has two important components. The first component of the project is to understand the pathophysiological mechanism underlying PDD through sophisticated voxelwise dMRI-derived measures estimated using a multi-shell high angular and spatial resolution dMRI data acquisition, and understanding network-level white matter (WM)-derived structural connectivity and rsfMRI-derived functional connectivity in PDD. The second component of the project is to identify the biomarkers that predict PDD through multivariate statistical modelling by combining these sophisticated pathologically relevant neuroimaging measures with non-imaging measures (such as clinical, demographics, genetics, and CSF-measures). We will recruit demographically matched healthy controls (HC) along with demographically, disease duration, and disease severity matched PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), PD-non-MCI (PD-nMCI), and PDD for this project. We will acquire multi-shell dMRI data at three b-values, namely 500s/mm2, 1000s/mm2, and 2500s/mm2 with a high angular and spatial resolution and estimate various unbiased free-water (fiso) corrected Gaussian dMRI-derived measures along with non-Gaussian dMRI-derived measures such as diffusion kurtosis measures, and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging measures. We will further compare these measures between the groups to identify significant dMRI-derived measures separating the groups, and understanding the neuroanatomical correlates of these measures with various neuropsychological scores. Furthermore, we will estimate dMRI-derived structural connectivity and rsfMRI-derived functional connectivity to understand network-level discrepancies predicting PDD. These pathologically relevant neuroimaging measures will be further combined with various non-imaging measures through a novel machine learning algorithm to identify the comprehensive and best predictors of PDD. The tools developed in our proposal also has great potential for significantly advancing the understanding of other neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) thereby helping to understand AD- and PD-specific neuroanatomical changes predicting dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is highly relevant to public health because identification of the Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients at a high-risk for developing dementia (PDD) is critical for better prognostication, correct identification of PDD in its prodromal stage to recruit in new disease-modifying clinical trials, and to better understand the pathophysiological processes underlining PDD. The proposed project identifies the best predictive biomarkers for PDD through examining the comprehensive Gaussian and non-Gaussian diffusion-MRI (dMRI)-derived white matter (WM) changes predicting PDD, examining the network-level discrepancies predicting PDD derived from dMRI-derived whole-brain structural connectivity and resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI)-derived whole-brain functional connectivity, and developing a multivariate and multimodal statistical model by combining these sophisticated pathologically relevant neuroimaging measures with non-imaging measures such as clinical (disease duration and severity), demographics (age, sex, years of education), genetics (LRRK2), and CSF- measures (β-Amyloid, α-Synuclein, tau) to identify the best predictive biomarkers of PDD through machine learning approach.

"Ultra-high field GluCEST MRI and MRS in youth at risk for psychosis ABSTRACT: Psychosis commonly develops in adolescence or early adulthood. Malfunctioning neurotransmitter systems, such as glutamate, are implicated in the disease progression of psychosis. Changes in brain glutamate in psychosis likely have several sources, as such, many frontline antipsychotic medications indirectly target the glutamate system and alleviate clinical symptoms. Unfortunately, monitoring in vivo alterations of the glutamate system within the brain are spatially limited by traditional magnetic resonance techniques. But, recently a novel 7T MRI technique (GluCEST) has shown that brain glutamate levels are lower across the brain in youth on the psychosis spectrum and patients with schizophrenia as compared to typically developing youth. Here, we propose to extend this novel work to directly measure glutamate within the brain of patients at risk for developing psychosis. Thus, this proposal is motivated by the need to better understand associations of brain neurochemistry, structure and function in both normal development and during early psychosis. In this study, we seek to 1) compare measures of glutamatergic development across the cortex in a cohort of typically developing (TD) youth, those at-clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR) and individuals with frank psychosis (PSY); 2) associate changes in brain glutamate with age- and diagnosis- related structural network changes in those at risk for developing psychosis; and 3) to establish comparison data of glutamate measures at 7T MRI (1HMRS vs. GluCEST). We will recruit and follow 35 TD, CHR and PSY over the 5-year funding period. Imaging data will be acquired at 7T and analyses will leverage recent advances in network science and machine learning. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of glutamate hypofunction in psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis. RELEVANCE: Psychosis is a debilitating psychiatric condition. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in brain development, such as disruptions in brain glutamate, during youth produce symptoms of psychosis or psychosis risk may be critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing the great costs of psychosis to individuals and society at large.",Ultra-high field GluCEST MRI and MRS in youth at risk for psychosis,10050152,R01MH120174,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complement', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Dopamine', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamate Receptor', 'Glutamates', 'Glutamine', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Motor', 'N-Methylaspartate', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Protons', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'Youth', 'cohort', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'emerging adult', 'frontal lobe', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'high risk', 'in vivo', 'in vivo monitoring', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurochemistry', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'precision medicine', 'recruit', 'trend', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,794181,593605914,-0.012263727003894609
"High-definition, wide field of view corneal imaging The cornea is the primary focusing structure of our visual system. Infections and diseases in the tissue can impair vision and lead to blindness, even in eyes with intact neurosensory function. Corneal disease is one of the leading causes of visual deficiency and blindness in the world. Tissue evaluation is an important step for assessing the health of the donor cornea and its appropriateness for different types of placement, yet this process suffers from high subjectivity. High-definition corneal imaging is needed to assist in selection of the most appropriate tissue for transplant. Progress on this front would greatly serve public need, as the cornea is the most commonly transplanted tissue worldwide, with nearly 185,000 transplants annually. Thus, a more sensitive and quantitative method for objective evaluation of tissue at eye banks is needed. We have developed a 3D high-definition imaging instrument based on Gabor-Domain Optical Coherence Microscopy (GDOCM). Our SBIR Phase I research successfully accomplished all Aims and demonstrated the feasibility of quantitative assessment of corneal tissue over a large field of view with GDOCM. Our Phase I results demonstrated that GDOCM has the following key advantages over existing corneal imaging techniques, which include specular and confocal microscopy: 1) improved accuracy of tissue qualification with 4-10x increase in field of view that reduces sampling error – this will provides a truer assessment of the overall tissue characteristics; 2) ability to simultaneously measure corneal thickness, quantify endothelial cell density, and identify morphological variations due to corneal disease – this will lead to complete corneal evaluation in a single instrument; 3) leveraging machine learning innovations to minimize variability induced by users – this will result in a more objective evaluation; 4) enhanced 3D cellular-level imaging of thin translucent endothelial cells – this will enable a detailed understanding of cell viability. The results of the proposed Phase studies II will demonstrate that GDOCM can provide high-definition, 3D visualization of corneal structures with immediate commercial application for qualification of donor tissue in eye banks, and with a path to in vivo clinical imaging of patients with corneal disease. Current corneal evaluation methods employed at eye banks have limited field of view and/or insufficient resolution, and their results suffer from high subjectivity. We propose to commercialize a Gabor-domain optical coherence microscope to enable non-invasive, high-definition, wide field of view imaging in 3D for eye banks.","High-definition, wide field of view corneal imaging",10007064,R44EY028827,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Blindness', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Density', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell Viability Process', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye Banks', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Innovation Corps', 'International', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optics', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Patient imaging', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rights', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Errors', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissue Donors', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visual system structure', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinical imaging', 'commercial application', 'density', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo regeneration', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurosensory', 'novel', 'phase 2 study', 'programs', 'prototype', 'screening', 'three-dimensional visualization', 'tool', 'trend']",NEI,LIGHTOPTECH CORPORATION,R44,2020,795732,974517,-0.020193300386325084
"Neural substrates of diffusion imaging in cognitively aging rhesus monkeys 7. Abstract.  The ability to identify and follow-up neurobiological changes that occur during brain maturation and aging is not only fundamental to our understanding of cognition, but is also crucial for clinical studies that focus on either neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders, including clinical trials. While post-mortem studies provide data that are well characterized in terms of localized histological changes, these data can be limited due to their cross sectional nature and small samples sizes. In contrast, non-invasive in vivo imaging allows for the collection of longitudinal data in much larger populations, and is a more powerful tool to investigate life span trajectories of brain maturation and aging. Recent developments in neuroimaging have provided evidence for the relationship between imaging changes and cognitive aging in monkeys, and humans. Unfortunately, the cellular underpinnings of cognitive age are a subject of debate and hence the biological specificity of available imaging measures is not well established. More alarming, while older imaging measures still lack thorough validation, newer “more specific” measures that are being constantly introduced into clinical research are even further from validation. Over the past funding period, we have worked with a large repository of histological, cognitive and imaging legacy data from cognitively aging rhesus monkeys, testing the hypothesis that neuroinflammation and myelin degeneration play crucial roles in cognitive aging, and that neuroimaging biomarkers can reflect those biological processes. We propose to further our work in this direction, by proposing translational experiments that will include 1). acquiring new, high resolution “Human Connectome Project (HCP)” compatible imaging data, 2). Expand our neuroimaging by adding neuroinflammation- and myelin-specific PET radioligands, 3). Develop neuroimaging white matter-specific biomarkers of mild cognitive impairment- a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, and 4). Investigate biological underpinnings of sex differences in aging. This is enabled by a collaboration of three PIs, with unique and complementary expertise in MRI imaging, morphometry, neuroanatomy, immunohistochemistry and cognitive aging, and will be further facilitated by acquiring and analyzing behavioral, imaging, blood and post mortem data from a cohort of 24 rhesus monkeys of both sexes, 8 young adults (4 males and 4 females) and 16 old adults (8 males and 8 females, half diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)). The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system. 8. Project Narrative. The three PIs and their co-investigators propose a multidisciplinary study of cognitive aging in rhesus monkeys. We plan to acquire new, state of the art imaging data, and combine it with cognitive assessments, blood measures, and postmortem brain tissue to explore the biological underpinnings and establish the specificity of the imaging biomarkers to neurobiology of cognitive aging. The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many other clinical populations including neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases of central nervous system.",Neural substrates of diffusion imaging in cognitively aging rhesus monkeys,9988322,R01AG042512,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Anisotropy', 'Astrocytes', 'Autopsy', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cell Aging', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Female', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammation', 'Ligands', 'Longevity', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Monkeys', 'Myelin', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuroglia', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radio', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Specificity', 'Spin Labels', 'Stains', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Water', 'Work', 'age related', 'brain tissue', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'data acquisition', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'juvenile animal', 'male', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'morphometry', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodal data', 'myelin degeneration', 'myelination', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuroinflammation', 'radioligand', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'response', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter change', 'young adult']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,832266,327644200,-0.006744081530653596
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9926317,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'comorbidity', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit', 'response', 'reward processing', 'statistical and machine learning', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2020,838291,68331629,0.013658969907760079
"Cross-frequency coupling: its role in brain function and dysfunction Abstract  One of the high priority research areas listed in the BRAIN 2025 Report is a better understanding of the brain network dynamics across time and space from human electrophysiological recordings. The RFA-MH-20- 120 “BRAIN Initiative: Secondary Analysis and Archiving of BRAIN Initiative Data” specifically focuses on the use of large volumes of existing data stored in open access public databases. In the proposed studies, we will perform an innovative secondary analysis of existing intracranial EEG records from patients with medicine- resistant epilepsy collected during their presurgical evaluation. These records from public repositories would allow us to study dynamic interactions between hippocampal and neocortical structures during the development of pathological activity as well as during verbal memory tasks. We will use a novel and rapidly developing approach from the realm of machine learning algorithms namely, deep learning neural networks. Physiological mechanisms of memory formation and consolidation as well as pathophysiological mechanisms of epilepsy are poorly understood. The main hypothesis of this proposal is that physiological function and dysfunction of the hippocampal-neocortical system may have a common mechanism that depends on the dynamic interaction of electrophysiological oscillations in the system. Brain oscillations have been suggested to be involved in information transfer within and between brain networks by modulating neural excitability at different spatial and temporal scales. The interaction of oscillations across different time scales is referred to as ‘cross-frequency coupling’ and it represents a high-order structure in the functional organization of brain rhythms. Aberrant patterns of cross-frequency coupling may lead to memory dysfunction as well as facilitate the propagation of pathological activity. At present, the field does not have a mechanistically justified criterion to distinguish between physiological and pathological oscillations especially regarding their high-order interactions. We will study cross- frequency coupling during the interictal-ictal transition (Aim 1) and during successful and unsuccessful verbal memory performance (Aim 2) using Deep Learning algorithms. One of the study goals is to create a neural network capable of recognizing patterns of cross-frequency coupling as biomarkers of different physiological and pathological functional states of the brain. A comprehensive characterization of cross-frequency coupling would allow us to distinguish between physiological and aberrant forms of interaction between brain networks at different time scales. The study results will deepen our knowledge about the functional organization of brain rhythms and will provide a new method to recognize functional states from electrophysiological records of brain activity. This method will be applicable for a more accurate monitoring, diagnosis and treatment of memory impairments in neurological and mental disorders as well as for the development of new tools for seizure prediction and control. Public Health Relevance Statement  A better understanding of brain dynamics from human electrophysiological recordings will help us find new ways to treat neurological and mental disorders and the BRAIN Initiative encourages the secondary analysis of large amounts of existing data. The proposed study will analyze intracranial EEG records from human participants stored in public data repositories using artificial intelligence methods. The results will deepen our knowledge of brain function and dysfunction and will pave the way for the development of new methods to diagnose and treat brain disorders.",Cross-frequency coupling: its role in brain function and dysfunction,10008042,RF1MH123192,"['Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Neocortex', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research Priority', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Time', 'Training', 'cognitive process', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'machine learning algorithm', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'mind control', 'neocortical', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural network', 'new technology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'public repository', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'tool']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,839700,50343425,0.012079854930148732
"Blood mitochondrial DNA biomarkers of midlife cognitive decline and adverse brain imaging changes - A longitudinal investigation in the CARDIA population‐based cohort study SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRDs) are typically the result of neurodegenerative processes that begin 15-20 years before clinical diagnosis. Despite this lengthy subclinical phase and advances in early diagnostic technologies including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, brain MRIs, and positron emission tomography (PET) measures there are no scalable biomarkers to identify individuals with preclinical disease, which may offer the best time window for intervention. Specifically, because brain MRI and PET tests are resource-intensive and CSF sampling is invasive, there is urgent need for biomarkers based on blood samples, which can be non-invasively collected even in centers lacking highly specialized technology. The mitochondrial genome (mtDNA), unlike the stable nuclear genome, is dynamic and accumulates somatic mutations over the lifespan. Mutations in the mtDNA can be induced by oxidative stress and lead to declining mitochondrial function as we age; in turn, less functional mitochondria generate higher levels of oxidative stress, which induces chronic inflammation and tissue injury in specific organs including the brain. Yet, no study has investigated mtDNA mutations as early predictors of ADRD. We hypothesize that individuals with higher levels and faster accumulation of blood mtDNA mutations have greater cognitive decline and preclinical ADRD brain imaging changes during midlife, and that these mtDNA biomarkers will predict ADRD diagnosis in older adults. We will test our hypotheses by leveraging the NHLBI-funded Coronary Artery Risk Development In young Adults (CARDIA) study. CARDIA is a multicenter, community-based, longitudinal cohort that recruited 5,115 black and white young adults (mean age 25 years), followed them up at least every five years, and is preparing to conduct its examination Year 35 (Y35) visit in 2020/21 (mean age 60 years) when over 3,000 participants are expected to return. We will use state-of-the-art deep sequencing technology to measure mtDNA mutations in CARDIA blood samples collected at Y15, Y25, and Y35. In Aim 1, we will determine whether higher levels of mtDNA mutations and their accumulation over time are associated with greater cognitive decline in midlife. In Aim 2, we will determine whether mtDNA mutations are associated with structural, physiological, and functional MRI phenotypes of preclinical ADRD as well as with sensitive MRI-based markers of accelerated brain aging and preclinical ADRD constructed by our team using contemporary machine learning techniques. Finally, in Aim 3, we will test the clinical utility of these mtDNA mutation biomarkers in identifying individuals at risk of future ADRD in four older cohorts that have large numbers of longitudinally identified, clinically-diagnosed ADRD. Our focus on longitudinal measures of blood mtDNA, cognitive function, and MRI changes over a 10- year period during midlife, combined with characterization of their clinical utility in older populations, is highly innovative. If successful, our study may help initiate possible future interventions in early midlife and reduce the public health and medical burden of AD and dementia. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT This study has high potential for characterizing novel blood-based biomarkers to identify preclinical ADRD and test their utility in predicting clinical ADRD. No other study has a similar design with repeated blood mtDNA mutations, cognitive assessments, and brain imaging data during midlife, a critical time window for interventions to prevent clinical ADRD development. By also using data from four large cohorts of older adults, we can determine the clinical utility of these mtDNA biomarkers to predict clinical ADRD and move the field closer toward the NIH’s goal of personalized health interventions.",Blood mitochondrial DNA biomarkers of midlife cognitive decline and adverse brain imaging changes - A longitudinal investigation in the CARDIA population‐based cohort study,10055446,R01AG069120,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Mutation', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nuclear', 'Older Population', 'Organ', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Solid', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging brain', 'base', 'blood-based biomarker', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'deep sequencing', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome sequencing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'middle age', 'mitochondrial DNA mutation', 'mitochondrial genome', 'novel', 'population based', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'tissue injury', 'tool', 'whole genome', 'young adult']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,852784,558628098,-0.02901645530022526
"BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR) To take advantage of recent and ongoing advances in intensive and large-scale computational methods, and to preserve the scientific data created by publicly funded research projects, data archives must be created as well as standards for specifying, identifying, and annotating deposited data. The value of and interest in such archives among researchers can be greatly increased by adding to them an active computational capability and framework of analysis and search tools that support further analysis as well as larger scale meta-analysis and large scale data mining. The OpenNeuro.org archive, begun as a repository for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, is such an archive. We propose to build a gateway to OpenNeuro for human electrophysiology data (EEG and MEG, as well as intracranial data recorded from clinical patients to plan brain surgeries or other therapies) – herein we refer to these modalities as neuroelectromagnetic (NEM) data. The Neuroelectromagnetic Data Archive and Tools Resource (NEMAR) at the San Diego Supercomputer Center will act as a gateway to OpenNeuro for NEM data research. Such data uploaded to NEMAR at SDSC will be deposited in the OpenNeuro archive. Still- private NEM data in OpenNeuro will, on user request, be copied to the NEMAR gateway for further user processing using the XSEDE high-performance resources at SDSC in conjunction with The Neuroscience Gateway (nsgportal.org), a freely available and easy to use portal to use of high-performance computing resources for neuroscience research. Publicly available OpenNeuro NEM data will be able to be analyzed by running verified analysis applications on the OpenNeuro system. In this project we will build an application to evaluate the quality of uploaded NEM data, and another to visualize the data, for EEG and MEG at both the scalp and brain source levels, including time-domain and frequency-domain dynamics time locked to sets of experimental events learned from the BIDS- and HED-formatted data annotations. The NEMAR gateway will take a major step toward applying machine learning methods to a large store of carefully collected and stored human electrophysiologic brain data to spur new developments in basic and clinical brain research. The NEMAR gateway to the OpenNeuro.org human neuroimaging data archive will build tools to add human electrical and magnetic brain activity records to the archive, to evaluate its quality for users and visualize its features. The resulting facility will allow applications of new machine learning methods to research on human brain dynamics that can be expected to lead to breakthroughs in understanding how the human brain supports our awareness and behavior in both health and disease.",BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR),9985198,R24MH120037,"['Archives', 'Awareness', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Deposition', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetism', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scalp structure', 'Science', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spottings', 'Staging', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'brain research', 'brain surgery', 'built environment', 'computational platform', 'computerized data processing', 'computing resources', 'cyber infrastructure', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data archive', 'data curation', 'data format', 'data mining', 'data quality', 'data structure', 'data submission', 'data tools', 'hackathon', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'machine learning method', 'neuroimaging', 'preservation', 'repository', 'response', 'sensor', 'structured data', 'supercomputer', 'support tools', 'tool', 'tool development', 'web interface', 'web services', 'web site']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R24,2020,900723,524978793,0.02772148709170056
"Comprehensive Multivariable Deep Learning Models to Identify Predictors of Cognitive Change in PD PROJECT SUMMARY Cognitive impairment and Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) are well-established disorders in Parkinson’s disease (PD) which are debilitating and contribute to increased mortality. The course, severity, and rate of progression of cognitive symptoms in PD is variable and unpredictable. Some patients develop PDD within the first several years of diagnosis, while others remain cognitively intact or have a milder form of impairment for many years after diagnosis. This heterogeneity in impairment profile and risk to PDD likely reflects the diverse underlying pathophysiological mechanisms associated with PD progression and cognitive dysfunction. The combination of diverse pathological features and clinical phenotypes makes it challenging to inform patients what to expect during the course of disease, and is a substantial barrier to developing new drugs for cognitive impairment in PD. Therefore, developing prognostic markers of risk of cognitive progression in PD is important. Our overall hypothesis is that different combinations of biomarkers will be more informative in predicting cognitive progression compared to a single biomarker alone. Thus, our objective is to investigate multivariable data to identify unique clinical-molecular-imaging biomarker signatures that identify individuals with PD who are most likely to experience substantial cognitive changes that ultimately lead to PDD. To achieve our objective, we will first develop deep learning models that identify multivariable features that are prognostic of incident mild cognitive impairment in people with early-stage PD (aim 1). Next, we will develop deep learning models that identify multivariable features that are prognostic of either (a) conversion from mild cognitive impairment to PDD (aim 2); or, (b) reversion from mild cognitive impairment to cognitively intact PD (aim 3). Finally, we will develop deep learning models that identify prognostic markers of rapid cognitive deterioration in PD leading to PDD (aim 4). For the development of the proposed models, this project will take advantage of a large repository of clinical data available at the Center for Health + Technology (CHeT) at the University of Rochester. The modeling will be carried out at the University of Rochester Data Science Consortium (RDSC) by an experienced team of data scientists that will use multimodal temporal convolution network models. A multidisciplinary team that includes neurologists, pharmacologists, and data scientists will support model execution and the interpretation of the modeling results. The expected outcomes of the efforts from this research are comprehensive multivariable prognostic markers of cognitive progression in PD across different stages of disease, from mild impairment to PDD that will add novel insight into disease process. NARRATIVE Deep learning will be used to construct models of cognitive progression in Parkinson’s disease (PD) from multiple data modalities. The models will assess and evaluate the potential impact of clinical, biosamples, genetics, and imaging variables on the progression to mild cognitive impairment and dementia, as well as on rates of cognitive progression. These models will identify markers and their combinations that are prognostic to distinct cognitive progression trajectories in PD.",Comprehensive Multivariable Deep Learning Models to Identify Predictors of Cognitive Change in PD,10052031,RF1NS115141,"['Address', 'Age', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Goals', 'Health Technology', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologist', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Talents', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'advanced analytics', 'care costs', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive disability', 'cognitive impairment in Parkinson&apos', 's', 'convolutional neural network', 'data warehouse', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'molecular imaging', 'mortality', 'motor disorder', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'progression marker', 'sex']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,RF1,2020,1155000,179705973,-0.005257193059682699
"Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD Overall Summary The overarching goal of the proposed center is to leverage molecular and circuit biomarkers to advance the understanding of mechanisms and personalized treatment of topiramate treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder comorbid with PTSD. We propose an integrative translational focus on alterations in excitatory and inhibitory signaling, focusing on GABA and glutamate and related circuitry, to model the neurobiology of PTSD comorbid with PTSD and the mitigating effects of topiramate. We will characterize excitatory and inhibitory molecular markers in an animal model of AUD comorbid with PTSD, utilizing genomic markers in the brain and plasma markers in rodents. In clinical trial participants we will characterize excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signaling by ascertaining plasma markers, GRIK 1 genotype and neural circuit markers utilizing TMS evoked potentials in EEG, task-based functional MRI and MR spectroscopy. This goal will be achieved through the activities of three research projects supported by two research cores, the administrative core and the Scientific Advisory Board (Figure1). In Project 1 lead by Silvia Fossati Ph.D. and Jorge Manzanares Robles Ph.D. we will study the behavioral and molecular effects of two doses of topiramate vs. vehicle in animal models of AUD alone, PTSD alone and AUD+PTSD. In Project 2 lead by Michael Bogenschutz M.D. and Joshua Lee M.D. we will study the behavioral, genetic and plasma biomarker effects of topiramate vs. placebo in 150 participants with co-occurring AUD and PTSD. In project 3 lead by Amit Etkin M.D., Ph.D. and Charles R. Marmar M.D. we will ascertain multi-modal imaging markers including task based fMRI, TMS evoked potentials in EEG and MRS. Imaging markers will be used to characterize excitatory and inhibitory circuits in Project 2 clinical trial participants with AUD+PTSD to determine predictors and mechanisms of topiramate vs. placebo treatment outcomes. Plasma biomarkers in Project 2 will be related to the same or homologous plasma biomarkers in Project 1. Circuit markers from Project 3 will be related to genomic markers in the same or homologous brain regions in Project 1. The Biofluids Biomarker Core (BBC) lead by Dr. Fossati will support collection of plasma biomarkers (GABA, glutamate, HPA axis, neuropeptides, neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress) in animals in Project 1 and clinical trial participants in Project 2. The Analytics and Biostatistics Core (ABC) lead by Eugene Laska Ph.D. and Carole Segal Ph.D. will support experimental design, formulation of hypothesis, power calculations, and data integrity, management and analysis for Project 1, 2 and 3, implementing advanced statistical models for individualized prediction of response to topiramate in Project 1 and Project 2. Overall Narrative We aim to advance personalized topiramate treatment for comorbid AUD and PTSD by focusing on network excitatory and inhibitory imbalances underlying heightened negative emotions and impairments in executive function and emotion regulation. Excitatory and inhibitory targets will be assessed with brain, plasma and circuit markers, where possible harmonizing the approach for optimizing discovery of mechanisms and prediction of topiramate treatment in animal models and in clinical trial participants. We will achieve this aim with a center driven approach to discovery with three integrative design elements and four cross-project center aims, creating translational bridges among animal model, clinical trial and imaging studies.",Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD,9996319,P01AA027057,"['Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Data Analytics', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Equilibrium', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Formulation', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Placebos', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol comorbidity', 'alcohol cue', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical trial participant', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'comorbidity', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'design', 'drinking', 'dual diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'genomic biomarker', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'response', 'source localization', 'topiramate', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIAAA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,P01,2020,1202772,329565273,-0.002541912712668321
"Mapping human brain perivascular space in lifespan using human connectome project data PROJECT SUMMARY Perivascular spaces are a critical component of the glia-lymphatic circuit, facilitating the clearance of soluble waste. The role of perivascular spaces and changes in the brain’s clearance system in normal development, aging, and cognition is not fully understood, mainly due to lack of neuroimaging capabilities. However, noninvasive in vivo mapping of the perivascular space fluid with high accuracy and reliability is now made possible with our recent analytical developments, using human connectome project (HCP) data. The objective of this project is to map structural and diffusion features of perivascular space fluid across lifespan. PVS features include PVS presence (e.g., count and volume fraction) and diffusion (e.g., diffusivity and anisotropy). These features will be extracted regionally and globally across the brain. Structural MRI will provide information regarding localization and extent of the PVS and diffusion MRI will be used to investigate biophysical properties of the PVS fluid and surrounding tissue. The central hypothesis is that the perivascular space fluid increases across lifespan. We also hypothesize that individual differences exist in perivascular spaces as a function of demographic, general health and lifestyle health choices, such as body mass index, blood pressure, tobacco use and sleep quality. The central hypothesis will be tested by characterizing the normative map of the perivascular space fluid across the lifespan and in relation to various demographic, cognitive measures, and health factors. We will also examine whether subjects neuro-behavioral performances can be predicted by perivascular space features. We will pursue these aims by applying innovative MRI-based computational techniques that we recently developed and optimized on HCP data. We will also use Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Studies to build first normative template of PVS in neurodevelopment. Together, our findings will ultimately allow for a better understanding of the human brain clearance system, and our shared perivascular space mapping workflow can provide a resource for researchers to study a wide range of neurological conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is expected to fill our gap knowledge regarding the role of the clearance system in brain health and cognition and its neuroimaging signature. We will identify and provide access to quantitative morphological and diffusion features of brain glia-lymphatic network to the larger scientific community to help facilitate our understanding of what role the brain clearance system has across lifespan.

"High throughput assaying of circuit activity and connectivity in brain organoids Experimental models of the human developing brain are needed to investigate human-specific aspects of brain development, evolution, and neurological disease. Progress in the field has been hampered by the lack of models, considering that the endogenous developing human brain cannot be directly investigated; animal models often fail to recapitulate human disorders and cannot feasibly be used to study complex polygenic states spanning many genes. While reductionist in nature, stem-cell derived 3D human brain organoids offer a first-of- its-kind opportunity to study processes of human brain formation and wiring that are otherwise not accessible. However, there is an unmet need for organoid models that are cellularly complete and reproducible and for methodology to decode the establishment, connectivity and dynamics of neural circuits in organoids, at scale and with high fidelity. If we could map the activity and connectivity of organoids at scale, both to understand circuit function/dysfunction and to guide further development of organoids, we could close the loop on organoid design and application. Towards this goal, we have developed many molecular and imaging tools for high-throughput analysis of neural activity and connectivity, which we propose to apply to new, next-generation organoid models. Here, we propose a collaborative approach among four groups (Arlotta - brain organoids and human brain development; Boyden - circuit physiology and neural imaging technology; Lewis - material science and bioengineering and Insoo Hyun- bioethics) to pioneer a robust organoid system that combines the development of vascularized brain organoids incorporating more complete cell diversity and maturation with advanced high-throughput functional molecular and imaging tools to enable interrogation of circuit activity, connectivity, and molecular changes in cells participating in physiologically relevant circuits. We will build on a highly reproducible brain organoid model that we recently developed to promote the generation of cell types that are currently absent in organoids but needed for circuit maturation, refinement, and functionality. This work is intended to generate more advanced organoid models designed to promote maturation and robust network activity. In parallel, we will develop a pipeline to record neural activity from intact organoids using all- optical-electrophysiology techniques at scale, and optimize epitope-based barcoding and expansion microscopy to enable molecularly-annotated connectomics of brain organoids. The work proposed here will enable the use of human organoid models to study human circuit formation, plasticity, and function, analyses that are currently hampered by the lack of technologies and assays for high-throughput measurements of circuit physiology and connectivity in organoids. Beyond the work proposed here, these methods will directly enable investigation into how disease states alter information processing in the brain; for example, linking mutations in disease-associated genes with specific abnormalities in human neurons and circuits to inform the identification of molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. Project Narrative  Neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders affect millions worldwide and are of enormous public health significance; however, we have a very limited understanding of the molecular, cellular and circuit-level abnormalities underlying these diseases. Progress in the field has been hampered by the lack of research models, given that animal models often fail to recapitulate the human disease, and that, while 3D human brain organoids offer experimental access to processes of human brain formation and wiring, methodology is needed to decode circuit function and connectivity in organoids, at scale and with high fidelity.

"Epidemiologic Study of Neural Reserve and Neurobiology of Aging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Extensive progress was made in the previous funding period of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). We 1) elucidated the neuropathologic basis of cognitive decline due to Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD), 2) discovered genomic, experiential, psychological, and medical risk factors for ADRD clinical and pathologic traits including numerous risk factors for Alzheimer’s dementia with little to no relationship with ADRD brain pathologies, and 3) identified numerous potential novel therapeutic targets for cognitive decline, especially targets for cognitive decline not explained by common brain pathologies i.e., resilience. Here, the average person has average resilience and individuals can be more or less resilient. Resilience is a high value therapeutic target because if druggable it would offset the effects of any combination of brain pathologies. In this funding cycle, we propose to continue to follow MAP participants and conduct autopsies, and in this cycle, to obtain skin biopsies at autopsy to support a powerful new drug discovery program that integrates existing brain omics data with a new human cellular model of disease, i.e., skin derived fibroblast cultures induced into neuronal lines from persons with more or less resilience. We propose to: 1) define a robust and specific molecular signature of resilience in the human brain; 2) identify gene targets of resilience and establish human low-resilience cell models derived from MAP participants of known resilience; and 3) conduct drug discovery screens in the low-resilience models to identify compounds that increase resilience. These aims are supported by compelling preliminary work. An Exploratory Aim will continue to identify risk factors for ADRD clinical and pathologic traits leveraging the rich resource generated from the exposure data, repeated measures, and neuropathologic traits . All aims will examine sex as a biologic variable. A Secondary Aim will continue to share the unique and valuable resources generated by MAP including the to-be-generated fibroblast cell lines with the scientific community. Harnessing mechanisms of resilience to ADRD can slow down or prevent cognitive decline regardless of the presence and complexity of common brain pathologies. Therefore, the genes and compounds identified from our study will provide new therapeutic remedies to boost brain reserve in combating ADRD-related dementia. We believe that the proposed continuation will have a high and sustained impact on the field of aging and dementia research. POJECT NARRATIVE/PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The identification of novel therapeutics to prevent of cognitive decline, MCI and Alzheimer’s dementia is a major public health priority. Resilience is a high value therapeutic target with the potential to maintain cognition regardless of the type and number of brain pathologies. The proposed continuation of MAP will identify genes and compounds that affect a molecular signature of resilience in a novel human cell model of disease from autopsied MAP partic ipants .",Epidemiologic Study of Neural Reserve and Neurobiology of Aging,10018624,R01AG017917,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Autopsy', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Screening', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts', 'Funding', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Persons', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Skin', 'Source', 'Work', 'apolipoprotein E-3', 'base', 'combat', 'data hub', 'drug discovery', 'epidemiology study', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'human model', 'in silico', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'neuropathology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'sex', 'therapeutic target', 'trait']",NIA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,3035766,55098220,-0.02116096996860138
"Aging eyes and aging brains in studying alzheimer's disease: Modern ophthalmic data collection in the adult changes in thought (ACT) study PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT The overarching goals of this R01 proposal are to improve scientific understanding of potential mechanisms by which ophthalmic diseases lead to the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. The investigators will leverage modern ophthalmic data with state-of-the-art imaging and extensive archived clinical data from a well-characterized cohort of older adults. The investigators propose to examine the effect of structural and functional changes in retina and longitudinal severity of ophthalmic diseases on Alzheimer’s disease and related neuropathology. The proposal builds on the resources of the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study, a prospective longitudinal, population-based, dementia-free cohort of over 5,500 people to date established in 1994 which has detected >1,014 research quality diagnoses of Alzheimer’s disease and >1,254 dementia to date. ACT follows consenting participants to autopsy and has performed state-of-the arts autopsy on >781 decedents to date. In this extremely well-characterized cohort, the investigators found that several ophthalmic diseases (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration) are significantly associated with the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. The investigators will use three advanced ophthalmic imaging modalities at both home and clinical research study visits: fundus photography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and OCT angiography (OCTA), to obtain quantitative data relevant to these ophthalmic diseases. The study team will establish the distribution (Aim 1a) and 2- and 4-year evolution of ophthalmic imaging characteristics found in older adults in the community and determine associations with change in cognition (Aim 1 b, c). Additionally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI angiography (MRA) will be obtained in a subset of participants to investigate the contribution of small (retinal) and large (cerebral) vascular disease towards cognitive changes (Aim 1d). The study team will continue ACT study’s strong commitment for meaningful data sharing. In collaboration with the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging at University of Southern California, the study team will promulgate these ophthalmic data in addition to neuroimaging data to the research community (Aim 1e). In Aim 2, the investigators will use extensive clinical ophthalmology data captured over many decades and incorporate them in novel longitudinal models of eye disease severity. The investigators will analyze eye disease severity along with extensive neuropathology data from the ACT study, including both standard (Aim 2a) and novel quantitative (Aim 2b) neuropathology data, to further scientific understanding of neuropathological mechanisms underlying associations between eye conditions and Alzheimer’s disease risk. The brain is not amenable to direct observations during life. In contrast, the eye is an anterior extension of the central nervous system and may provide a valuable window to illuminate neurodegenerative processes in the aging brain. Proposed investigations will substantially enhance scientific understanding of the role of modern ophthalmic evaluations in delineating risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of neuropathology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Using a large, well-characterized, longitudinal, prospective, cohort study, the study team previously found that diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration were significantly associated with Alzheimer’s disease risk. The team proposes to use three cutting edge ophthalmic imaging modalities to obtain quantitative data at both home and clinic research study visits in addition to MRI and MRA in a subset of participants to evaluate their associations with change in cognition over time (Aim 1). The team will leverage extensive ophthalmic clinical and neuropathological data already available for 781 study participants to date as well as new state-of-the-art quantitative measures of beta amyloid (Aβ1-42) and phosphorylated tau to elucidate mechanisms underlying associations between ophthalmic conditions and Alzheimer’s disease (Aim 2).",Aging eyes and aging brains in studying alzheimer's disease: Modern ophthalmic data collection in the adult changes in thought (ACT) study,10005108,R01AG060942,"['Adult', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Angiography', 'Anterior', 'Archives', 'Autopsy', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drusen', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Fundus photography', 'Ganglion Cell Layer', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neuraxis', 'Occipital lobe', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Selection Bias', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'aging brain', 'area striata', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis quality', 'epidemiology study', 'fiber cell', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'paired helical filament', 'population based', 'prospective', 'public repository', 'research study', 'resilience', 'tau Proteins', 'tau-1', 'vascular contributions']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,3349913,533302350,-0.057357419912189504
"Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior Project Summary / Abstract High-throughput experimental neuroscience has made it possible to observe behavior of many animals, as well as a large groups of neurons simultaneously, providing an exciting opportunity for figuring out how the neural system performs computations that underlie perception, cognition, and behavior. However, there is a major bottleneck in the scientific cycle of data analysis and data collection due to the complexity and scale of noisy, high-dimensional data. The primary objective of this project is to develop tools for tracking the internal state of the brain that are not directly measurable from both the behavior and neural signals, and to generate optimal stimulus corresponding to the current brain state. These external stimuli can be used to perturb the animal’s belief or strategy about the world such that the animal would behave differently. Aim 1: Our team will develop a neural state tracking system that will parse out and display complex neural signals recorded from the animal brain in real-time. The neural state tracking algorithm will also extract the law that the neural system operates under, allowing neuroscientist to generate a new class of hypotheses about the population level implementation underlying intelligent behavior. Aim 2: To causally test hypothesis on how population of neurons compute and produce meaningful behavior, it is necessary to be able to perturb the internal computation process. We will develop a feedback control system to perturb the neural dynamics at a short time scale with a novel control scheme for neural computation that respects the brain’s own degrees of freedom. Aim 3: By understanding and tracking the time evolution of internal strategy throughout learning, we can learn how to optimize the training of animal behavior. In this aim, we will develop statistical models of learning and a computational system to generate the best stimuli based on the past performance of the animal. The statistical tools developed in this project will likely accelerate fundamental discoveries in neuroscience. Clinically, this research can extend to monitoring, diagnosing, and building next- generation real-time feedback stimulation devices for disorders with a neurodynamic or behavioral component such as Parkinson’s disease, autism, learning disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, and epilepsy. We will develop new tools to train animals faster for further experiments, and to understand inner  workings of animal brains. These tools will visualize how the internal states change over time as  it happens while the animal is engaged in simple behavior.",Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior,9789318,R01EB026946,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Closure by clamp', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lateral', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Learning Disorders', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operating System', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Scheme', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'multidimensional data', 'neglect', 'neurotransmission', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2019,7509,77607041,0.010990040667500789
"Application of Advanced Quantitative Methods to Schizophrenia Research in Macedonia PROJECT SUMMARY  Abnormalities of white matter are important in schizophrenia. A preponderance of studies have found decreased levels of transcripts for myelin-related proteins in autopsy brains. Some have found decrease in the proteins themselves, and some have not. Hundreds of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have found reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in the brains of many people with schizophrenia (SCH). Decreased FA is interpreted as disruption of normal architecture. However, postmortem examination has failed to identify characteristic abnormalities. This suggests that abnormalities are subtle, and perhaps postmortem examinations have not used the right tools to find them. We have therefore been developing, as part of a collaboration supported by our concluding Fogarty project, two new methods to characterize white matter at high resolution. The first is a machine learning protocol to measure axonal diameters and myelin sheath thickness in electron microscope (EM) images of prefrontal white matter, recognizing and avoiding artifacts in EM of autopsy tissue. This will enable us to measure thousands of fibers in EM images produced as part of our concluding Fogarty project, from individuals with SCH, major depressive disorder (MDD), or no psychiatric illness (NPI). The second method, suggested by the DTI findings, is to analyze the arrangement of the axons themselves. We will use 3-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of high-resolution images of the axons themselves, identified by Bielschowsky silver stain or immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated neurofilament protein. To obtain high-resolution images of Bielschowsy stains, we will take advantage of the recent observation by Dr. Mark Sonders, co-investigator on this project, that these and other heavy metal stains luminesce under 2-photon infrared excitation. This yields clear and measurable images of individual axons. We will perform these procedures on sections from existing paraffin blocks that comprise a complete left prefrontal coronal section from 36 triads containing 1 case each of SCH, MDD, or NPI, matched for sex and age. These brains were included in earlier studies that yielded data on protein composition, mRNA for myelin-related proteins, DNA methylation, microglial activation, and semiquantitative myelin histology. In a third, exploratory aim, we will employ graphical models to combine these various types of data with known properties of CNS white matter and myelin to build a model of what is disturbed in schizophrenia. We expect that novel techniques for data fusion will reveal associations based on multidimensional correlations that could not be detected by modeling the single-domain datasets separately. In the process of completing these scientific aims, we will pursue the pedagogic goals of training the first two professional biostatisticians in Macedonia, and an academic pathologist. We will also hold a seminar course for biological researchers to build awareness and understanding of the power of biostatistical and other computational methods to enrich their research. NARRATIVE Our ongoing Fogarty/NIMH research project in Macedonia (R01 MH060877, “Building Schizophrenia Research in Macedonia”), has demonstrated biochemical abnormalities of white matter in schizophrenia that are not present in major depressive disorder. However, we have not seen anatomical abnormalities of white matter, which MRI studies of schizophrenia tell us should exist, and as the biochemistry also suggests. To explore white matter in novel ways, we are developing new methods of microscopy, image analysis and statistical inference, which we now propose to employ on a large scale.",Application of Advanced Quantitative Methods to Schizophrenia Research in Macedonia,9953486,R56MH117769,"['3-Dimensional', 'Academy', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Autopsy', 'Awareness', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscope', 'Electrons', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Macedonia', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Multiomic Data', 'Myelin', 'Myelin Sheath', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurofilament Proteins', 'Paraffin', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Silver Staining', 'Stains', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structural Models', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translational Research', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'deep neural network', 'diffusion anisotropy', 'high resolution imaging', 'histological image', 'histological studies', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'interest', 'low and middle-income countries', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'novel', 'pedagogy', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'tool', 'two photon microscopy', 'two-photon', 'water diffusion', 'white matter']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R56,2019,10000,68331629,-0.02900851040180945
"A novel multi-modal, multi-scale imaging pipeline for the validation of diffusion MRI of the brain Project Summary  In this project, we propose to validate and characterize ﬁber orientation estimation from diffusion tensor imag- ing (DTI) through the optimization of a multi-modality, multi-scale imaging pipeline for whole mouse brains. DTI is a powerful tool used to noninvasively report 3D microstructural properties of nervous tissue on a macroscopic scale, and has played an important role in the understanding and diagnosis of a number of neurological disease processes. Modern acquisitions of DTI data can be processed to generate a 3D diffusion proﬁle known as an orientation diffusion function (ODF) at each voxel. The ODF is used to infer the orientation of local axon ﬁber pop- ulations. Previous efforts to validate these orientation estimates have primarily relied on serial optical histology as a ground truth dataset. Histology-based pipelines involve the labor intensive task of physically sectioning the tissue into thin slices, leading to physical destruction of the sample and anisotropic resolution. These limitations potentially confound the accuracy of 3D orientation estimation, complicate the process of spatially registering the ground-truth and DTI datasets, and limit quantitative comparisons to select regions of interest (ROI) across the brain sample.  In recent years, synchrotron x-ray microcomputed tomography (microCT) has emerged as a powerful tool for high-resolution tissue imaging. With a mosaic projection-stitching method, a whole mouse brain can be imaged at an isotropic, 3D resolution of 1.2 microns after prior imaging with DTI. To enhance microCT contrast, the tis- sue specimens are ﬁxed and stained with the same kind of metal-based stains used in electron microscopy (EM) prior to embedding in resin. We will optimize this microCT-EM validation pipeline to address the limitations of pre- vious histology-based studies, and characterize DTI algorithm performance across a whole mouse brain using micron- to nano-scale neurological information.  The speciﬁc aims of the proposal are: (1) model phase contrast to optimize microCT data acquisition, (2) vali- date DTI ODF reconstruction methods using ground-truth microCT (3) characterize DTI performance using under- lying tissue microstructure information from EM. Upon completion, aim 1 will generate a novel theoretical model and acquisition strategy to exploit microCT phase contrast in strongly absorbing biological samples. Aim 2 will generate a ground-truth dataset of ODFs across a whole mouse brain, which will be used to calculate algorithm- speciﬁc spatial maps of DTI performance. In Aim 3, around 20 ROI will be selected for nano-scale imaging with EM, and DTI performance will be characterized by quantitative features of the underlying neural architecture. These results will provide an unprecedented microstructure-driven understanding of the DTI signal, allowing fu- ture studies to develop more advanced DTI models and acquisition strategies to better leverage ﬁber orientation and connectivity information in the treatment of neurological disease. Project Narrative The goal of the proposed research is to use synchrotron x-ray microcomputed tomography and serial electron microscopy to validate diffusion MRI reconstruction methods. This unprecedented pipeline allows for imaging the same tissue across scales ranging from hundreds of microns to tens of nanometers. The high resolution modalities will provide insight into the true neurological microstructure driving the diffusion MRI signal, leading to better modeling and increased clinical and research utility.","A novel multi-modal, multi-scale imaging pipeline for the validation of diffusion MRI of the brain",9836456,F31NS113571,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Mus', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neurologic', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plant Resins', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Synchrotrons', 'Techniques', 'Theoretical model', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'absorption', 'base', 'contrast enhanced', 'data acquisition', 'electron tomography', 'follow-up', 'image reconstruction', 'insight', 'interest', 'multimodality', 'nanometer', 'nanoscale', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'tractography', 'validation studies']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F31,2019,39994,246330700,0.01052352386379106
"Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  This revised NIH Individual Fellowship Award (F30) proposal seeks to develop career-specific skills and knowledge of the behavioral contributions and underlying neural mechanisms associated with co-occurring drug use disorder (DUD) and other psychiatric illnesses. The diagnosis of DUD comorbidity is well established clinically, and is prone to more difficult and expensive treatment plans and worse treatment outcomes than either diagnosis alone. Despite the prevalence and clinical significance of DUD comorbidity, few studies have characterized the interactions between environment, behavior, and neural organizations that contribute to DUD comorbidity illness trajectories. Cognitions related to self-beliefs and self-directed behaviors are compromised in individuals with DUD, depression, or PTSD, yet the altered neural circuitry underlying such deficits in comorbid individuals has not been studied. The overall research goal of the proposed project is therefore to identify traits associated with functional neural networks underlying DUD comorbidity and determine how changes in network organization lead to deficits in self-related cognitions in comorbid individuals. Additionally, machine-learning computational models will be trained on Big Data to classify brain-wide patterns of network organization at two distinct stages of DUD comorbidity development. The proposal includes a rigorous training plan for the candidate to gain expertise in neuroimaging methodology and advanced computational approaches to neuroimaging data (e.g., structural equation modeling, machine learning, and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)). An increasingly large data sample (n=550+) of adults and adolescents 12-60 years old will be used to test the aims of this proposal. In Aim 1, controlling for age and sex, environmental variables and self-beliefs will be related to the expression of DUD comorbidity. Using whole-brain mediation analyses, significant traits will then be related to areas of brain activation, with focus on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Aim 2 will use structural equation modeling to test how sex-specific changes in ACC networks are related to self-regulation in individuals with DUD and DUD comorbidity compared to healthy individuals. Aim 3 will use MVPA-derived computational models to classify whole-brain patterns of activity that characterize susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence and sustained comorbidity in adulthood. By classifying brain activity underlying DUD comorbidity at two separate stages of disorder development, this project will help pave the way for future research into more effective treatment methods and better preventative efforts to preclude DUD comorbidity. The career development milestones related to computational psychiatry – clinical medicine, responsible conduct of research, and computational neuroscience – will be attained via this mentored research proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development project seeks to use a Big Data approach to characterize the expression of drug use disorder (DUD) comorbidity. The multilayer project will develop skills and knowledge to support a better understanding of the behaviors and underlying neural mechanisms associated with self-related cognitions in DUD comorbidity. An innovative machine-learning pattern classifier will then be used to identify whole-brain resting-state activation patterns associated with susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence, and sustained comorbidity in adulthood.",Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity,9685036,F30DA043928,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equation', 'Exclusion', 'Fellowship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Perception', 'Self-Direction', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavioral deficiency', 'career', 'career development', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinically significant', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'early life stress', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multilevel analysis', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neural patterning', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'responsible research conduct', 'sex', 'skills', 'sociodemographics', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'working group']",NIDA,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,F30,2019,50016,54868437,0.013467278124308963
"Input-specific imaging and manipulation of synaptic plasticity underlying social memory Project Summary / Abstract Ascertaining the neural basis of behavior has been a cornerstone goal since the conception of neurobiology. While activity recording and loss-of-function studies have shed light on brain regions involved and necessary for the expression of certain behaviors, they are unable to determine the information each circuit is responsible for encoding. Therefore, when different nodes in the circuit are removed, the behavioral phenotype is often identical. Synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to change functional strength depending on experience, is considered the cellular correlate of learning and memory. Linking changes in the functional strength of synapses following behavior has begun to indicate what information circuits are responsible for encoding. To provide direct evidence, a tool that is able to modulate synaptic plasticity in specific circuit nodes during behavior is needed. The goal of this proposal is to create a photo-activatable inhibitor of presynaptic plasticity that will be input- and region- specific for use in behaving animals. The first aim of the proposal will create and screen constructs of photo-activatable PKI (paPKI) in their efficacy for the inhibition of protein kinase A, a kinase necessary for the induction of presynaptic plasticity. Light-dependency will be ensured and the construct will be evaluated based on its sensitivity and selectivity using advanced imaging techniques (2-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging) and biochemical assays. The second aim of the proposal will use paPKI to determine the role of specific circuit nodes in social memory. Input-specific modulation of plasticity will be paired with in depth behavioral analyses using computer vision to parse out subtle differences in social interaction. These aims directly address the BRAIN Initiative 2025 high priority goal #4: the modulation of neural activity with readouts of behavior using advanced computer vision techniques. The proposed fellowship project provides excellent training potential as it expands from the applicant’s current training in systems/circuit neuroscience to molecular and biophysical neuroscience. The project is an intersection between the mentor’s, Dr. Ryohei Yasuda, expertise in molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and the development and advanced imaging of biomodulators and sensors, and the applicant’s expertise in circuitry underlying social memory, electrophysiology and behavioral analyses using computer vision. The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience is an intensely collaborative environment filled with leaders in the field and exceptional resources, resulting in an institute that is highly productive and influential. This fellowship proposal presents excellent training potential and aims to produce tools that will advance the field. Project Narrative While the ability to discern an appropriate behavioral response during social encounters is of quintessential importance in communally living animals, the neural circuitry storing social memories that guide this behavioral choice are poorly understood. Here, we will harness and develop novel molecular tools to manipulate synaptic plasticity in an input-specific manner to discern the specific role of each node in a social memory circuit. Additionally, the tools developed in this proposal will be applicable to studies discerning the neural circuitry underlying other forms of learning and memory facilitating greater understanding of neural computations underlying behavior and how these may be altered in neuropsychiatric diseases.",Input-specific imaging and manipulation of synaptic plasticity underlying social memory,9832833,F32MH120872,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Animals', 'Assessment tool', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'Biophysics', 'Brain region', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Conceptions', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Fellowship', 'Florida', 'Goals', 'Hela Cells', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Protein Inhibition', 'Protein Kinase A Inhibitor', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Characteristics', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'commune', 'experience', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'link protein', 'loss of function', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'novel', 'optical fiber', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'protein kinase inhibitor', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'sensor', 'social', 'social learning', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NIMH,MAX PLANCK FLORIDA CORPORATION,F32,2019,65854,5627670,0.004760531615251218
"Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD Abstract Up to 80% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) will suffer from cognitive symptoms, including impaired attention, planning, reasoning and working memory as well as hallucinations, visuospatial dysfunction, and delusions. These impairments lead to mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PDD) in PD. Cognitive symptoms of PD are associated with enormous cost to our society. There are no clear biomarkers and few effective treatments for PD-MCI/PDD. Because risk for PD increases dramatically with age, this problem will surge as our population grows older. The mechanisms contributing to PD-MCI/PDD are unknown. Our group has found that low-frequency (1-8 Hz; or delta/theta bands) brain rhythms might be helpful in diagnosing cognitive dysfunction in PD. This delta/theta activity originates from areas of medial frontal cortex such as the anterior cingulate, and is detectable by mid-frontal scalp EEG electrodes. We have found that mid-frontal delta/theta brain rhythms are engaged when healthy individuals detect novelty, errors, and conflict, or make decisions. These rhythms are attenuated in PD patients. Our working model is that PD patients manifest diverse neuronal and network deficits that impair mid-frontal delta/theta activity, leading to failures in engaging cognitive control. These abnormalities contribute to PD-MCI and PDD. In this proposal we combine `big-data' machine learning tools, intraoperative neurophysiology in humans, and new brain-stimulation paradigms to investigate the role of mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms in PD. We will test the overall hypothesis that mid-frontal delta/theta impairments are a mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in PD. In Aim 1 we will determine if mid-frontal delta/theta activity predicts PD-MCI/PDD. In Aim 2 we will use unique intraoperative recordings to determine how delta/theta activity within medial frontal cortex influences neurons in the subthalamic nucleus, a key site of functional convergence that is targeted by current deep-brain stimulation for PD. Notably, the subthalamic nucleus is a compact structure that receives highly overlapping input from cognitive and motor cortical regions, making it likely that our recordings will capture cognitive processing within this nucleus. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine if subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation at delta/theta frequencies improves cognitive control in PD patients. Because these experiments involve recordings across several PD patient populations (Aim 1), from single subthalamic neurons (Aim 2), and brain stimulation (Aim 3), each of these aims will provide independent mechanistic insight into cognitive dysfunction in PD. PD is a complex disease, but if cortical EEG abnormalities are a consistent theme it might inspire new diagnostic tools or new brain-stimulation therapies for cognitive dysfunction in PD.

"MRI and machine learning to improve early prognosis and clinical management after spinal cord injury PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Purpose/Hypothesis: Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes substantial social, economic, and health burden.1 For individuals with motor incomplete SCI, some basic ability to stand or walk is expected during the recovery process,2 and this is a top priority in rehabilitative programs.3 However, establishing a prognosis for recovering community walking ability is extremely difficult.4 Within 72 hours after SCI,5 edema develops within the damaged spinal cord. This edema is a hallmark of spinal cord injury, expressed as signal hyperintensity using T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).6 Correlations between the sagittal length of this spinal cord edema and walking ability are generally poor.7,8 However, advanced but available high resolution axial T2-weighted MRI to quantify spinal cord edema in people in the acute stage of SCI may improve prediction of walking ability.9,10 The early clinical management and targeted rehabilitation of these individuals could be drastically enhanced, optimizing recovery and rehabilitation outcomes. The main objective of this research project is to use early axial spinal cord MRI sequences as neuroprognostic biomarkers to improve the prediction of residual motor function. This objective will be realized by the implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: To establish to what extent the axial damage ratio biomarker, measured by high-resolution axial T2-weighted structural imaging, can predict residual function in persons with SCI. Previously-collected axial T2-weighted spinal cord structural MRI data of 200 people with SCI from the US Model SCI System at Craig Hospital will be used to quantify cord damage. This metric will be related to the primary 1-year status-post injury outcome measures, which are clinical records of walking ability and function. Multivariate statistical analyses will be applied to create exploratory models to determine the prognostic value of the MRI measures. We hypothesize that the axial damage ratio can be used in the acute stage as an accurate and objective neuroprognostic biomarker of residual motor function. Aim 2: To identify the relationship between damage to specific spinal cord regions and specific motor and sensory deficits. MRI data from Aim 1 will be used. Spinal cord regional damage analysis will be related to right and left upper and lower extremity motor and sensory scores. Correlational statistical analyses will be applied to analyze relationships between specific tract damage and motor/sensory deficits. We hypothesize that damage to descending lateral corticospinal motor regions is related to ipsilesional motor deficits, and that similar findings exist for ascending sensory regions and sensory deficits. For both Aims, we will compare our manual damage quantification to our machine learning approach to automatically detect spinal cord damage. Aim 3: Develop, test, and distribute a machine-learning based analysis pipeline for spinal cord damage measures. We will use functions included in the Spinal Cord Toolbox and the open-source NiftyNet deep-learning platform to develop the machine-learning based analysis pipeline. The processing steps will include spinal cord detection, spinal cord damage segmentation, registration to the spinal cord template, and the calculation and output of the axial damage ratio and regional damage biomarkers. Significance: Successful completion of these Aims will advance the NIH/NICHD NCMRR aim: “to enhance the health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of people with physical disabilities.” The significance of this outcome relates directly to improving the clinical management of SCI. This research may inform clinicians, patients, and families, regarding the percentage chance of regaining walking ability. The healthcare team will be able to determine, early-on, which people will optimally respond to locomotor training. This work will significantly improve the prognosis for recovery of walking and specific motor/sensory function based on early imaging of the damaged spinal cord. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this research project is to use early axial MRI measures of spinal cord damage as objective biomarkers to improve the prediction of walking recovery and specific motor return of individuals following SCI. This research will provide patients with a quantified sense of expectations regarding their chances of walking recovery, and will help guide the healthcare team on the best options for clinical management and rehabilitation (i.e. focusing on neuroplasticity and restoration of walking versus compensatory strategies). Ultimately, this research aims to improve the lives and wellbeing of those suffering from spinal cord injury. Successful completion of this research will advance the NIH/NICHD NCMRR aim: “to enhance the health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of people with physical disabilities.” ! 1!",MRI and machine learning to improve early prognosis and clinical management after spinal cord injury,9674165,R03HD094577,"['Acute', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communities', 'Correlation Studies', 'Corticospinal Tracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Edema', 'Event', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Lateral', 'Left', 'Length', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Location', 'Locomotor training', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Team', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical Function', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Quality of life', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rogaine', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord damage', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Testing', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Extremity', 'Walking', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dorsal column', 'early detection biomarkers', 'expectation', 'functional independence', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'motor deficit', 'motor function recovery', 'motor recovery', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'prospective', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'restoration', 'secondary outcome', 'social', 'spinal cord imaging']",NICHD,REGIS UNIVERSITY,R03,2019,96034,52775,0.011527986744376773
"Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits Project Summary  Of the diverse features of the mammalian motor repertoire, skilled limb movements have become some of the more impressive and indispensable ways of interacting with the environment. The susceptibility of these movements to neurodegenerative disease and injury underscores the need for a better understanding of how neural circuits orchestrate these dexterous behaviors. This goal demands sophisticated experimental scrutiny at both neural and behavioral levels, and while the emergence of genetic tools for monitoring and manipulating neural circuits in mice has been transformative, the development of motor behavioral assays has not kept pace. Typically, a single behavioral test is applied to the question at hand, precluding a more comprehensive description of why relevant neural circuits have evolved their particular anatomical and functional attributes. Moreover, in the study of limb motor control, primate-inspired behavioral paradigms tend to be applied to the mouse by default, risking neglect of a more complete and naturalistic account of motor circuit function.  Ethology emphasizes an unbiased study of behavior under natural conditions. This proposal describes an ethological approach for the quantification and categorization of skilled limb movements in mice, enabling a depth and breadth of behavioral analysis that more closely aligns with the complexity of the underlying neural circuits. Several complementary approaches for unbiased behavioral quantification of mouse limb movements in enriched environments will be developed in parallel: a set of optical techniques enabling automated three- dimensional reconstruction of limb and digit posture and trajectory; and an approach that leverages advances in the miniaturization of motion sensors for camera-free limb tracking that can be integrated seamlessly with neural and electromyography (EMG) recordings. Through iterative refinement, this multifaceted strategy should highlight the strengths and mitigate potential drawbacks of each tracking method, providing a suite of complementary quantitative tools. Kinematic, kinetic, EMG and neural data collected across diverse behavioral contexts will be used to guide machine learning-based classification of natural structure in limb movements and in their underlying neural circuits. As a proving ground for how these naturalistic behavioral analyses can be integrated with the genetic dissection of neural circuit function, a set of molecularly defined motor circuits will be probed using novel optogenetic tools that permit selective inhibition at defined axon collateral terminals. This combination of projection specific genetic perturbation and ethologically driven behavioral analyses will provide a powerful lens through which to view the fine-grained functional organization of mammalian motor circuits. More generally, this merging of molecular and systems neuroscience approaches will offer a novel way to explore and compare fine motor control across species, equipping the field with a more comprehensive and standardized approach to study skilled behavior, and helping lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of behavioral deficits associated with neural circuit dysfunction. Project Narrative Skilled limb movements play a central role in mammalian behavior, from the seemingly mundane to the astoundingly athletic – yet little is known about how specific neural circuits orchestrate limb motor output to ensure precision and dexterity. To identify the neural basis of skilled behaviors, a more comprehensive and quantitative understanding of natural limb movements in mice is needed to take better advantage of the powerful genetic accessibility of this model system. The ability to track and define these skilled, natural movements will enable a more sensitive and empirical exploration of the neural control of behavior, and should lay the groundwork for more effective diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits caused by disease or injury.",Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits,9835325,DP2NS105555,"['Anatomy', 'Athletic', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Electromyography', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethology', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Injury', 'Kinetics', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Predisposition', 'Primates', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral study', 'dexterity', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'kinematics', 'lens', 'limb movement', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,DP2,2019,99879,65771974,0.007219107500773574
"Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08) is to provide the candidate with extensive training in 1) machine learning, 2) neuroimaging and 3) developmental psychopathology to conduct independent investigations on the neurobiology that underlies psychopathology that results from childhood maltreatment. There is strong evidence that maltreatment during childhood results in differences across multiple circuits in the developing brain. The extent that affected circuits are involved in psychopathology, however, is unclear. Determining which circuits are involved is necessary to develop interventions that target specific neurobiological systems. The primary aims of the proposed studies are to clarify the involvement of multiple brain features (e.g., structures and functional activations) in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These aims will be accomplished with machine learning. Machine learning is a set of computer-based learning methods in which meaningful theoretical models are derived from empirical data. This proposal builds on the candidate's prior training in clinical psychology, neurobiological models of traumatic stress, and advanced computational methods to develop expertise in: 1) computational methods that include machine learning, genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks, 2) the collection of multi-modal neuroimaging data and 3) the effect of maltreatment on development. Additional professional development training will include grantsmanship, manuscript preparation, and research ethics. To achieve these aims, the candidate has assembled an accomplished mentorship team of experts that span a range of disciplines including developmental psychopathology, computational science, and neuroscience. The training and mentorship will allow the candidate to conduct a series of research studies with two primary aims. The first is to use machine learning to develop a model that integrates structural and task-based functional MRI data to differentiate adolescents with a history of maltreatment from controls. Identifying the features that best differentiate these groups will determine which circuits are implicated in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These models will be constructed with data from an existing high-dimensional database that was obtained by project mentors. The second aim is to obtain pilot data on the association between variations in brain regions and the severity of psychopathology in a sample of maltreated adolescents. When this research is completed, the brain features most affected by maltreatment will be identified and the relation between these brain features and observable symptoms will be quantified. Such knowledge will provide a set of targets for treatment and assist in our classification of maltreatment-related mental illness. The experience and data obtained from this project will position the candidate to pursue future NIH funding to further examine the neurobiology of maltreatment- related psychopathology in adolescence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Child abuse prior to adolescence is associated with marked impairment across the lifespan and is a significant public health concern. There is considerable need to understand how abuse in childhood affects the developing brain and how these changes correspond to observable maladaptive behaviors during adolescence. This project aims to quantify the contribution of brain circuits to maltreatment-related psychopathology in order to improve diagnosis and identify targets for intervention.",Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning,9687747,K08MH107661,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08)', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'computer science', 'conditioned fear', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'maltreatment', 'multidimensional data', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'putamen', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K08,2019,163943,66370127,0.011118837602669095
"Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD Overall Summary The overarching goal of the proposed center is to leverage molecular and circuit biomarkers to advance the understanding of mechanisms and personalized treatment of topiramate treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder comorbid with PTSD. We propose an integrative translational focus on alterations in excitatory and inhibitory signaling, focusing on GABA and glutamate and related circuitry, to model the neurobiology of PTSD comorbid with PTSD and the mitigating effects of topiramate. We will characterize excitatory and inhibitory molecular markers in an animal model of AUD comorbid with PTSD, utilizing genomic markers in the brain and plasma markers in rodents. In clinical trial participants we will characterize excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signaling by ascertaining plasma markers, GRIK 1 genotype and neural circuit markers utilizing TMS evoked potentials in EEG, task-based functional MRI and MR spectroscopy. This goal will be achieved through the activities of three research projects supported by two research cores, the administrative core and the Scientific Advisory Board (Figure1). In Project 1 lead by Silvia Fossati Ph.D. and Jorge Manzanares Robles Ph.D. we will study the behavioral and molecular effects of two doses of topiramate vs. vehicle in animal models of AUD alone, PTSD alone and AUD+PTSD. In Project 2 lead by Michael Bogenschutz M.D. and Joshua Lee M.D. we will study the behavioral, genetic and plasma biomarker effects of topiramate vs. placebo in 150 participants with co-occurring AUD and PTSD. In project 3 lead by Amit Etkin M.D., Ph.D. and Charles R. Marmar M.D. we will ascertain multi-modal imaging markers including task based fMRI, TMS evoked potentials in EEG and MRS. Imaging markers will be used to characterize excitatory and inhibitory circuits in Project 2 clinical trial participants with AUD+PTSD to determine predictors and mechanisms of topiramate vs. placebo treatment outcomes. Plasma biomarkers in Project 2 will be related to the same or homologous plasma biomarkers in Project 1. Circuit markers from Project 3 will be related to genomic markers in the same or homologous brain regions in Project 1. The Biofluids Biomarker Core (BBC) lead by Dr. Fossati will support collection of plasma biomarkers (GABA, glutamate, HPA axis, neuropeptides, neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress) in animals in Project 1 and clinical trial participants in Project 2. The Analytics and Biostatistics Core (ABC) lead by Eugene Laska Ph.D. and Carole Segal Ph.D. will support experimental design, formulation of hypothesis, power calculations, and data integrity, management and analysis for Project 1, 2 and 3, implementing advanced statistical models for individualized prediction of response to topiramate in Project 1 and Project 2. Overall Narrative We aim to advance personalized topiramate treatment for comorbid AUD and PTSD by focusing on network excitatory and inhibitory imbalances underlying heightened negative emotions and impairments in executive function and emotion regulation. Excitatory and inhibitory targets will be assessed with brain, plasma and circuit markers, where possible harmonizing the approach for optimizing discovery of mechanisms and prediction of topiramate treatment in animal models and in clinical trial participants. We will achieve this aim with a center driven approach to discovery with three integrative design elements and four cross-project center aims, creating translational bridges among animal model, clinical trial and imaging studies.",Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD,9938893,P01AA027057,"['Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Data Analytics', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Equilibrium', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Formulation', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Placebos', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol comorbidity', 'alcohol cue', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'design', 'drinking', 'dual diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'genomic biomarker', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'response', 'source localization', 'topiramate', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIAAA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,P01,2019,169483,329565273,-0.002541912712668321
"Image-guided robot for high-throughput microinjection of Drosophila embryos PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is submitted in response to the NIH Development of Animal Models and Related Biological Materials for Research (R21) program. The proposal develops an image-guided robotic platform that performs the automated delivery of molecular genetic tools and non-genetically encoded reagents such as chemical libraries, fluorescent dyes to monitor cellular processes, functionalized magnetic beads, or nanoparticles into thousands of Drosophila embryos in a single experimental session. The proposed work builds on recent engineering innovations in our collaborative group which has developed image-guided robotic systems that can precisely interface with single cells in intact tissue. The two Specific Aims provide for a systematic development of the proposed technologies. AIM 1 first engineers a robotic platform (‘Autoinjector’) that can scan and image Drosophila embryos in arrays of egg laying plates. We will utilize machine learning algorithms for automated detection of embryos, followed by thresholding and morphology analysis to detect embryo centroids and annotate injection sites. In AIM 2, we will utilize microprocessor-controlled fluidic circuits for programmatic delivery of femtoliter to nanoliter volumes of reagents into individual embryos. We will quantify the efficacy of the Autoinjector by comparing the survival, fertility, and transformation rates of transposon or PhiC31-mediated transgenesis to manual microinjection datasets. Finally, we will demonstrate the efficient delivery of sgRNAs and mutagenesis in the presence of Cas9. This project fits very well within the goals of the program by engineering a novel tool for producing and improving animal models. The Autoinjector will accelerate Drosophila research and empower scientists to perform novel experiments and genome-scale functional genomics screens that are currently too inefficient or labor intensive to be conducted on a large scale and may additionally enable other novel future applications.

"Neural-derived extracellular vesicles microRNAs in bipolar disorder: a peripheral window into the brain Project Summary/Abstract Bipolar disorder is a chronic and often severe psychiatric disorder with a strong genetic basis. However, even with significant progress made by molecular genetic studies, the few genetic variants associated with the disorder explain only a small portion of its heritability, which led to the hypothesis of the involvement of epigenetic alterations in BD’s pathophysiology. While recent studies have attempted to identify epigenetic biomarkers in BD, most results are limited due to the tissue specificity of epigenetic alterations and the biased assessments of candidate genes or genome-wide investigations through microarrays. Since the search for biomarkers have repetitively focused on peripheral measures that do not necessarily reflect brain alterations, significant biologically- and clinically-relevant findings have been significantly hindered. This study will fill this important gap by measuring epigenetic markers in plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by the brain. Specifically, we will focus on microRNAs and other non-coding RNAs that have been recently proposed to mediate important mechanisms in BD and may integrate gene and environment stimuli. Of note, microRNAs- filled EVs are released by the neural tissue as a method of cell-to-cell communication and may be the key players in transferring epigenetic markers to germ cells, ultimately contributing to the inter- and transgenerational transmission of BD. Our working hypothesis is that patients with BD will show alterations in specific miRNAs and other non-coding RNA transcripts in plasma neural-derived EVs compared to controls. To test this, we will initially identify neural-specific EVs microRNAs in BD by analyzing blood samples from 60 healthy controls and 60 BD type I patients (already collected and stored in our Department) (Aim 1). After neural-derived EVs immunoprecipitation and characterization, RNA will be isolated and next generation sequencing libraries will be prepared and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq instrument with 1x75 bp single-end reads at an approximate depth of 10-15 million reads per sample. Significantly altered miRNAs will be validated by real-time PCR and the putative biological relevance of the differentially expressed transcripts will be assessed by functional pathway analyses. In addition, a machine learning model will be built using the miRNA expression data in order to predict whether an individual sample belongs to the BD or control group, allowing for the establishment of a clinically useful predictive biosignature that can have immediate impact in the field. On a second step we will investigate the correlation between neuronal EVs transcriptome markers with clinical, neuroanatomical, and neurocognitive parameters available for each subject, with the ultimate goal of identifying the clinical relevance of the newly- identified EVs markers in endophenotypes of illness (Aim 2). The identification of such brain-specific markers will likely open new avenues for scientific investigation of BD. Public Health Relevance Statement The proposed research is relevant to public health because bipolar disorder is a chronic and highly disabling condition with a strong familial aggregation, yet non-genetic mechanisms (such as microRNAs) underlying the disorder are still fairly unknown. The investigation of plasma neural-derived extracellular vesicles in bipolar disorder patients and controls and the development of a machine learning algorithm for the identification of a microRNA biosignature can lead to the identification of clinically relevant peripherally measured brain-specific biomarkers that can improve our understanding of the disorder and inform the development of personalized treatments.",Neural-derived extracellular vesicles microRNAs in bipolar disorder: a peripheral window into the brain,9822873,R21MH117636,"['Affect', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edetic Acid', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'First Degree Relative', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Germ Cells', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Multivesicular Body', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'biosignature', 'candidate marker', 'clinically relevant', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'endophenotype', 'epigenetic marker', 'extracellular vesicles', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'intercellular communication', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'milliliter', 'next generation sequencing', 'non-genetic', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'severe psychiatric disorder', 'specific biomarkers', 'transcriptome', 'transmission process', 'vesicular release', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2019,192500,135644722,-0.001273280156866814
"MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy parkinsonian type (MSA-P), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are costly and devastating neurodegenerative diseases. They have overlapping clinical manifestations and diagnosis remains challenging in many cases. Thus far no effective treatments have been developed to meaningfully slow or stop their progression. This is due in part to a lack of tools to objectively measure degeneration in the neural systems affected by each of these diseases. Availability of such tools would assist clinical diagnosis, facilitate selection of appropriate patient groups for trial recruitment, and enable objective measurement of treatment outcomes. Recent MRI studies suggest that disease-specific brain changes can, indeed, be identified in these parkinsonian diseases. The objective of this research is to identify univariable markers and multivariable MRI signatures that capture distinct patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to accurately distinguish these diseases.  To accomplish this the investigators use 3 Tesla MRI contrasts sensitive to key features of neurodegeneration to 1) identify structures damaged by PD, MSA-P and PSP and 2) to quantify the extent of damage in each neural system in parkinsonian diseases. Specifically, the investigators use neuromelanin- sensitive MRI to measure neuromelanin loss and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and R2* imaging to measure iron accumulation in patients with PD, MSA-P, and PSP. Using these contrasts and an innovative region of interest (ROI) selection approach, they reproducibly measure patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems. In Aim 1 the investigators use neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to study neuromelanin loss in PD, MSA-P and PSP in to identify univariable disease features that are differentially affected by parkinsonian diseases and may assist distinguishing these conditions. In Aim 2 they use QSM and R2* MRI to study ROIs differentially impacted by PD, MSA-P and PSP to identify iron accumulation biomarkers to help distinguish these diseases. In Aim 3 the investigators apply machine learning classification algorithms to identify multivariable MRI signatures of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to differentiate PD, MSA-P and PSP. Study outputs will be candidate MRI biomarkers and disease signatures. The long term goal of this research is to further develop these outputs for use as clinical diagnostic tools and as biomarkers for subject selection and outcome measurement in clinical trials.  Through this career award Dr. Huddleston will gain new skills in MRI methods, data science, and neural systems imaging in parkinsonian diseases. These new skills will enable Dr. Huddleston to design and lead interdisciplinary neuroimaging biomarker studies for Parkinson’s disease and related disorders. His mentor team is comprised of leaders in their fields. This team and the dynamic research environment at Emory University provide the necessary support for Dr. Huddleston to successfully transition to scientific independence. There is an urgent public health need for new treatments to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy, and objective tools to distinguish these diseases for clinical and research purposes are lacking. The outputs of the proposed research will be candidate MRI biomarkers and multivariable MRI signatures to differentiate these conditions. These candidate biomarkers may be developed for use in clinical trial designs to increase their odds of success, and they may also assist clinical diagnosis.",MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism,9786824,K23NS105944,"['Affect', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical assessments', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Iron', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple System Atrophy', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Progressive Supranuclear Palsy', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Red nucleus structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Subjects Selections', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromelanin', 'neuron loss', 'nigrostriatal system', 'novel', 'pars compacta', 'patient screening', 'putamen', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2019,192564,507546965,0.02828329405385704
"Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery Recent years have seen rapid growth in the availability of large, complex functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets of the human brain. However, the potential of this fMRI Big Data is presently limited by our understanding of the neural sources that contribute to fMRI signals. Fluctuations in arousal (i.e., in the level wakefulness and alertness) are known to modulate cognitive and behavioral processes and to display prominent alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders. Yet, since the vast majority of fMRI datasets lack neurophysiological or behavioral indices of arousal, fMRI Big Data cannot be readily harnessed to understand human brain arousal in health and disease. Recent data-driven approaches attempt to fill this gap but have limitations. The overall goal of this proposal is to increase the transformative potential of fMRI Big Data for human neuroscience through a novel analytic framework for detecting arousal fluctuations from fMRI data alone. We will accomplish this goal by developing and disseminating tools for modeling arousal fluctuations based on powerful statistical learning methods (Specific Aim 1). We will apply these models to large fMRI databases of healthy aging and Alzheimer’s Disease, both of which are associated with altered arousal (Specific Aims 2 and 3). We will capitalize on these databases to determine how knowledge of brain arousal fluctuations improves neuroimaging biomarkers of aging- and neurodegenerative disease-related changes in human brain function, and the extent to which arousal itself constitutes an informative biomarker of these states. This research would, moreover, increase the reliability and translational potential of fMRI studies more broadly by providing the ability to account for these major neural (arousal) state changes. These immediate research goals form a strong bridge with my long-term research objective of understanding principles of brain function by developing and innovatively adapting methods for the analysis of large and complex neuroimaging datasets. This objective is enabled by the mentored training plan, where I will (i) develop expertise in cutting-edge machine learning techniques and (ii) apply these techniques to multimodal neuroimaging data. The two co-mentors have complementary expertise that align, respectively, with these two training components. Aims 1 and 2 will span the mentored phase and part of the independent phase, while Aim 3 (application to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data) will be performed in the independent phase. The mentored environment of the NIH Intramural Research Program provides the resources for all planned data acquisition, as well as a rich community of neuroscience investigators and seminars. Interaction with the extramural (Columbia University) co-mentor will occur through frequent video conferences and several visits, with opportunities to engage with the Columbia data science community. Developing models of brain arousal fluctuations in fMRI data would contribute to our understanding of arousal mechanisms and its alteration with a variety of brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease. Further, the ability to account for arousal fluctuations in fMRI data analysis would broadly improve the sensitivity of fMRI for neuroscience and clinical research, and may be critical for developing reliable, noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.",Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery,9783829,K22ES028048,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Extramural Activities', 'Eye', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'alertness', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'clinical database', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'dimensional analysis', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'healthy aging', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'rapid growth', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'tool', 'usability']",NIEHS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K22,2019,202477,117374875,0.021134086577435394
"A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles In the United States, 2.8 million people every year seek medical attention for traumatic brain injury (TBI), of which 80% are considered to have a mild TBI (i.e. concussion). Even in those with mild injuries, 10-20% of individuals will suffer long-term disability including seizures and emotional and behavioral issues. One of the primary challenges in TBI care is appropriately classifying this heterogeneous injury and identifying patients at risk for these chronic impairments. Conventional imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), are commonly used to classify TBI, but do not reliably capture the full extent of the injury, particularly in those patients with mild injuries. Currently, there are few molecular markers to assist in the assessment of an individual's unique injury and subsequent recovery and biomarkers are desperately needed in the field that correlate with these varied endophenotypes, track the progress of the disease, and predict clinical outcomes. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a microchip-based platform that can be used to characterize TBI and its recovery using the RNA cargo found in brain-derived circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. Unlike prior work that has mainly focused on single biomarkers, our approach measures a panel of circulating EV miRNA markers processed with machine learning algorithms, to more comprehensively capture the state of the injured and recovering brain. Our proposal combines surface marker-specific nanomagnetic isolation of brain-derived EVs from a variety of cell types, biomarker discovery using RNA sequencing, and machine learning processing of EV miRNA cargo to measure the state of injury and recovery in TBI. Nanoscale exosomes are known to shed from brain cells into the blood stream, carrying with them the molecular signatures that can be used to better diagnose and treat injuries, such as traumatic brain injury. We propose an innovative, clinically practical approach to probe the RNA contained within these nanoscale vesicles to better understand a patient's injury and recovery to better guide treatment. Our rapid and easily multiplexed platform has great potential for non-invasive diagnostics and monitoring of both secondary injury progression and drug efficacy, offers tremendous benefits for patients.",A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles,9788528,R21MH118170,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Archives', 'Astrocytes', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood Volume', 'Brain', 'Brain Concussion', 'Brain Edema', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Production', 'RNA', 'RNA Probes', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'drug efficacy', 'endophenotype', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'individual response', 'injured', 'injury and repair', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'machine learning algorithm', 'manufacturability', 'medical attention', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'microchip', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'nanomagnetic', 'nanoscale', 'neuropathology', 'next generation', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'nucleic acid detection', 'outcome forecast', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ratiometric', 'research clinical testing', 'response to injury', 'technology development', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2019,207338,593605914,0.01469996728734747
"Environment, Metabolomics, and PD Project Abstract Our PEG study is among the largest Parkinson's disease (PD) population-based study with exceptional high-quality disease characterization and in-depth exposure assessment. Patients are diagnosed and examined (multiple times) by a UCLA movement disorder specialist. We developed a longitudinal geographic information system (GIS) based assessment for pesticide exposures that links state-mandated information on type, date, and location of all agricultural pesticide applications in California recorded since 1974 to land use maps and study participants' residences and work places. Here we propose to combine a powerful new metabolomics tool and system biology analytic methods to identify signatures for toxic exposures that evoke long-term biologic responses. The metabolomics data we will generate will help us identify metabolic profiles for chronic environmental exposures for both PD patients and population controls. This will generate a first understanding of the metabolic consequences of chronic low dose pesticide exposure in PD. However, biologic processes, including biologic responses to chronic toxicant exposures and those involved in disease development, are highly dynamic and interactive systems. The PEG study is uniquely capable to begin investigating these multidimensional networks linking exposure and disease. We have already generated genome and epigenome profiles for 550 PD patients and 250 controls. Here we newly propose to generate and analyze serum based metabolome profiles (targeted and untargeted) for these same 800 study participants characterizing environmental pesticide exposures via metabolome wide association analyses. We aim to develop a metabolite signature of environmental exposure using supervised machine learning methods, and also determine if these are disease specific or found in both exposed cases and controls. Furthermore, incorporating our genome and epigenome information, we propose to use biological systems analysis to identify multi-omics network patterns that distinguish environmental exposures that contribute to PD onset and progression. We expect this to show a chronic response pattern across different molecular layers and are influenced by many environmental factors. Combining multi-omic measures based on multidimensional network and system analyses will address the gaps in our current knowledge concerning molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects of chronic low dose exposures in PD. Project Narrative Here we propose to build upon a unique resource - the PEG population-based Parkinson's disease (PD) study - to identify metabolic signatures of chronic environmental exposures and disease in 550 PD patients and 250 population controls. Importantly, we plan to integrate exposure and effect markers across multiple molecular layers (genome, epigenome, metabolome), with the goal to obtain a more holistic understanding of molecular changes due to chronic environmental exposures. Our approach incorporates multi-omics measures and multidimensional network and system analyses to address gaps in our current knowledge concerning molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects of chronic low dose exposures in PD.","Environment, Metabolomics, and PD",9652630,R21ES030175,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Anions', 'Archives', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biometry', 'Caffeine', 'California', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatography', 'Chronic', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier Transform', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Onset of illness', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pesticides', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Population Study', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Policy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specialist', 'Structure of molecular layer of cerebellar cortex', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'agricultural pesticide', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biological systems', 'brain health', 'case control', 'cell type', 'disorder control', 'disorder risk', 'environmental pesticide exposure', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'land use', 'learning strategy', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'patient population', 'pesticide exposure', 'population based', 'residence', 'response', 'screening', 'supervised learning', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2019,209000,673201228,0.009624046276925211
"Distinguishing Lipid Subtypes by Amplifying Contrast from J-Coupling Project Summary/Abstract With the global rise in obesity-related diseases and increasing recognition of the role of fat in diseases such as fatty liver, there is growing need for a noninvasive chemical assay of in vivo lipid depots. But the rich chemistry of these molecules is often ignored in MRI, which typically treats fat as a homogeneous proton species because differences in chemical shift and relaxation are difficult to distinguish in a clinical setting. Innovation: This proposal will be the first to use nonuniform echo spacing to generate J-coupling based contrast between chemically different fats. While fat spins often give monotonically decaying signal under a uniformly spaced spin echo train, J-coupling causes nonuniformly spaced spin echo trains to generate complex fingerprints, which distinguish and even quantify fats with otherwise similar MR properties. Significance: The immediate clinical impact will be to demonstrate a novel J-coupling based contrast mechanism in vivo which will contribute to a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish the 25% of the population with benign steatosis from the 2-3% with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The broader significance of this work is that this novel contrast mechanism could revolutionize the study and clinical management of many diseases associated with bioactive lipid subtypes. Approach: The aims are designed to test the hypothesis that nonuniform echo trains (1) can create contrast between different fats, which (2) will contribute to a multiparametric noninvasive protocol to distinguish benign steatosis and NASH. Aim 1 will identify the echo spacing best suited for distinguishing benign steatosis and NASH, first using density matrix simulations based on high resolution spectra of liver fat from animals with each disease, and then using experiments on whole rat livers. In Aim 2, the sequence developed in Aim 1 will be tested in humans with biopsy proven benign steatosis or NASH, along with a suite of standard methods of liver and fat characterization. This metric, and also metrics derived from conventional images, will be tested for the ability to separate these patient groups. In addition, machine learning algorithms will be used to find a metric that combines multiecho intensities with standard MR metrics. This proposal will prove the usefulness of nonuniform echo trains as a new contrast mechanism and yield a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish simple steatosis and NASH. Moreover, this general approach to distinguish fats could ultimately find a broad range of biomedical applications, such as imaging lipid based therapeutics, distinguishing the 4 fatty acids that make up 90% of the adipose stores, or detecting other lipotoxic subtypes. The results of this work will justify a larger scale study to properly validate the sensitivity to different fat species in humans. Project Narrative This proposal will prove the usefulness of nonuniform echo trains both as a new J-coupling based contrast mechanism and as part of a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish simple steatosis (~25% of the population) from patients on the NASHfibrosiscirrhosis trajectory of metabolically induced liver disease (2- 3% of the population). Moreover, this general approach to distinguish fats could ultimately find a broad range of biomedical applications, such as imaging lipid based therapeutics, distinguishing the 4 fatty acids that make up 90% of the adipose stores, or detecting other lipotoxic subtypes.

"Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers Project Summary Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) has been proposed as a technique to quantify tissue parameters, such as T1 and T2 relaxation times, which are biomarkers for various pathologies. One assumption of MRF is that the signal in each voxel is generated by exactly one set of tissue parameters. Due to MRI resolution at the range of millimeter in combination with the cellular structure of biological tissue, each voxel consists of multiple tissue compartments. An over-simplified single compartment model results in apparent relaxation times that are influenced by the relaxation times and the fractional proton densities of all contributing compartments. This can lead to a misinterpretation of signal changes. For example, in diseases that causes demyelination in white matter (Multiple Sclerosis, Dementia), a reduction of the myelin water fraction would result in a misleading change of the apparent relaxation time of the voxel. We propose a multi-compartment MRF method that allows to identify multiple tissue contributions within a voxel, including the fractional proton density (PD) of different compartments. Our machine learning based approach automatically identifies the number of compartments within each voxel that can be identified with the available SNR in that voxel. We will correct for partial-volume effects at the borders of two types of tissues, as well as analyze tissue microstructure. For the second case our learned model will also include chemical exchange between compartments. After an initial validation phase using numerical simulations, we will first perform MRF scans of dedicated 3D printed phantoms with multiple compartments. Our quality criterion is successful estimation of all simulated tissue compartments for all voxels with a relative error of less than 5% to the ground truth. We will then perform in-vivo MRF measurements of healthy volunteers (n=5). We will generate synthetic FLAIR and MP-RAGE contrasts from parameter maps estimated with conventional and the proposed multi-compartment MRF technique. We will compare them with currently used clinical contrasts acquired using established pulse sequences and validate the performance of our approach by measuring the cortical thickness. Further, we will validate the performance for microstructure composition in white matter. Our hypothesis is that it will be possible separate the compartments for myelin, intra- and extra-cellular water and compare the results to ex-vivo data found in literature. In summary, the methods developed in this R21 proposal will provide a novel technique to accurately and reproducibly identify biomarkers beyond the resolution of a voxel. It will allow to identify changes in tissue composition and fractional proton density at the microstructure level. Project Narrative The overarching goal of this proposal is to establish a MR imaging technique for quantifying biomarkers at the sub-voxel level. We will develop a machine learning based MR fingerprinting image reconstruction that enables the identification and characterization of multiple compartments within a voxel in terms of fractional proton density and relaxation times. We will generate accurate synthetic fluid suppressed images such as the FLAIR and MP- RAGE with accurate partial volume behavior and analyze the myelin water fraction and the corresponding relaxation times in white matter.",Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers,9825278,R21EB027241,"['3D Print', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Demyelinations', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Fingerprint', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Protons', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Water', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'gray matter', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'millimeter', 'neuroimaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'physical process', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'tissue biomarkers', 'white matter']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2019,209851,329565273,-0.007086067893238896
"In Vivo Mapping of Uncharted Functional Units of Tongue Motion During Speech Project Summary Tongue cancer and the treatments used to cure the disease such as glossectomy can have debilitating effects on speech and swallowing, yet not much is known about the relationship between tongue movements in speech and reconstruction choices after cancer resection. The tongue’s vital role in speaking and swallowing is executed by a uniquely complex array of muscles which deform locally into functional units. Tongue movements are governed by synergistic activation of these functional units using orthogonally oriented muscle fibers not a rigid skeletal structure. Functional units, which are regions of 3D coherent motion, are the structures that link low-level muscle activity to high-level surface tongue geometry. This link, the organization of functional units, can provide considerable insight into normal motor control and adapted tongue motion, as in patients who have had surgery for tongue cancer. However, there is poor understanding of the details of how muscle morphology contributes to function due to tongue muscle interdigitation and complex local activation. A key to understanding the relationship between the structure and function of the tongue is to identify functional units of motion in localized tongue regions and map them to muscle anatomy. A large step in this direction can be gained by developing a tool to cluster 3D coherent motion patterns from tagged MRI, and register them to muscle anatomy from high-resolution MRI. Speech motor control is a critical area of importance where platform tools for machine learning techniques are lacking. The goal of this project is to create a framework to relate the functional units to tongue muscle anatomy. This framework will enhance tongue motion analysis in medical research and clinical applications, where MRI is frequently used. To address this goal, we have already developed technologies to analyze high-resolution and tagged-MRI. The first is a detailed 3D muscle atlas based on 3D high-resolution MRI, which depicts the locations of both extrinsic and intrinsic muscles, and will be registered to each speaker to identify and track their muscles in the 3D tagged data sets. The second is software to derive 3D displacement and strain fields from tagged MR images. These displacements, strains, and derived quantities will be used to extract spatio-temporal feature vectors that define coherent regions, which will be verified with simulation. The vectors will then be input into a novel computational method using a NMF and clustering, the goal of which is to establish the functional units of speech. In addition, biomechanical simulations will be used to co-validate our findings. The concept of functional units is at the core of the proposed work, as it can provide insights into tongue muscle coordination in patients after glossectomy surgery. The research plan comprises two specific aims: (1) develop a computational method to establish functional units from MRI and (2) determine the relationship between alterations in anatomy and alterations in functional unit motion after tongue cancer treatment. Linking the functional units to the anatomy will allow the design of more focused treatments and therapies for tongue motion-related disorders. Project Narrative Functions of the tongue—speaking, eating, and breathing—are executed by using a complex muscular array to create global motions (synergies) by deforming local functional units which are intermediate structures that link muscle activity to surface tongue geometry. This project will develop new computational tools that will enable researchers and clinicians to determine the functional units of specific motions and relate them to the muscle anatomy. Such a breakthrough will dramatically improve our knowledge of the mechanisms of muscle coordination, thereby permitting improvement of diagnosis and treatment of tongue motion-related disorders.",In Vivo Mapping of Uncharted Functional Units of Tongue Motion During Speech,9636557,R21DC016047,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Bone structure', 'Breathing', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Elements', 'Excision', 'Geometry', 'Gestures', 'Glossectomy', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Fibers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Therapy', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Extracts', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Treatment-Related Cancer', 'Unit of Measure', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical application', 'computational basis', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'digital', 'functional independence', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'malignant tongue neoplasm', 'motor control', 'multidimensional data', 'muscular structure', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predict clinical outcome', 'reconstruction', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'synergism', 'theories', 'tool', 'vector']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2019,210725,551214295,-0.06728272299953593
"GAZE AND THE VISUAL CONTROL OF FOOT PLACEMENT WHEN WALKING OVER ROUGH TERRAIN PROJECT SUMMARY & ABSTRACT  Human locomotion through natural environments requires the coordination of all levels of the sensorimotor hierarchy, from the cortical areas involved in processing of visual information and high level planning to the subcortical and spinal structures involved in the regulation of the gait and posture. However, despite the complex neural bases of human locomotion, the output is highly regular and well organized around the basic physical dynamics and biomechanics that define the stability and energetic costs of moving a bipedal body through space. There is a rich and growing body of literature describing detailed knowledge each of the individual components of human locomotion, including neural mechanisms, muscular neuromechanics, and biomechanics. However, very little research exists on the way that visual input is used to dynamically control locomotion, and the overall control structure of the integrated neural and mechanical system during natural locomotion through a complex and dynamic world. This lack of integrative research not only restricts the breadth of impact of research from these individual disciplines, but also limits our ability to develop adequate treatment plans for loss of locomotor ability deriving from systems-level factors such as aging, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease. In order to to fill this critical gap in our knowledge about human locomotion, it is necessary to develop an integrated research program that examines the interactions between the visual, neural, and mechanical bases of human movement through the world. In service of this general goal, this proposal outlines research projects aimed at specific unanswered questions about locomotion over different terrains. This proposal comprises three specific research and training aims on the visual control of locomotion over rough terrain. Aim 1 focuses on the behavioral task itself, Aim 2 investigates the sensory stimulus experienced during real-world locomotion, and Aim 3 examines the motor integration of visually specified goals into the ongoing gait cycle. Aim 1 investigates effects of changing environmental uncertainty and task demands on gaze allocation strategies during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 2 analyzes and models the visual stimulus experienced during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 3 determines how visually specified target footholds and targets are integrated into the ongoing preferred steady-state gait. Together these aims will significantly advance our understanding of how humans use vision to control their movement through the natural world, which greatly increase our ability to develop clinical diagnosis and treatment for loss of locomotor function. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Very little research exists on the way that visual input is used to dynamically control locomotion, and the overall control structure of the integrated neural and mechanical system during natural locomotion. This lack of integrative research limits our ability to develop adequate treatment plans for loss of locomotor ability deriving from systems-level factors such as aging, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease. In order to fill this critical gap in our knowledge about human locomotion, this proposal develops an integrated research program that examines the interactions between the visual, neural, and mechanical bases of human movement through the world.",GAZE AND THE VISUAL CONTROL OF FOOT PLACEMENT WHEN WALKING OVER ROUGH TERRAIN,9999721,R00EY028229,"['3-Dimensional', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Locomotion', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Nature', 'Neuromechanics', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Posture', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Uncertainty', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'area MST', 'area MT', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cost', 'design', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'foot', 'gaze', 'insight', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuromechanism', 'neuromuscular', 'novel', 'optic flow', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'skills', 'statistics', 'treadmill', 'treatment planning', 'visual control', 'visual information', 'visual processing', 'visual stimulus', 'visual-motor integration']",NEI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R00,2019,249000,38247784,-0.013315040417635817
"Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations TOWARD A HIGH DIMENSIONAL COMPUTATIONAL DESCRIPTION OF VARIATION IN HUMAN DECISION-MAKING ACROSS PSYCHIATRIC AND NON-PSYCHIATRIC POPULATIONS PI: Dr. John P. O'Doherty Institution: California Institute of Technology PROJECT SUMMARY  Computational psychiatry (CP) promises to gain deeper explanatory insight into psychiatric disorders through the application of formal computational models to task-related behavioral data and brain measures. However, research in CP to date has mostly involved a narrow unidimensional focus, utilizing either a relatively limited set of computational constructs such as simple model-free (MF) reinforcement learning (RL), and/or restricted to studying a specific task, a specific disease, or even a particular model parameter. For CP to reach its potential, we need to broaden the field's scope. To achieve this, it is necessary to develop an integrated theory and formal framework supported by a task battery that will enable the quantification of individual differences across a range of computational mechanisms pertinent to the diagnosis and treatment of clinical disorders. The objective of the current proposal is to implement the initial groundwork needed to build and test a computational framework and task battery that can facilitate a multi-dimensional computational description of individual variability in parameters relevant for characterizing psychiatric dysfunction.  We have constructed a computational assessment battery (CAB) consisting of four distinct yet inter- related tasks that move beyond simple RL to probe various aspects of learning, cognition, and decision-making. First, we assess learning about losses as well as rewards. Secondly, we measure model-based (MB) alongside simple MF learning and decision making, and the arbitration allocating control to either strategy. Thirdly, we examine strategies for solving the exploration/exploitation dilemma, in which individuals have to decide whether to exploit an option known to yield reward or explore an option whose outcomes are unknown. Finally, we assess social-learning, in which an individual can either infer the goals of another individual or simply imitate that agent's behavior.  We propose to build an integrated computational model that can capture relevant computations being implemented in each of the tasks in our battery, alongside a hierarchical model-fitting and parameter estimation framework to enable us to retrieve reliable parameter estimates for each computational variable of interest. We will leverage common computational mechanisms engaged across our task battery to improve estimability and generalizability. We will then acquire behavioral data in a large on-line (n=1000), and modest (n=100) in-lab sample on the CAB to establish the internal validity and test/re-test reliability of our computational model and parameter estimates. Finally, we will explore the relationship between model-estimated parameter estimates from behavior on our task battery and variability in self-reported traits and states relevant for psychiatric disease in our healthy samples, as well as in a pilot sample (n=60) of patients recruited from the UCLA psychiatry outpatient clinics. These efforts will form the basis of a Computational Psychiatry Toolbox for behavioral testing, model-fitting and parameter estimation that will eventually be released as a resource to the research community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop a comprehensive approach to characterize an individual's ability to think, learn and make decisions in terms of a series of specific brain processes or `computations'. We then aim to determine whether variation in these computations can in turn be related to a variety of symptoms that can occur in psychiatric disorders. To achieve this, we will develop new mathematical and experimental tools to assess variation in behavior across individuals, and refine, test and validate these tools in a preliminary sample of healthy participants and psychiatric patients.",Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations,9827920,R21MH120805,"['Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Anxiety', 'Arbitration', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Functional disorder', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Undifferentiated', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large scale simulation', 'recruit', 'social learning', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2019,260395,81181560,0.006003536042589021
"ADNI Psychometrics: Machine Learning to discern Natural History Aim 2 Supplement Project Summary/Abstract This supplement is to a funded R01 called ADNI Psychometrics. This Supplement builds on the Second Specific Aim of the funded parent grant. That Aim focused on characterizing brain structure and functioning for people with different cognitively- defined subgroups of Alzheimer's disease. The Supplement adds one technique for analyzing the longitudinal structural data we are already analyzing. The new technique for structural data is machine learning. We have the opportunity to collaborate with a talented faculty member in Biomedical Informatics who has specific expertise in machine learning approaches to anatomical data (J Gennari). Dr. Genarri will supervise machine learning approaches to complement the various analytical approaches we already have underway for the longitudinal structural imaging data of Aim 2. Longitudinal imaging data are particularly significant, as any differences we find in the evolution of brain structure over time across subgroups supports the notion that the subgroups have distinct natural histories, which in turn goes a long way towards the provocative conclusion that these subgroups of “Alzheimer's disease” represent distinct conditions. Machine learning approaches to these data were not envisioned in the initial proposal, but represent a particularly valuable complementary approach that may identify similarities and differences in trajectories of the evolution of brain structure that would not be apparent using the more traditional analytic pipelines we outlined in the proposal. This then is the perfect fit for an Administrative Supplement – this is an opportunity to enhance the value of the parent study by adding new expertise to investigate in a complementary and valuable fashion a question that was already addressed by the parent grant. This Supplement builds on the same infrastructure and questions asked in Aim 2, but augments our analytical armamentarium with novel machine learning approaches. Project Narrative This Supplement proposal builds on the second aim of R01 AG 029672,  'ADNI Psychometrics (P Crane, PI) , which is to use ADNI's rich neuroimaging data to compare metabolism and brain structure correlates of cognitively defined Alzheimer's disease subgroups.

"UC Davis Alzheimer's Core Center PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT As reflected in recent budget increases in the National Institutes of Health, and in line with the National Alzheimer’s Project Act, there is a need to enhance and leverage resources to decrease dementia disparities and change the trajectory of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. To fill this gap, we seek to enhance the University of California Davis Alzheimer’s Disease Center (UCD ADC), which contains a diverse ethnoracial cohort (having Hispanic, Black, and non-Hispanic White decedents), through implementation of digital pathology within our Neuropathology Core. This implementation will allow for rapid transmission of pathological data for consultation and collaborations, distribution of materials for educational purposes, tissue specimen archiving, and image analysis. In addition, by having a digital pathology with immunofluorescent capabilities will allow for viewing of the distribution (including overlap) of multiple proteins at one time within a tissue specimen. This can enhance biological studies by providing spatial relationships of proteins resulting in a deeper phenotype of disease. This supplement application is designed to support equipment and leverage and enhance infrastructure to allow the UCD ADC the ability to 1) purchase a whole slide image system to digitize existing and future histologically stained samples 2) leverage and enhance current servers and database systems to allow for storage and rapid retrieval of digital images and their data and 3) leverage and enhance hardware to develop and deploy pipelines for quantitative computational methodologies for pathologies found within a diverse ethnoracial cohort of Alzheimer’s disease brains. The UCD ADC continues to excel and expand in its research initiatives to collect and provide brain specimens and pathological data on a diverse population of individuals at various stages of cognitive ability and dementia risk. This supplement will further enable suitable infrastructure for enhancement of current collaborations and facilitate emerging collaborations by providing a means to share and analysis pathology on digitized whole slide images. PROJECT NARRATIVE Digital microscopy paired with machine learning algorithms has aided in diagnosis and provide more quantitative pathology data to unlock the secrets of diseases. These technologies are needed within the dementia field, specifically in diverse cohorts, as disease presentations may differ. By implementing state of the art imaging systems and analysis, the goals of this supplement are to enhance the ADC’s ability to provide greater access to high quality pathological data for educational, consultation and collaborative purposes, infrastructure to pursue digital solutions for more quantitative analysis, and safe secure storage of histologic specimens.",UC Davis Alzheimer's Core Center,9852188,P30AG010129,"['Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Archives', 'Autopsy', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Budgets', 'California', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Database Management Systems', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Educational Materials', 'Equipment', 'Extramural Activities', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Glass', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Infusion procedures', 'Knowledge', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Senile Plaques', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Systems Analysis', 'Technology', 'Thioflavin S', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'beta pleated sheet', 'cognitive ability', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'disease phenotype', 'histological specimens', 'histological stains', 'human tissue', 'imaging system', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuropathology', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'spatial relationship', 'synergism', 'transmission process', 'whole slide imaging']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,P30,2019,289154,254622553,-0.04401468155703384
"Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets Project Summary  Morphometric analysis is a primary algorithmic tool to discover disease and drug related effects on brain anatomy. Neurological degeneration and disease manifest in subtle and varied changes in brain anatomy that can be non-local in nature and effect amounts of white and gray matter as well as relative positioning and shapes of local brain anatomy. State-of-the-art morphometry methods focus on local matter distribution or on shape variations of apriori selected anatomies but have difficulty in detecting global or regional deterioration of matter; an important effect in many neurodegenerative processes. The proposal team recently developed a morphometric analysis based on unbalanced optimal transport, called UTM, that promises to be capable to discover local and global alteration of matter without the need to apriori select an anatomical region of interest.  The goal of this proposal is to develop the UTM technology into a software tool for automated high-throughput screening of large neurological image data sets. ​A more sensitive automated morphometric analysis tool will help researchers to discover neurological effects related to disease and lead to more efficient screening for drug related effects. Project Narrative  Describing anatomical differences in neurological image data set is a key technology to non-invasively discover the effects of disease processes or drug treatments on brain anatomy. Current morphometric analysis focus on local matter composition and on the shape of a priori defined regions of interest. The goal of this proposal is to extend the capabilities of image based morphometric analysis to be able to discover regionally varying deterioration and alteration of matter without the need for fine-grained segmentations and a priori definitions of regions of interest.",Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets,9787575,R41MH118845,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Effect', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'high throughput screening', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'morphometry', 'nervous system disorder', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'research and development', 'shape analysis', 'software development', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'web services', 'white matter']",NIMH,"KITWARE, INC.",R41,2019,291536,5161939,-0.003931114232861853
"High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is in response to PA 18-484. In the BRAIN 2025 Report, PET (positron emission tomography) is identified as “the best means to translate studies of neurotransmitters, receptors, and neuromodulators to humans.” However dynamic assessment of receptor occupancy and metabolism is hindered by the spatial resolution and sensitivity of even the most modern of clinically available PET scanners. To address this challenge, we propose a next generation PET detector with a highly innovative design: a detector module with a layered scintillator structure and a side readout configuration. The crystal slabs in the module are stacked along the depth direction and are optically separated by reflective films. The scintillation light created in each layer is measured by photodetectors located on the four sides of the crystal. Compared with traditional PET detectors, which contain pixelated crystal arrays, the new design has the following advantages: (1) The layered structure provides depth of interaction (DOI) information such that a smaller diameter detector ring can be used without increasing parallax error, increasing sensitivity while lowering costs. (2) The four-sided readout method improves the energy resolution of the system with increased scintillation light collection efficiency by reducing light loss due to total internal reflection. (3) Sub millimeter spatial resolution is achievable without using very small pitch crystal arrays, since the interaction location in each crystal layer is determined via machine learning- based decoding of the light distribution collected on the four crystal sides. Therefore the production cost of the crystals is reduced. (4) Since the interaction location and energy resolution for each layer are determined independently, the system sensitivity can be increased by stacking more layers in the module without affecting the spatial and energy resolution of the system. (5) For side readout setup, a larger ratio of cross-sectional area to length requires fewer photodetectors to cover all four sides of the module; this reduces photodetector cost. The first four points above have been demonstrated in preliminary studies using a small, prototype module. We propose to build a large scale detector module with this new design to verify the fifth advantage, and to study the effect of detector size on the first four. The outcome of this proposal will be two DOI enabled detector modules with excellent spatial resolution (~1 mm) and energy resolution (~10%), as well as good timing resolution (~400 ps), and DOI resolution (~ 3 mm) and high system sensitivity. A full characterization study for the two modules and imaging studies for both the Derenzo and Hoffman brain phantoms will address the current limitations of human brain PET scanners, and will serve as the foundation for a new dynamic PET scanner for neuroimaging. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop a novel design for detector modules used in brain-dedicated PET system with good spatial resolution, energy resolution, timing resolution, and DOI resolution, as well as high sensitivity. If successful, the study will pave the way for building a novel PET system for greatly improved dynamic PET imaging of the human brain.",High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging,9802309,R01EB028337,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Crystallization', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Film', 'Foundations', 'Gamma Rays', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurotransmitter Receptor', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Portugal', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Production', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Thinness', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'base', 'brain size', 'cost', 'design', 'detector', 'human imaging', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'millimeter', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'photomultiplier', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'response', 'retinal rods']",NIBIB,"CANON MEDICAL RESEARCH USA, INC.",R01,2019,293568,243919,0.008485487453061994
"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,9702876,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical translation', 'data mining', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'surgery outcome', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,328340,641965656,0.02416399865290204
"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these challenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymorphisms, whole brain neuroimaging, biofluids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mechanisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Specifically, in Aim 1, we develop efficient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation models to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efficiency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-specific substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic systems through ordinary differential equations with random inflections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker profiles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efficient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individualized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest benefit from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art analytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research community. Project Narrative:  The ultimate goal of neuropsychiatric research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay disease on- set, slow disease progression, and provide effective treatment at each stage of disease. This proposal aims to develop new statistical approaches to integrate complementary sources of information from genomic measures, brain imaging biomarkers, and early clinical signs to characterize disease mechanism, progression, and treatment responses, and thereby inform the design of clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies.",Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures,9694287,R01NS073671,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hazard Models', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'minimal risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,340259,558628098,-0.015819407241280368
"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,9951760,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Women&apos', 's Health Nursing', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'motor symptom', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2019,366168,146629556,0.01768316713774747
"The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning - Project Summary. This project explores how humans learn at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this supports human intelligence. Human decisions are typically hierarchically structured: we make high-level decisions (making a cup of coffee), which constrain lower level decisions (grinding coffee beans, boiling water, etc.), which themselves constrain simpler and simpler decisions and motor actions. This hierarchy in decisions is paralleled by a hierarchy in our representation of our environment: some sensory signals trigger simple decisions (a red light signals a stop), while other signal a broader, more abstract behavioral change (rain signals a set of adaptations when driving). Thus, complex hierarchical structure underlies the way we respond to our environment in seemingly simple, everyday tasks. This ability is supported by the prefrontal cortex, which represents states and decisions at multiple degrees of hierarchical abstraction. My previous work shows that hierarchical representations support transfer and generalization while learning, an ability that artificial agents still struggle to match human performance in. However, how we learn to form these hierarchical representations is poorly understood, despite how crucial it is for human intelligence. The proposed work will examine how multiple, parallel hierarchical loops between prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia support reinforcement learning at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this promotes flexible behavior. To this end, we will address three aims: 1. We will show that the same reinforcement learning computations happen in parallel at multiple levels of abstraction, as hypothesized by our computational model of prefrontal- subcortical networks. 2. We will demonstrate that humans partition learning problems into multiple sequential subgoals so they can learn multiple simple strategies instead of one complex strategy, and that reusing these simple strategies promotes fast exploration and learning. 3. We will show that hierarchical learning does not rely exclusively on rewards, but that novelty signals are crucial for identifying subgoals and learning through curiosity. Across all three aims, we will use behavioral experiments in conjunction with computational modeling to characterize how humans learn hierarchically. In addition, we will use EEG and fMRI to identify the neural computations underlying the cognitive systems inferred from behavior and modeling. This project will provide new insights into the computational mechanisms that give rise to learning, and thus provide a better handle on the sources of learning dysfunction observed in many psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, ADHD, and OCD. Additionally, it will provide new tools, in the form of experimental protocols and precise computational models, for studying learning across populations and species. Project Narrative This proposal will explore how learning hierarchically structured representations of our environments helps humans adapt flexibly and efficiently to new situations. We will record how people learn to make simple decisions, observe changes in brain activity, and use mathematical models to study how hierarchical learning happens in the brain. This will help explain how human learning can be so efficient and flexible, how mental conditions such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety cause learning and decision-making impairments, and will help develop better treatments.",The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning,9728374,R01MH119383,"['Address', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Curiosities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Rain', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'bean', 'cognitive system', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'human model', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2019,381751,148186688,0.007453618967792071
"Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data 1. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The study of translational biomarkers in brain disorders is a very challenging and fruitful approach, which will empower a better understanding of healthy and diseased brains. This project will promote the translation of advanced engineering solutions and mathematic tools to novel neuroimaging applications in psychiatric disorders including major depression disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ), allowing sophisticated and powerful analyses on highly complex datasets. To date, the unifying syndrome classification (ICD-9/10;DSM-IV/5) for these mental disorders obscures our knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and cannot guide optimal treatments. For example, there is no biomarker that is able to precisely predict response of MDD to some treatments. One reason for this is that most neuroimaging prediction studies to date have used a single imaging measure or reported simple correlation relationships, without considering multimodal cross- information, nonlinear relationships, or multi-site cross-validation. Hence, developing novel data mining techniques such as deep learning, fusion with reference, and sparse regression can complement and exploit the richness of neuroimaging data, providing promising avenues to identify objective biomarkers and going beyond a descriptive use of brain imaging as traditionally used in studies of brain disease to individualized prediction. We will facilitate the translational biomarker identification by developing 3 novel data-driven methods: 1) A supervised fusion model that can provide insight on how cognitive impairment may affect covarying brain function and structure in mental disorder, by using different clinical measures as a reference to guide multimodal MRI fusion; 2) A cutting-edge prediction framework with aggregated feature selection techniques that is able to estimate clinical outcome more precisely, e.g., remission/relapse status of individual MDD patient after electroconvulsive treatment(ECT) using baseline brain imaging and demographic measures of 3) We will draw on advances and ideas from deep learning combined with layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) or attention modules, to classify multiple groups of psychiatric disorders by incorporating dynamic functional measures. The proposed (Deep/Recurrent/Convolutional Neural Network, DNN/RNN/CNN) models will have enhanced interpretability that is able to trace back and discover the most predictive functional networks from input. All above proposed methods will be applied to big data containing both multimodal imaging and behavioral information (n~5000) pooled from existing studies, and our developed open-source toolboxes will be shared publicly. This pioneering study may provide an urgently-needed paradigm shift in the treatment and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, thereby guiding personalized clinical care. Accomplishment of this project has great potential to discover neuroimaging biomarkers that have been missed by existing approaches, leading to earlier and more effective interventions, and laying the groundwork for a significant translational impact. Project Narrative Psychiatric imaging is struggling with identifying robust biomarkers. Existing approaches do not fully leverage the power of multimodal data, despite evidence that such information is highly informative. We will draw on advances and ideas from fields of deep learning, supervised learning and functional dynamics, to capture rich information from multimodal imaging big data, and to identify precise biomarkers that are able to predict clinical measures for new individuals and help for intervention. We will pool big data from ongoing projects in multiple cohorts, consisting of a big data with imaging and behavioral info to apply clinical applications that will have profound translational medicine impact on schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorders.",Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data,9818198,R01MH117107,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Engineering', 'Functional disorder', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Probability', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive ability', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'depressed patient', 'disease classification', 'effective intervention', 'flexibility', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'personalized predictions', 'predicting response', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'translational medicine', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,399485,43632870,0.023157451913001795
"Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract  The brain is extremely complex as we know, involving a complicated interplay between functional information interacting with a structural (but not static) substrate. Brain imaging technology provides a way to sample various aspects of the brain albeit incompletely, providing a rich set of multitask and multimodal information. The field has advanced significantly in its approach to multimodal data, as there are more studies correlating, e.g. func- tional and structural measures. However the vast majority of studies still ignore the joint information among two or more modalities or tasks. Such information is critical to consider as each brain imaging modality reports on a different aspect of the brain (e.g. gray matter integrity, blood flow changes, white matter integrity). The field is still striving to understand how to diagnose and treat complex mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and others, and ignoring the joint information among tasks and modalities is to miss a critical, but available, part of the puzzle. Combining multimodal imaging data is not easy since, among other reasons, the combination of multiple data sets consisting of thousands of voxels or timepoints yields a very high dimensional problem, requiring appropriate data reduction strategies. In the previous phase of the project we developed approaches based on multiset canonical correlation analysis (mCCA) and joint independent compo- nent analysis (jICA) that can capture high-dimensional, linear, relationships among 2 or more modalities, and which we showed can identify both modality-unique and modality-common features that are predictive of dis- ease. In this new phase of the project we will focus on two important areas. First, we will build on our previous success by extending our models to allow for incorporation of behavioral/cognitive constraints as well as devel- oping new approaches which leverage recent advances in deep learning enabling us to capture higher order relationships embedded in multimodal and multitask data. Secondly, we will address the key challenge of inte- grating possibly thousands of multimodal features by developing a new meta-modality framework which will enable us to bring together the existing and new features in an intuitive manner. This will also enable us to capture changes in multimodal information which might not be harmful separately but which together are jointly sufficient to convey risk of illness or to identify information flow through the meta-modal space for developing potential targets for treatment. We will apply these approaches to one of the largest multimodal imaging datasets of psychosis and mood disorders. Our proposed approach will be thoroughly evaluated using this large data set which includes multiple illnesses that have overlapping symptoms and which can sometimes be misdiagnosed and treated with the wrong medications for months or years (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar de- pression). As before, we will provide open source tools and release data throughout the duration of the project via a web portal and the NITRIC repository, hence enabling other investigators to compare their own methods with our own as well as to apply them to a large variety of brain disorders. 36 Project Narrative  The promise of multimodal imaging is clear, and we have shown the power of linear joint N-way analysis during the previous funding period. However this is just the beginning. In this renewal, we will build on and significantly expand the goals of the original aims by incorporating additional joint information (including dynamic and potentially nonlinear factors) as well as a framework for integrating the resulting information in order to enable decision making and identification of potential targets for further study or possible treatment. We will also disseminate our approaches through software tools and interactive web-based visualization of available data. 37",Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers,9776502,R01EB006841,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Tars', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'data reduction', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'patient subsets', 'potential biomarker', 'repository', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'web portal', 'white matter']",NIBIB,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,400000,43632870,0.020614210672416935
"Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and demographic data to predict future cognitive decline toward dementia ABSTRACT The “preclinical” phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by abnormal levels of brain amyloid accumulation in the absence of major symptoms, can last decades, and potentially holds the key to successful therapeutic strategies. Today there is an urgent need for quantitative biomarkers and genetic tests that can predict clinical progression at the individual level. This project will develop cutting edge machine learning algorithms that will mine high dimensional, multi-modal, and longitudinal data to derive models that yield individual-level clinical predictions in the context of dementia. The developed prognostic models will specifically utilize ubiquitous and affordable data types: structural brain MRI scans, saliva or blood-derived genome-wide sequence data, and demographic variables (age, education, and sex). Prior research has demonstrated that all these variables are strongly associated with clinical decline to dementia, however to date we have no model that can harvest all the predictive information embedded in these high dimensional data. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used to compute clinical predictions from high- dimensional biomedical data such as clinical scans. Yet, most prior ML methods were developed for applications where the ``prediction’’ task was about concurrent condition (e.g., discriminate cases and controls); and established risk factors (e.g., age), multiple modalities (e.g., genotype and images) and longitudinal data were not fully exploited. This application’s core innovation will be to develop rigorous, flexible, and practical ML methods that can fully exploit multi-modal, longitudinal, and high- dimensional biomedical data to compute prognostic clinical predictions. The proposed project will build on the PI’s strong background in computational modeling and analysis of large-scale biomedical data. We will employ an innovative Bayesian ML framework that offers the flexibility to handle and exploit real-life longitudinal and multi-modal data. We hypothesize that the developed models will be more useful than alternative benchmarks for identifying preclinical individuals who are at heightened risk of imminent clinical decline. We will use a statistically rigorous approach for discovery, cross-validation, and benchmarking the developed tools. This project will yield freely distributed, documented, and validated software and models for predicting future clinical progression based on whole-genome, longitudinal structural MRI and demographic data. We believe the algorithms and software we develop will yield invaluable tools for stratifying preclinical AD subjects in drug trials, optimizing future therapies, and minimizing the risk of adverse effects. NARRATIVE Emerging technologies allow us to identify clinically healthy subjects harboring Alzheimer’s pathology. While many of these preclinical individuals progress to dementia, sometimes quite quickly, others remain asymptomatic for decades. The proposed project will develop sophisticated data mining algorithms to derive models that can predict future clinical decline based on ubiquitous, easy- to-collect, and affordable data modalities: brain MRI scans, saliva or blood- derived whole-genome sequences, and clinical and demographic variables.","Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and demographic data to predict future cognitive decline toward dementia",9731367,R01AG053949,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anatomy', 'Bayesian learning', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Harvest', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Prevention approach', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Saliva', 'Scanning', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'aging brain', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'case control', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive testing', 'data mining', 'flexibility', 'functional disability', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'risk minimization', 'serial imaging', 'sex', 'software development', 'sound', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NIA,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,410000,91477866,-0.0601268231723829
"The Gut Microbiome in Parkinson Disease Project Summary/Abstract This is a first R01 application from an early stage, new investigator and current NIEHS K01 awardee. Parkinson disease (PD) is a disabling neurodegenerative disease for which there is no cure. Years before the diagnosis of PD and the onset of motor symptoms, PD patients develop non-motor symptoms, including, importantly, constipation and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Constipation affects over 80% of PD patients and is one of the strongest risk factors for PD. Recent research shows that the enteric nervous system in the gut and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve which anatomically links the GI system to the brain, are among the first and most severely affected by alpha-synuclein pathology characteristic of PD5 leading to the hypothesis that the gastrointestinal tract might be the site of initiation of PD. We propose to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the relation between human gut microbiome and PD, focusing on the pre- onset microbiome. We will do this by building on an ongoing Department of Defense funded project that has identified participants with pre-parkinson syndrome (PPS - defined as the co- occurrence of constipation, pRBD (probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder) and hyposmia) that in a pilot study has been associated with a ~200 fold increase in PD risk. Studying the microbiome among this group, who are highly likely to develop PD or are already in the premotor state, will give us a unique look at the microbiome in PD patients prior to any potential disease-associated effects of changes in diet and lifestyle that may have confounded prior case-control studies. The proposed study will take advantage of 25 years of prospectively collected data on environmental and dietary exposures and disease outcomes in two prospective cohorts of men and women. Project Narrative Our appreciation of the impact of the gut microbiome on brain health, and especially PD, is in the early stages. This study will be the first to examine the gut microbiome in participants with premotor PD and compare it to healthy controls, controls with constipation and to recently onset PD cases. This project will thus advance our understanding of how the human gut microbiome contributes to the pathophysiology of PD and will contribute to the development of tools needed for a preclinical diagnosis and/or treatment.",The Gut Microbiome in Parkinson Disease,9606513,R01NS097723,"['Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Bacteria', 'Biometry', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Butyrates', 'Caffeine', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Constipation', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Department of Defense', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Enteric Nervous System', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Feces', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gait', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genes', 'Health Professional', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Mucous Membrane', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Onset of illness', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Pilot Projects', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Proteobacteria', 'REM Sleep Behavior Disorder', 'Ralstonia', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Update', 'Vagus nerve structure', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Woman', 'alpha synuclein', 'brain health', 'cigarette smoking', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'dorsal motor nucleus', 'dysbiosis', 'follow-up', 'gastrointestinal', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'hyposmia', 'illness length', 'men', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiome research', 'microbiota profiles', 'motor symptom', 'non-motor symptom', 'posture instability', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive signature', 'prospective', 'stool sample', 'tool development']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R01,2019,422761,7208224,0.02464099264154083
"Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by  Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging can provide safe, non-invasive, and whole-brain measurements for large clinical and research studies of brain disorders. However, many disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alterations, which are often difficult to tease out due to limited image quality afforded by the popular 3T MRI scanners (with 20,000+ units available worldwide). Although 7T MRI scanners provide better image quality, these ultrahigh field scanners are not widely available (with only 40+ units available worldwide) and are also not used clinically. Thus, tools for reconstructing 7T-like high-quality MRI from 3T MRI scan are highly desirable. A means for achieving this is by learning the relationship between 3T and 7T MRI scans from training samples. This renewal project is dedicated to developing a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels of 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD. Specifically, (Aim 1) to enhance the image quality of 3T MRI, we will develop a novel deep learning architecture to learn a complex multi-layer 3T-to-7T mapping from training subjects, each with coupled 3T and 7T MRI scans. This mapping will then be applied to reconstruct quality-enhanced 7T-like MRI scans from new 3T MRI scans. (Aim 2) For brain structural measurement (e.g., brain atrophies, and hippocampal volume shrinkage), a crucial step is brain tissue segmentation. We will thus develop a robust and accurate random forest tissue segmentation method, which maps 7T label information to 3T scans. The mapping function is trained using tissue labels generated for 7T scans, instead of 3T scans which often have limited image contrast. (Aim 3) To further quantify local atrophies in ROIs or even sub-ROIs (i.e., hippocampal subfields), we will develop a deformable multi-ROI segmentation method by employing (a) random forest to predict deformation from each image location to the target boundary by adaptive integration of multimodal (anatomical, structural & functional connectivity) information and (b) auto-context model to iteratively refine ROI segmentation results. Note that the adaptive integration of multimodal MRI data, especially resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), is critical to the segmentation of sub-ROIs such as hippocampal subfields, since local functional connectivity patterns can help distinguish boundaries between neighboring subfields that often have different cortico-cortical connections. (Aim 4) Finally, by integrating anatomical features from all accurately segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs and also structural & functional connectivity features between those segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs, we can more effectively detect early-stage brain disorders, i.e., the conversion of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD. We will integrate information from different imaging datasets and multiple imaging centers by using our novel multi-task learning approach for jointly learning the respective disease prediction models. Applications. These computational methods will find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormalities associated with various neurological diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia), measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between imaging and clinical scores. Narrative Description of Project The goal of this renewal project is to achieve robust brain measurements from the routine 3T MRI, guided by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI. To this end, we will create a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels from 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new testing subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD.",Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI,9698938,R01EB006733,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Atrophic', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain tissue', 'cerebral atrophy', 'contrast imaging', 'deep learning', 'disease diagnosis', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multi-task learning', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'random forest', 'research study', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,446909,511185245,-0.007038311952502387
"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research. We develop new knowledge and a novel tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding volunteers in innovative neuroscience research, to ensure ethical participation, enhance trust in science, and accelerate discovery.",Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain,9741540,R01MH114856,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell model', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Human Volunteers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Personhood', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'brain research', 'clinical care', 'decision research', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'insight', 'member', 'neuroethics', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'patient engagement', 'prevent', 'programs', 'sound', 'standard measure', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'volunteer']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,459850,560644462,0.024940801571904783
"Quantitative analysis of estrogen and sleep deprivation-induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling in the brain system Abstract Numerous small vessels making up the central nervous system blood and lymphatic vascular networks are heterogeneous and region-specific dynamic structures, whose segments, position, shape and function can change in response to physiological and pathophysiological conditions. To date it has not been possible to integrate blood and lymphatic vascular elements and their microenvironment to achieve a holistic quantitative characterization of the combined brain and meningeal tissue-scale vascular networks, its structure and function in normal and disease states. This application proposes to develop microscopy- based high-throughput image analysis techniques for automated extraction of blood and lymphatic vascular networks enabling quantitative morphodynamic characterization of cerebrovascular microenvironment changes in two intracranial compartments – the brain and dura mater. The study will focus on new algorithms for precise region-specific microvessel registration, mosaicing, segmentation, fusion and colocalization for constructing large tissue scale spatially aligned dual blood/lymphatic vascular network structural maps in the animals of both sexes, as well as characterization of heterogeneities of microvascular networks, including blood and lymphatic vasculature, under estrogen and sleep deprivation (the conditions relevant to multiple cerebrovascular disorders) compared to physiological settings. In other words, advanced microscopy-based techniques will be used to image blood and lymphatic vessels at sub-micron resolution in dura mater and the brain, and then cutting-edge deep machine learning imaging analysis methods will be employed to segment and quantify these vessels, their geometry, vessel wall structure, functionality, and interrelationship. Detailed structural analysis of microvascular networks is essential for accurate evaluation of the distribution of physical forces, substrate delivery and tissue clearance of waste, as well as sex differences and consequences of intracranial networks remodeling under physiological and pathological conditions. This will create knowledge enabling a better understanding of the pathogenesis of vascular impairments under estrogen and sleep deprivation, identify common molecular mechanisms and the efficacy and effectiveness of different therapeutic treatments. Without the ability to construct total structural and functional blood/lymphatic vascular network maps from studies limited to individual tissue component parts, it is little wonder that translation from the molecular and cellular levels to the whole organ and system levels is deficient and hinders translational progress towards a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology associated with a range of neurological disorders. Detailed analysis of structural relationships of both blood and lymphatic circulation in the brain system will have a direct impact on our general understanding of vascular function in brain/meningeal communication, and the cause and resolution of numerous diseases resulting from intracranial vascular disorders including impact of sex hormone (estrogen) deprivation, sleep deprivation, migraines, stroke, multiple sclerosis, dural arterio-venous fistulae, intradural hygroma and hematoma, spontaneous cerebral spinal fluid leaks, and intradural aneurysms that can lead to the development of neurological and cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer's. Quantitative description of blood and lymphatic vessel network structures using image analytics and machine learning algorithms distributed as software tools will have broad applications to quantification of other thin complex curvilinear anatomical structures (i.e. nerves, neuronal circuits, neurons, and neuroglia). The new software for blood and vessel network measurement will enable translation of fundamental pathophysiological knowledge gained from this proposal towards the development and assessment of the effectiveness of treatments and therapeutic interventions to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability associated with a range of neurological disorders.",Quantitative analysis of estrogen and sleep deprivation-induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling in the brain system,9712424,R01NS110915,"['Acute', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Aneurysm', 'Animals', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Insomnia', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cystic Lymphangioma', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dura Mater', 'Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Estrogens', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional disorder', 'Geometry', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Health', 'Hematoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lymphatic', 'Lymphatic vessel', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meningeal', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Migraine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Nerve', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Parietal', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Sex Differences', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Software Tools', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Subdural Hematoma', 'Subdural Hygroma', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinness', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Vascular resistance', 'Venous', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'body system', 'cerebral microvasculature', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinically relevant', 'confocal imaging', 'deep learning', 'deprivation', 'disability', 'geometric structure', 'in vivo', 'lymphatic circulation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'microleakage', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuronal circuitry', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'response', 'sex', 'sleep pattern', 'solute', 'stem', 'submicron', 'tool', 'wasting']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2019,540520,63611576,0.01584280032488056
"Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets Project Summary During the past three decades non-invasive functional brain imaging has developed immensely in terms of measurement technologies, analysis methods, and innovative paradigms to capture information about brain function both in healthy and diseased individuals. Although functional MRI (fMRI) has become very useful, it only provides indirect information about neuronal activity through the neurovascular coupling with a limited temporal resolution. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) remain the only available noninvasive techniques capable of directly measuring the electrophysiological activity with a millisecond resolution. During the past eight years we have developed, with NIH support, the MNE-Python software, which covers multiple methods of data preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. To further extend our software to meet the needs of a growing user base and reflect recent developments in the MEG/EEG field we will pursue three specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will: (i) Create an all-embracing suite of noise cancellation tools incorporating and extending methods present in different MEG systems; (ii) Implement device independent methods for head-movement determination and compensation on the basis of head movement data recorded during a MEG session; (iii) Develop methods for automatic tagging of artifacts using machine learning approaches. In Aim 2 our focus is to extend the software to make modern distributed computing resources easily usable in processing and to allow for remote visualization without the need to move large amounts of data across the network. Finally, in Aim 3, we will continue to develop MNE-Python using best programming practices ensuring multiplatform compatibility, extensive web-based documentation, training and forums, and hands-on training workshops. As a result of these developments the MNE-Python will be able to effectively process large number of subjects and huge amounts data ensuing and from multi-site studies harmoniously across different MEG/EEG systems. Narrative MEG and EEG can be used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. However, widespread use of these methods especially in large populations has been problematic because of the lack of well-established analysis approaches, which map the sensor data into the brain space for detailed temporal, spatial, and connectivity analysis. This research will provide well-documented and tested novel analysis software to promote both basic neuroscience and clinical research applications using MEG and EEG.",Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets,9750274,R01NS104585,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Experimental Designs', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Language Development', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Online Systems', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization software', 'Writing', 'analysis pipeline', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cluster computing', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'falls', 'human data', 'innovation', 'millisecond', 'multithreading', 'neurovascular coupling', 'novel', 'open source', 'pedagogy', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'software development', 'source localization', 'symposium', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'verification and validation']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,543993,551214295,0.0044521188942707336
"Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular interactions with the environment form the basis of health and disease for all organisms. Exposure to nutrients, toxins, and neighboring cells trigger coordinated molecular responses that impact cell function and metabolism in a beneficial, adaptive, or detrimental manner. Although the benefits of multicellularity for the formation of complex tissue structures or the function of entire organ systems has been long appreciated, it has only recently been understood that microbial inhabitants of vertebrates also have a tremendous impact on host cell function and dysfunction. Despite this, an understanding of these interactions has not moved beyond simple associations, and there are virtually no molecular technologies available that adequately define how a complex microbial ecosystem impacts host cell function, or how the host response to microbial colonization affects the bacterial community. This gap in knowledge is striking when one considers the broad and significant impact that microbes have on human health. In this application, we propose to expressly fill this knowledge gap through development of a novel multimodal imaging pipeline that will provide 3-dimensional information on the molecular heterogeneity of microbial communities and the immune response at the host-pathogen interface.  This proposal combines our expertise in immunology, infection biology, mass spectrometry, small animal imaging, machine learning, and computer vision to develop an integrated multimodal visualization method for studying infectious disease. Our unique approach will computationally combine ultra-high speed (~50px/s) MALDI-TOF images, ultra-high mass resolution (>200,000 resolving power) MALDI FTICR IMS, metal imaging by LA-ICP-IMS, high-spatial resolution optical microscopy, and MR imaging using data-driven image fusion. This strategy will enable 3-D molecular images to be generated for thousands of elements, metabolites, lipids, and proteins with an unprecedented combination of chemical specificity and spatial fidelity more than 50x faster than is currently possible. We will use this next-generation imaging capability to (i) define the heterogeneous microbial subpopulations throughout the 3-D volume of a S. aureus community, (ii) uncover the host molecules that form the abscess and accumulate to restrict microbial growth in murine models, and (iii) elucidate molecular markers that differentiate in vivo biofilms at the host-pathogen interface, between abscesses at various stages of progression, and under distinct degrees of nutrient stress. These studies will uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will enable detailed views of the molecular components of infectious disease with unprecedented resolution through the development of a multimodal, 3-dimensional imaging platform. The proposed technologies will improve throughput and molecular specificity, enable automated high-precision and high-accuracy image alignment, and allow for descriptions of molecular signals in 3-D through the fusion of multi-modal imaging data. These studies will uncover targets for therapeutic intervention and antibiotic development and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research.",Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry,9788239,R01AI138581,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abscess', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance', 'Functional disorder', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nutrient', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'animal imaging', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'body system', 'commensal bacteria', 'experimental study', 'host colonization', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbial community', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'protein expression', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'virtual']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,562232,377931988,-0.013638435752697294
"Discovering the rules for the organization of macaque inferotemporal cortex. Project Summary How is the representation of complex visual objects organized in inferotemporal (IT) cortex, the large brain region responsible for object recognition? To date, areas selective for a few categories such as faces, bodies, and scenes have been found, but the vast majority of IT cortex is “wild,” lacking any known specialization. Various schemes have been proposed for parceling IT, but a comprehensive understanding of IT organization remains elusive. Here, we propose to use fMRI, microstimulation, and electrophysiology to develop a unified understanding of the organization and coding principles of macaque IT. The experiments are motivated by a major advance in computer vision and two key preliminary results from our lab. First, the advent of deep networks trained for object classification makes it possible to generate a parametric object space, providing a quantitative framework to decipher the feature selectivity of single IT cells. Second, our preliminary results suggest that a large portion of macaque IT cortex is topographically organized according to the first two principal components of object space. This topography encompasses at least four distinct networks, each with at least three hierarchical nodes of increasing view invariance, and includes the previously described face and body patch networks. Furthermore, single cells within each network are projecting incoming objects, formatted as vectors in the object space, onto specific preferred axes. Taken together, these results suggest a new hypothesis for IT organization: IT cortex is tiled by networks (i.e., sets of functionally connected nodes, where a node is a patch of IT cells) whose organization and coding principles are very similar to that of the face patch network, and the layout of these networks follows a regular topography specified by the statistical structure of object space. We propose three Specific Aims to rigorously test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will systematically map all networks within IT of individual animals. In Aim 2, we will record responses of cells in each identified network to a large, common set of object stimuli and determine their coding scheme. In Aim 3, we will perturb activity in each network and quantitatively assess effect on object recognition behavior. Together, these three Aims seek to build a comprehensive understanding of IT organization that bridges fMRI, single units, and behavior. Our lab has developed powerful experimental techniques to tackle each of these Aims and has previously applied them to the macaque face patch system. We believe the time is ripe to apply these techniques to the larger problem of how all objects are represented--not just faces. In the same way that Mendeleev’s arrangement of chemical elements according to their atomic mass and chemical properties helped elucidate the electronic structure of atoms, we believe systematic mapping and characterization of all networks in IT will help elucidate the fundamental neural mechanism for object recognition. Narrative This basic research application will investigate how visual objects are processed by the brain. The brain areas we will study are located in the temporal lobe, a brain region especially susceptible to neurological disease including Alzheimer’s disease and epilepsy. The planned studies will provide valuable insight into the fundamental code cells in this region use to represent visual information, and will thereby contribute to better understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases targeting this part of the brain.",Discovering the rules for the organization of macaque inferotemporal cortex.,9803682,R01EY030650,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Epilepsy', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glean', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Macaca', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Monkeys', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'chemical property', 'electronic structure', 'experimental study', 'inferotemporal cortex', 'insight', 'microstimulation', 'movie', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuromechanism', 'object perception', 'object recognition', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'vector', 'visual information']",NEI,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,575750,81181560,-0.005036428296738113
"Defining the anatomical, molecular and functional logic of internal copy circuits involved in dexterous forelimb behaviors Project Summary Behavior is movement, and the effective and efficient execution of movement has served as a fundamental evolutionary force shaping the form and function of the nervous system. Control of the forelimbs to interact with the world is one of the most essential achievements of the mammalian motor system, yet unfortunately these behaviors are particularly vulnerable to disease and injury. The execution of skilled limb movements requires the continuous refinement of motor output across dozens of muscles, suggesting the existence of feedback pathways that enable rapid adjustments. The temporal delays of peripheral pathways, however, suggest that sensory feedback alone cannot explain the sophistication of online motor control. In principle, a more rapid source of feedback would be to convey copies of motor commands internally to the cerebellum to generate predictions of motor outcome, reducing dependence on delayed sensory information. Yet putative copy circuits have been difficult to isolate experimentally, leaving their contributions to movement unclear. Mouse genetic tools offer a means to explore a diverse class of spinal interneurons as a neural substrate for internal copies. Cervical propriospinal neurons (PNs) receive descending motor command input and extend bifurcating axons; one branch projects to forelimb motor neurons and the other projects to the lateral reticular nucleus (LRN), a major cerebellar input, providing an anatomically straightforward means to convey motor copies internally. Yet how diverse classes of PN-LRN circuits are organized and how they each contribute to distinct elements of limb behavior remain unclear. Complicating the problem, the field lacks robust ways for deconstructing complex limb movements into component elements (e.g. reaching, grasping, postural control), and objective means for quantifying these behaviors in mice. Hypothesis: Discrete classes of PN circuits convey distinct types of spinal motor copy information to the LRN, each necessary for separate aspects of forelimb control; this functional logic can be resolved with more quantitative, high-resolution and standardized behavioral assays. To test this overarching hypothesis, Aim 1 uses molecular-genetic circuit mapping approaches and single-cell RNA- sequencing to define the anatomical and molecular organization of four classes of PN-LRN circuits. Identifying the fine-grained structure of these diverse pathways will be essential for establishing how internal copies are conveyed to the cerebellum to control forelimb behavior. Aim 2 addresses the need for more sensitive and unbiased behavioral tools by developing novel assays of discrete elements of forelimb behavior and machine learning approaches for automated quantification of forelimb kinematics. Finally, Aim 3 merges these novel behavioral approaches with intersectional genetic tools, electrophysiological recording and circuit-specific perturbation to functionally dissect PN-LRN circuits and define their modular contributions to dexterous limb control. Ultimately, these studies will yield insight into the function of internal copy circuits throughout the nervous system, and help to lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits. Project Narrative In addition to promoting basic science investigation of motor function, this work can impact the study of motor dysfunction. Skilled movements of the arm and hand are particularly susceptible to disease and injury of the motor system, raising the need for a better understanding of motor circuit organization and more informative strategies for studying the behaviors these circuits control. Merging molecular-genetic tools with novel behavioral approaches will offer a more detailed and comprehensive approach to studying movement, helping to provide greater insight into the neural basis of motor deficits as well as more effective ways to restore or replace lost motor function.","Defining the anatomical, molecular and functional logic of internal copy circuits involved in dexterous forelimb behaviors",9739115,R01NS111479,"['Ablation', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Axon', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cerebellum', 'Cervical', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Distal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Forelimb', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interneurons', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Limb structure', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Structure', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Equilibrium', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Rabies', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Spinal', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Viral', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'arm movement', 'behavioral study', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'improved', 'insight', 'intersectionality', 'kinematics', 'limb movement', 'molecular subtypes', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'motor disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory feedback', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,R01,2019,579461,65771974,-0.0070669600770159715
"MR Fingerprinting for Epilepsy Abstract Epilepsy affects 65 million people worldwide; approximately 30% of them do not respond to medications but can be cured by surgery. Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a major pathology for medically intractable epilepsies, is frequently missed by visual analysis of the conventional MRI, making surgical treatment very difficult. We propose to develop a novel quantitative MRI acquisition and analysis framework specific for epilepsy patients, which could provide more sensitive and specific measures of brain structure, thereby improving FCD detection and subtype prediction. To this end, the quantitative framework will be developed and validated in three steps: (1) Develop high-resolution Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) scan that allows simultaneous quantification of multiple tissue property maps efficiently, accurately and precisely. These quantitative maps have shown to be more sensitive and specific on detecting and characterizing subtle signal abnormalities. (2) Develop image post-processing methods to analyze quantitative maps, which will provide quantitative measurements that highlight additional morphological features, such as gray-white boundary blurring, abnormal cortical thickness and folding. (3) Develop machine-learning-based feature screening and prediction tools to characterize group-level features differentiating FCD subtypes, and predict individual-level FCD location and subtyping. Because detection and subtype prediction of FCD are both associated with seizure outcomes, epileptologists can use this tool to provide more personalized and customized counseling. The result of our proposed work promises a paradigm shift by converting the current standard-care of visual/qualitative MRI review to a quantitative framework, including data acquisition, post-processing and decision support tool, that would eventually lead to better treatment planning, reduction in unnecessary pre-surgical evaluation tests (especially invasive evaluation), and improved post-operative seizure outcomes in patients with devastating and disabling medically intractable epilepsy. The quantitative nature of our acquisition/analysis methods also makes it possible to be uniformly adopted by other centers with high consistency.

"Deep Learning Algorithms for FreeSurfer Abstract FreeSurfer is a tool for the analysis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) that has proven to be a flexible and powerful technology for quantifying the effects of many conditions, including numerous neurological disorders, on human brain anatomy, connectivity, vasculature, chemical composition, physiology and function. In the past 20 years, these open source tools have been developed to accurately and automatically segment an array of brain structures. In this project, we seek the resources to radically increase the speed, accuracy and flexibility of these tools, taking advantage of exciting new results in Deep Learning. This will enable us to more accurately quantify neuroanatomical changes that are critical to diagnosing, staging and assessing the efficacy of potential therapeutic interventions in diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.

"High resolution mapping of the genetic risk for disease in the aging brain ABSTRACT Brain structure undergoes changes throughout life as part of the normal healthy aging process, yet some genetic factors embedded in our DNA are believed to alter and potentially accelerate the aging process within the brain. While numerous neuroimaging studies have aimed to map the genetics of dementia, differences in populations and approaches confounded with the small effect sizes attributable to any single genetic variant leads to inconsistencies in findings and limited resources to investigate the truth. Dozens of neuroimaging genetic studies have been collected around the world to help better understand the link. However, the independent nature by which the studies often operate may be limiting scientific advance. Instead of collecting new data to answer the same questions, we harmonize brain mapping efforts across existing studies and pool information to not only study differences between the healthy and demented brain, but also examine normal healthy aging trends, and determine the first signs of deviation, and map out the neurobiological effect of genes that confer risk for dementia. In our effort, we aim to pinpoint mechanistic trajectories and brain circuits by which the widely studied ApoE4 genetic haplotype affects brain throughout life. Despite being identified as a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease over 20 years ago, the effects on the brain in populations around the world are remarkably inconsistent. With novel brain mapping techniques across tens of thousands of individuals across the lifespan, we will perform the most well powered brain mapping initiative and build necessary tools to invite other researchers from around the world to add confidence to the findings. We will also determine – with unprecedented power -- how the aggregate risk for AD promotes accelerated brain degeneration with novel expedited longitudinal linear mixed modeling techniques for large scale epidemiological genetic studies with repeat data. Our proposal brings together contributions from multidisciplinary collaborators with world renowned expertise in neurodegeneration, brain mapping, big data, artificial intelligence, epidemiology, genomics and epigenomes, statistical genetics, and molecular and biological psychiatry. Our technical expertise will provide resources for visualizing genetic results at the finest resolution and provide tools for researchers to use our harmonized analyses to structure their own aging hypotheses in populations of men and women around the world, and even target sex-specific hypotheses in aging. As new brain imaging and genetic data is becoming rapidly available, we provide the tools to harmonize the data into this workflow for years to come. Driven by the data sharing and reuse of this proposal, we provide a portal for researchers of today and tomorrow to access findings from all the studies incorporated in this proposal and add to the collective repository of effects. We hope our careful harmonization of data, along with novel mathematics, tools, and selection of targeted hypotheses will guide future collaborative studies for continuous reuse. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Brain aging is a global health concern and a major focus of dozens of large scale research initiatives around the world. Here, we propose a paradigm to use advanced brain imaging techniques in a harmonized fashion across numerous existing datasets, and to map the underlying genetic influences driving neurodegeneration across tens of thousands of individuals. We will provide advanced brain image processing, mathematical tools, and a portal for researchers to access and add to findings.",High resolution mapping of the genetic risk for disease in the aging brain,9750590,R01AG059874,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Psychiatry', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'International', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Sex Differences', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'Visualization software', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'aging brain', 'aging population', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'biobank', 'brain health', 'cognitive testing', 'data sharing', 'demented', 'dementia risk', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome', 'flexibility', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'global health', 'healthy aging', 'image processing', 'imaging genetics', 'insight', 'male', 'men', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'repository', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'sex', 'tool', 'trait', 'trend']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2019,619917,324592664,0.015277478294054198
"Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction Project Summary Substance use disorders (SUDs) are increasing in prevalence and are already a leading cause of disability, due in part to the fact that our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is incomplete. Like most neuropsychiatric syndromes, SUDs are highly heterogeneous, and distinct mechanisms may be operative in some individuals but not in others, even within a single diagnostic category. Furthermore, SUDs frequently co- occur with depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric syndromes, complicating efforts to identify molecular and circuit-level mechanisms, and disentangle them from those involved in mood and anxiety disorders. Diagnostic heterogeneity is thus a fundamental obstacle to developing better treatments, identifying biomarkers for quantifying risk for different forms of addiction, and predicting treatment response and relapse. Recently, we developed and validated an approach to discovering and diagnosing subtypes of depression using fMRI measures of functional connectivity, which in turn predicted subtype-specific clinical symptom profiles and treatment outcomes. Here, in response to PAR-18-062, we propose a secondary data analysis that would extend this approach to SUDs, leveraging multiple deeply characterized and large-scale neuroimaging datasets. Our central hypothesis is that individual differences in mechanisms underlying impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution (iRISA) are mediated by distinct forms of dysfunctional connectivity in addiction-related circuits, which in turn interact and give rise to distinct neurophysiological addiction subtypes. In Aim 1, we will use statistical clustering and machine learning methods to delineate these subtypes and optimize classifiers (fMRI biomarkers) for diagnosing them in individual patients, focusing initially on cocaine addiction. In Aim 2, we will validate these subtype-specific biomarkers by first replicating them in a new dataset and then evaluating their longitudinal stability and predictive utility. In Aim 3, we will test whether subtype-specific circuit mechanisms generalize to mediate iRISA functions in other forms of addiction, and define their interactions with distinct mechanisms mediating anhedonia and anxious arousal in patients with comorbid depression and anxiety. Project Narrative Biomarkers have transformed how physicians care for patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a host of other medical conditions by providing quantitative tools for diagnosing disease processes and individualizing treatment decisions. In contrast, biomarkers for addictions remain relatively elusive. This project will test a new strategy for developing neuroimaging (brain scan) biomarkers for diagnosing novel subtypes of addiction in individual patients and then investigate how dysfunction in specific circuits gives rise to specific addiction- related behaviors and clinical symptoms.",Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction,9840077,R01DA047851,"['Abstinence', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Animal Model', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Habits', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Motivation', 'Negative Reinforcements', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcend', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'animal data', 'anxious', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker validation', 'cocaine use', 'comorbid depression', 'craving', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'drug seeking behavior', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'negative affect', 'negative emotional state', 'network dysfunction', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'reinforcer', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'substance misuse', 'tool']",NIDA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2019,621348,227555357,0.0038953491209004227
"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,9743884,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Women&apos', 's Health Nursing', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'motor symptom', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2019,623653,146629556,0.01768316713774747
"BrainStorm: Highly Extensible Software for Advanced Electrophysiology and MEG/EEG Imaging Project Summary Electrophysiological recordings in humans and animals play an essential role in developing an understanding of the human brain. Signal recording technology spans the entire scale from invasive microelectrode single-unit recordings, through mesoscale macroelectrode measures of local field potentials, to whole-brain monitoring through measurement of scalp potentials (EEG) and extracranial magnetic fields (MEG). Analysis of these data presents a host of challenges, from low level noise removal and artifact rejection to sophisticated spatio-temporal modeling and statistical inference. The multidisciplinary neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform this analysis and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data. This proposal describes our plans to continue to develop and support Brainstorm, open-source software that meets this need. Brainstorm is a Matlab/Java multi-platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows) software package for analysis and visualization of electrophysiological data. The software is extensively documented through a series of detailed tutorials and actively supported through a user forum and a mailing list. Over the past 8 years we have registered 16,000 distinct users, provided hands on instruction to 1,200 trainees, and the software has been used and cited in ~600 journal papers. Brainstorm includes tools for importing MEG/EEG, intracranial EEG, animal electrophysiology, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data from multiple vendors, extensive interactive features for data preprocessing, selection and visualization, coregistration to volume and surface MRIs and atlases, forward and inverse mapping of cortical current density, time-series and connectivity analysis, and a range of statistical tools. Data can be analyzed through a graphical interface or through scripted pipelines. The current proposal represents a plan to extend Brainstorm in a manner that leverages the unique features of our software and addresses important needs for large-scale data analysis. In this project we will continue to extend and support our software through the following three specific aims: (i) we will harness recent developments in distributed and shared data and high performance computing resources, together with standardization of data organization, to facilitate large-scale, reproducible analysis of electrophysiological data. (ii) We will also address the need for improved modeling resulting from the increasing use of both invasive recordings and direct brain stimulation through development of new modeling software for accurate computation of the intracranial electromagnetic fields produced by brain stimulation and neuronal activation. (iii) Finally, we will continue to add new functionality and to support the software through in-person training, online forums, documentation and other resources. Project Narrative Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) are absolutely non-invasive brain imaging tools, which provide information on the spatial distribution and precise temporal orchestration of human brain activity. In addition to basic neuroscience research, MEG and EEG can be also used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. The neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform these analyses and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data.

"Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification Project Abstract Motivation: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 500 million people. Children commonly develop CKD from urinary obstructive diseases and nephrotoxic therapies, and then suffer severe growth failure,  hypertension, cardiovascular risks, and neurocognitive deficits, and eventually end-stage kidney disease. Accurate renal function quantification will improve clinical management of hydronephrosis (1 in 100 babies) and  dosing/selection of chemotherapeutic regimens in oncology patients. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the biomarker of renal function, is derived from blood or urine tests. These tests only provide global GFR and are limited in accuracy, especially in children, and even more so in children with cancer. MRI offers superb anatomic delineation without ionizing radiation, and is thus ideal for pediatric kidney imaging. However, MRI has not been widely adopted for pediatric renal function evaluation due to lack of reliability and cumbersome workflow. These hurdles stem from the fact that the critical components required for global and regional GFR calculation, including high spatiotemporal resolution, plasma flow and arterial input function, are difficult to obtain, and that accurate image segmentation of kidneys (cortex and medulla) is labor intensive. Additionally, although the same contrast agent injection can be used for obstruction evaluation, certain areas of the kidney suffer from significant signal loss using standard MRI acquisition techniques due to high contrast agent concentrations. This project addresses these major challenges for automated comprehensive renal function evaluation in children. Approach: The project has three development aims, which are validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable novel free-breathing time-resolved 3D dynamic contrast enhanced MRI that simultaneously provides accurate GFR calculation and renal plasma flow. This is achieved by incorporating self-navigated motion compensation, fast acquisition with parallel imaging and compressed sensing, and phase-contrast flow imaging. The second aim is to develop multiple new image analysis methods to extract GFR and renal plasma flow (RPF) that  leverage novel flow data of Aim 1, as well as automated new machine-learning image processing techniques for the segmentation of kidneys and ultimately global and regional GFR calculation. In Aim 3, we will develop and integrate ultrashort-echo-time techniques to address the MRI signal loss due to T2* effects from high contrast concentration for patients with obstruction, and further incorporate motion compensation and accelerated  imaging methods to enable time-resolved high-resolution dynamic MRI for contrast washout kinetics analysis in the same MR exam. Aim 4 will determine the performance of these methods in a clinical setting. Significance: This work will lead to robust, automated comprehensive pediatric renal MRI for safer and more accurate renal function evaluation in children. The techniques will facilitate widespread application in the com- munity setting and permit robust evaluation of renal function, for both children and adults. Project Narrative Kidney diseases in children often stem from blockages of the urinary tract or toxicity from medications, such as antibiotics or chemotherapies. Kidney function quantification is crucial for clinical management of these children. This work will develop accurate and automated pediatric MRI for quantification of kidney function and diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction.",Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification,9677647,R01EB026136,"['3-Dimensional', '4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac Output', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Cone', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Hydronephrosis', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Obstruction', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Reflux', 'Regimen', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Renal Plasma Flow', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Urinary tract', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Venous', 'Work', 'antimicrobial drug', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'community setting', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast enhanced', 'data acquisition', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'kidney cortex', 'kidney imaging', 'loss of function', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'pressure', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem', 'urinary', 'urinary tract obstruction', 'urologic']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,665614,560644462,-0.005843370401615708
"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burden of human disability.",Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia,9653114,R01DC011805,"['Affect', 'Biological Markers', 'Botulinum Toxins', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communication', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dystonia', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family history of', 'Focal Dystonias', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal muscle structure', 'Larynx', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Occupational', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social isolation', 'Spasm', 'Spastic Dysphonias', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'disability', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'side effect', 'standard care', 'symptom management', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2019,696730,32639530,-0.013992010684703907
"In-vivo MRI-based prediction of TDP43 pathology in aging ABSTRACT Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology, a primary protein abnormality in the rare diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, is now recognized as a common age-related neuropathology, detected at autopsy in approximately 50% of older persons. According to recent evidence, TDP43 pathology in aging is associated with more rapid cognitive decline and higher odds of dementia, above and beyond contributions from Alzheimer’s and other age-related neuropathologies. In spite of its high frequency and deleterious effects, TDP43 can only be diagnosed at autopsy, and there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging. The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging by combining multimodal MRI and pathology in the same older persons from large community cohorts. Specifically, we propose to a) train TDP43 classifiers using machine learning based on ex- vivo MRI measurements of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical brain characteristics of older persons, b) translate these classifiers in-vivo, and c) test them in-vivo using longitudinal clinical, in-vivo MRI, and pathology data on older adults enrolled without dementia. We have generated a unique ex-vivo and in-vivo multimodal MRI-pathology database within the infrastructure of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG17917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), two longitudinal, epidemiologic clinical- pathologic cohort studies of aging that recruit non-demented individuals and have high follow-up rates and high autopsy rates. Using our database, we have produced compelling preliminary results in support of our aims. First, we have demonstrated that ex-vivo brain MRI data can be linked to in-vivo MRI data. Second, we show that TDP43 pathology is related to specific brain MRI characteristics independent of other age-related pathologies. Third, we show high TDP43 classification performance (AUC=0.81) based on ex-vivo MRI features in persons with as well as without comorbid Alzheimer’s pathology (a common coexisting pathology). Fourth, we demonstrate that the confidence score obtained from ex-vivo MRI classification is linked to the progression of deposition of TDP43 pathology (i.e. TDP43 stages). Finally, we translated a preliminary ex-vivo TDP43 classifier for use in-vivo and demonstrated in a small sample that it has high in-vivo classification performance, and is independently associated with lower cognition. We propose to further develop and test this promising in-vivo MRI classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology is now recognized as a common and deleterious age-related neuropathology, however, there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging, and diagnosis is only possible at autopsy. The objective of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in older community- dwelling persons with and without dementia, based on a combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical characteristics of the brain. Successful completion of the proposed work will have broad immediate implications in refining participant selection in clinical trials, as well as long term implications in the advancement of translational research and targeted disease-specific therapeutic approaches.",In-vivo MRI-based prediction of TDP43 pathology in aging,9802664,R01AG064233,"['Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Autopsy', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Religion and Spirituality', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'base', 'cohort', 'follow-up', 'frontotemporal lobar dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'in vivo', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'non-demented', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'recruit', 'response']",NIA,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,708822,8894636,-0.013873572748319534
"Reproducible imaging-based brain growth charts for psychiatry ABSTRACT Major psychiatric illnesses are increasingly understood as disorders of brain development, which has led to large-scale studies of youth that combine multi-modal neuroimaging with clinical phenotyping. Together, such data have emphasized the promise of objective ‘growth charts’ of brain development. However, synergies across major efforts remains unrealized due to use of different clinical instruments, different scanning protocols, challenges in informatics, and difficulties in data integration. In this proposal, we will overcome these obstacles by leveraging advances in multivariate harmonization and analysis techniques to build highly reproducible growth charts of human brain development. To do this, we will aggregate and harmonize eight existing large-scale developmental imaging studies, comprising over 10,000 participants between the age of 5- 24 (Aim 1). We will use this harmonized data to build generalizable indices of normal network brain development (Aim 2). Finally, developmental abnormalities within specific brain networks will be linked to dimensions of psychopathology (Aim 3). Critically, all code, data, and derived indices will be shared publicly, creating a massive new resource to accelerate research in the developmental neuroscience community (Aim 4). In sum, this proposal will have provide a new data resource, yield reproducible growth charts of brain development, and delineate novel mechanisms regarding the developmental basis of psychopathology in youth. RELEVANCE Psychiatric illnesses often begin in childhood, adolescence, or young adulthood, and are increasingly conceptualized as disorders of brain development. Reproducible growth charts of bran development are critical for understanding both normal brain development and abnormalities associated with diverse psychopathology. Early interventions crafted using these growth charts would benefit the public health by reducing the huge disability associated with psychiatric disorders and limiting the costs to society at large.",Reproducible imaging-based brain growth charts for psychiatry,9810689,R01MH120482,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Age', 'Base of the Brain', 'Bayesian Method', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Early Intervention', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Grain', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Properdin', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'aging brain', 'anxious', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data archive', 'data integration', 'data resource', 'design', 'disability', 'externalizing behavior', 'image processing', 'imaging study', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'learning strategy', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'portability', 'quality assurance', 'response', 'segregation', 'serial imaging', 'sex', 'somatosensory', 'synergism', 'theories', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,780855,593605914,-0.006013858338031528
"Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders Project Summary/Abstract  Disorders of mood and psychosis such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar depression are  incredibly complex, influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, and the clinical characterizations are primarily based on symptoms rather than biological information. Current diagnostic approaches are based on symptoms, which overlap extensively in some cases, and there is growing consensus that we should approach mental illness as a continuum, rather than as a categorical entity. Since both genetic and environmental factors play a large role in mental illness, the combination of brain imaging and genomic data are poised to play an important role is clarifying our understanding of mental illness. However, both imaging and genomic data are high dimensional and include complex relationships that are poorly understood. To characterize the available information, we are in need of approaches that can deal with high-dimensional data exhibiting interactions at multiple levels (i.e., data fusion), while providing interpretable solutions (i.e., a focus on brain and genomic  networks). An additional challenge exists because the available data has mixed temporal dimensionality, e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do not change over time, brain structure changes slowly over time, while fMRI changes rapidly over time. To address these challenges, we introduce a new unified framework called flexible subspace analysis (FSA) that can automatically identify subspaces (groupings of unimodal or multimodal  components) in joint multimodal data. Our approach leverages the interpretability of source separation approaches and can include additional flexibility by allowing for a combination of shallow and ‘deep’ subspaces, thus  leveraging the power of deep learning. We will apply the developed models to a large (N>60,000) dataset of  individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum to evaluate the important question of disease categorization. We will compute fully cross-validated genomic-neuro-behavioral profiles of individuals including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of 1) standard categories from the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM), 2) data-driven subgroups, and 3) dimensional relationships. We will also evaluate the single subject predictive power of these profiles in independent data to maximize generalization. All methods and results will be shared with the community. The combination of advanced algorithmic approach plus the large N data  promises to advance our understanding of the nosology of mood and psychosis disorders in addition to providing new tools that can be widely applied to other studies of complex disease. Project Narrative  It is clear that mood and psychosis disorders, largely diagnosed without biological criteria, include a multitude of inter-related genetic and environmental factors. We propose to develop new flexible models to capture  multiscale (dynamic) brain imaging and genomics data, which we will use to study individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum using a large aggregated dataset including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of two dichotomous approaches (standard diagnostic categories and unsupervised/data-driven) as well as a  dimensional approach to diagnosis.",Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders,9935464,R01MH118695,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Property', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Work', 'base', 'bipolar patients', 'blind', 'connectome', 'data anonymization', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'flexibility', 'genomic data', 'independent component analysis', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'profiles in patients', 'psychotic symptoms', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,823331,43632870,0.0063605906694138925
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9692060,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit', 'response', 'reward processing', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2019,857083,68331629,0.013658969907760079
"Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disrupted circadian timing has emerged as a serious health and safety issue, yet there are no objective means of easily assessing circadian timing or alignment without performing a highly controlled, multiple-day in- patient study. Altered circadian timing can cause both sleep loss and sleepiness, cause performance errors such as motor vehicle accidents, and impair memory/learning. Thus, despite the obvious need to recognize an individual's circadian phase/alignment, we cannot assess circadian timing clinically or in retrospective studies. Not surprisingly, the first goal of the 2011 NIH Sleep Disorders Research Plan is to identify: ""...metabolic... biomarkers of sleep deficiency and biological timing...and circadian disorders that will facilitate personalized treatments, and clarify the risk associated with untreated sleep and circadian disorders and disturbances."" We are aware that major challenges face biomarker development, including multi-factorial causes of metabolite shifts normally controlled across multiple time-points. Because circadian time is associated with profound metabolic, immune and cardiovascular changes, however, we hypothesize that a biomarker signature for circadian phase derived from -omic markers can be obtained from a single blood sample. We therefore propose to utilize the analytical and bioinformatics platforms and experience in population-level metabolomics studies in the PIs lab to study banked plasma samples from the well-characterized individuals in six tightly controlled circadian rhythm studies run by the four co-investigators.The Aims are:  Aim 1: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and t cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics-  based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples drawn from three constant routine protocols Aim 2: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and to cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples  drawn from four forced desynchrony protocols  Aim 3: To systematically evaluate the validated profiles from Aims 1 and 2 and their mathematical  similarities and differences so as to improve accuracy and precision of the biomarkers  Aim 4: To test the markers identified above under poorly controlled real world applications Identification of biomarker panels will impact multiple aspects of science and health: (i) contribute to clinical recognition and treatment on circadian disorders; (ii) advance personalized medicine through individualized treatment timing to enhance efficacy/reduce side effects of medications (e.g., chemotherapy); (iii) creating epidemiologic tools to relate circadian with disease risk; and aiding development of other disease biomarkers, and; (iv) contribute to research on circadian biology and its implications for human health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to identify blood-based markers that can inform a clinician or researcher about an individual's internal biological clock. At the broad levels of society and public health research, the work has the potential direct benefit of identifying individuals with ""off-set"" clocks (enabling diagnosis and potential therapy), increasing accuracy and precision of studies of blood lipids, facilitating understanding of certain sleep disorders, increasing understanding of the role of biological clocks in chronic disease processes (e.g., cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease), and potentially improving the administration of certain pharmaceuticals, eg, chemotherapy agents.","Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting",9666966,R01HL132556,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Clocks', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Disease', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Drowsiness', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Memory impairment', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Strigiformes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker identification', 'biomarker panel', 'blood lipid', 'blood-based biomarker', 'chemotherapy', 'circadian', 'combinatorial', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'human population study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'men', 'metabolomics', 'personalized medicine', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'real world application', 'side effect', 'tool', 'vehicular accident']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,862336,327644200,0.007310376192513312
"Neural substrates of diffusion imaging in cognitively aging rhesus monkeys 7. Abstract.  The ability to identify and follow-up neurobiological changes that occur during brain maturation and aging is not only fundamental to our understanding of cognition, but is also crucial for clinical studies that focus on either neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders, including clinical trials. While post-mortem studies provide data that are well characterized in terms of localized histological changes, these data can be limited due to their cross sectional nature and small samples sizes. In contrast, non-invasive in vivo imaging allows for the collection of longitudinal data in much larger populations, and is a more powerful tool to investigate life span trajectories of brain maturation and aging. Recent developments in neuroimaging have provided evidence for the relationship between imaging changes and cognitive aging in monkeys, and humans. Unfortunately, the cellular underpinnings of cognitive age are a subject of debate and hence the biological specificity of available imaging measures is not well established. More alarming, while older imaging measures still lack thorough validation, newer “more specific” measures that are being constantly introduced into clinical research are even further from validation. Over the past funding period, we have worked with a large repository of histological, cognitive and imaging legacy data from cognitively aging rhesus monkeys, testing the hypothesis that neuroinflammation and myelin degeneration play crucial roles in cognitive aging, and that neuroimaging biomarkers can reflect those biological processes. We propose to further our work in this direction, by proposing translational experiments that will include 1). acquiring new, high resolution “Human Connectome Project (HCP)” compatible imaging data, 2). Expand our neuroimaging by adding neuroinflammation- and myelin-specific PET radioligands, 3). Develop neuroimaging white matter-specific biomarkers of mild cognitive impairment- a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, and 4). Investigate biological underpinnings of sex differences in aging. This is enabled by a collaboration of three PIs, with unique and complementary expertise in MRI imaging, morphometry, neuroanatomy, immunohistochemistry and cognitive aging, and will be further facilitated by acquiring and analyzing behavioral, imaging, blood and post mortem data from a cohort of 24 rhesus monkeys of both sexes, 8 young adults (4 males and 4 females) and 16 old adults (8 males and 8 females, half diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)). The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system. 8. Project Narrative. The three PIs and their co-investigators propose a multidisciplinary study of cognitive aging in rhesus monkeys. We plan to acquire new, state of the art imaging data, and combine it with cognitive assessments, blood measures, and postmortem brain tissue to explore the biological underpinnings and establish the specificity of the imaging biomarkers to neurobiology of cognitive aging. The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many other clinical populations including neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases of central nervous system.",Neural substrates of diffusion imaging in cognitively aging rhesus monkeys,9817776,R01AG042512,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Anisotropy', 'Astrocytes', 'Autopsy', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cell Aging', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Female', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammation', 'Ligands', 'Longevity', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Monkeys', 'Myelin', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuroglia', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radio', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Specificity', 'Spin Labels', 'Stains', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Water', 'Work', 'age related', 'brain tissue', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'data acquisition', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'juvenile animal', 'male', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'morphometry', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodal data', 'myelin degeneration', 'myelination', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuroinflammation', 'radioligand', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'response', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter change', 'young adult']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,891796,327644200,-0.006744081530653596
"BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR) To take advantage of recent and ongoing advances in intensive and large-scale computational methods, and to preserve the scientific data created by publicly funded research projects, data archives must be created as well as standards for specifying, identifying, and annotating deposited data. The value of and interest in such archives among researchers can be greatly increased by adding to them an active computational capability and framework of analysis and search tools that support further analysis as well as larger scale meta-analysis and large scale data mining. The OpenNeuro.org archive, begun as a repository for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, is such an archive. We propose to build a gateway to OpenNeuro for human electrophysiology data (EEG and MEG, as well as intracranial data recorded from clinical patients to plan brain surgeries or other therapies) – herein we refer to these modalities as neuroelectromagnetic (NEM) data. The Neuroelectromagnetic Data Archive and Tools Resource (NEMAR) at the San Diego Supercomputer Center will act as a gateway to OpenNeuro for NEM data research. Such data uploaded to NEMAR at SDSC will be deposited in the OpenNeuro archive. Still- private NEM data in OpenNeuro will, on user request, be copied to the NEMAR gateway for further user processing using the XSEDE high-performance resources at SDSC in conjunction with The Neuroscience Gateway (nsgportal.org), a freely available and easy to use portal to use of high-performance computing resources for neuroscience research. Publicly available OpenNeuro NEM data will be able to be analyzed by running verified analysis applications on the OpenNeuro system. In this project we will build an application to evaluate the quality of uploaded NEM data, and another to visualize the data, for EEG and MEG at both the scalp and brain source levels, including time-domain and frequency-domain dynamics time locked to sets of experimental events learned from the BIDS- and HED-formatted data annotations. The NEMAR gateway will take a major step toward applying machine learning methods to a large store of carefully collected and stored human electrophysiologic brain data to spur new developments in basic and clinical brain research. The NEMAR gateway to the OpenNeuro.org human neuroimaging data archive will build tools to add human electrical and magnetic brain activity records to the archive, to evaluate its quality for users and visualize its features. The resulting facility will allow applications of new machine learning methods to research on human brain dynamics that can be expected to lead to breakthroughs in understanding how the human brain supports our awareness and behavior in both health and disease.",BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR),9795341,R24MH120037,"['Archives', 'Awareness', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Deposition', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetism', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scalp structure', 'Science', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spottings', 'Staging', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'brain research', 'brain surgery', 'built environment', 'computational platform', 'computerized data processing', 'computing resources', 'cyber infrastructure', 'data archive', 'data format', 'data mining', 'data structure', 'data submission', 'hackathon', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'preservation', 'repository', 'response', 'sensor', 'supercomputer', 'support tools', 'tool', 'tool development', 'web interface', 'web services', 'web site']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R24,2019,926107,524978793,0.02772148709170056
"Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD Overall Summary The overarching goal of the proposed center is to leverage molecular and circuit biomarkers to advance the understanding of mechanisms and personalized treatment of topiramate treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder comorbid with PTSD. We propose an integrative translational focus on alterations in excitatory and inhibitory signaling, focusing on GABA and glutamate and related circuitry, to model the neurobiology of PTSD comorbid with PTSD and the mitigating effects of topiramate. We will characterize excitatory and inhibitory molecular markers in an animal model of AUD comorbid with PTSD, utilizing genomic markers in the brain and plasma markers in rodents. In clinical trial participants we will characterize excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signaling by ascertaining plasma markers, GRIK 1 genotype and neural circuit markers utilizing TMS evoked potentials in EEG, task-based functional MRI and MR spectroscopy. This goal will be achieved through the activities of three research projects supported by two research cores, the administrative core and the Scientific Advisory Board (Figure1). In Project 1 lead by Silvia Fossati Ph.D. and Jorge Manzanares Robles Ph.D. we will study the behavioral and molecular effects of two doses of topiramate vs. vehicle in animal models of AUD alone, PTSD alone and AUD+PTSD. In Project 2 lead by Michael Bogenschutz M.D. and Joshua Lee M.D. we will study the behavioral, genetic and plasma biomarker effects of topiramate vs. placebo in 150 participants with co-occurring AUD and PTSD. In project 3 lead by Amit Etkin M.D., Ph.D. and Charles R. Marmar M.D. we will ascertain multi-modal imaging markers including task based fMRI, TMS evoked potentials in EEG and MRS. Imaging markers will be used to characterize excitatory and inhibitory circuits in Project 2 clinical trial participants with AUD+PTSD to determine predictors and mechanisms of topiramate vs. placebo treatment outcomes. Plasma biomarkers in Project 2 will be related to the same or homologous plasma biomarkers in Project 1. Circuit markers from Project 3 will be related to genomic markers in the same or homologous brain regions in Project 1. The Biofluids Biomarker Core (BBC) lead by Dr. Fossati will support collection of plasma biomarkers (GABA, glutamate, HPA axis, neuropeptides, neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress) in animals in Project 1 and clinical trial participants in Project 2. The Analytics and Biostatistics Core (ABC) lead by Eugene Laska Ph.D. and Carole Segal Ph.D. will support experimental design, formulation of hypothesis, power calculations, and data integrity, management and analysis for Project 1, 2 and 3, implementing advanced statistical models for individualized prediction of response to topiramate in Project 1 and Project 2. Overall Narrative We aim to advance personalized topiramate treatment for comorbid AUD and PTSD by focusing on network excitatory and inhibitory imbalances underlying heightened negative emotions and impairments in executive function and emotion regulation. Excitatory and inhibitory targets will be assessed with brain, plasma and circuit markers, where possible harmonizing the approach for optimizing discovery of mechanisms and prediction of topiramate treatment in animal models and in clinical trial participants.

"Epidemiologic Study of Neural Reserve and Neurobiology of Aging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Extensive progress was made in the previous funding period of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). We 1) elucidated the neuropathologic basis of cognitive decline due to Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD), 2) discovered genomic, experiential, psychological, and medical risk factors for ADRD clinical and pathologic traits including numerous risk factors for Alzheimer’s dementia with little to no relationship with ADRD brain pathologies, and 3) identified numerous potential novel therapeutic targets for cognitive decline, especially targets for cognitive decline not explained by common brain pathologies i.e., resilience. Here, the average person has average resilience and individuals can be more or less resilient. Resilience is a high value therapeutic target because if druggable it would offset the effects of any combination of brain pathologies. In this funding cycle, we propose to continue to follow MAP participants and conduct autopsies, and in this cycle, to obtain skin biopsies at autopsy to support a powerful new drug discovery program that integrates existing brain omics data with a new human cellular model of disease, i.e., skin derived fibroblast cultures induced into neuronal lines from persons with more or less resilience. We propose to: 1) define a robust and specific molecular signature of resilience in the human brain; 2) identify gene targets of resilience and establish human low-resilience cell models derived from MAP participants of known resilience; and 3) conduct drug discovery screens in the low-resilience models to identify compounds that increase resilience. These aims are supported by compelling preliminary work. An Exploratory Aim will continue to identify risk factors for ADRD clinical and pathologic traits leveraging the rich resource generated from the exposure data, repeated measures, and neuropathologic traits . All aims will examine sex as a biologic variable. A Secondary Aim will continue to share the unique and valuable resources generated by MAP including the to-be-generated fibroblast cell lines with the scientific community. Harnessing mechanisms of resilience to ADRD can slow down or prevent cognitive decline regardless of the presence and complexity of common brain pathologies. Therefore, the genes and compounds identified from our study will provide new therapeutic remedies to boost brain reserve in combating ADRD-related dementia. We believe that the proposed continuation will have a high and sustained impact on the field of aging and dementia research. POJECT NARRATIVE/PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The identification of novel therapeutics to prevent of cognitive decline, MCI and Alzheimer’s dementia is a major public health priority. Resilience is a high value therapeutic target with the potential to maintain cognition regardless of the type and number of brain pathologies. The proposed continuation of MAP will identify genes and compounds that affect a molecular signature of resilience in a novel human cell model of disease from autopsied MAP partic ipants .",Epidemiologic Study of Neural Reserve and Neurobiology of Aging,9917201,R01AG017917,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Autopsy', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Screening', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts', 'Funding', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Persons', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Skin', 'Source', 'Work', 'apolipoprotein E-3', 'base', 'combat', 'drug discovery', 'epidemiology study', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'human model', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'neuropathology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'sex', 'therapeutic target', 'trait']",NIA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,2825827,55098220,-0.02116096996860138
"Aging eyes and aging brains in studying alzheimer's disease: Modern ophthalmic data collection in the adult changes in thought (ACT) study PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT The overarching goals of this R01 proposal are to improve scientific understanding of potential mechanisms by which ophthalmic diseases lead to the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. The investigators will leverage modern ophthalmic data with state-of-the-art imaging and extensive archived clinical data from a well-characterized cohort of older adults. The investigators propose to examine the effect of structural and functional changes in retina and longitudinal severity of ophthalmic diseases on Alzheimer’s disease and related neuropathology. The proposal builds on the resources of the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study, a prospective longitudinal, population-based, dementia-free cohort of over 5,500 people to date established in 1994 which has detected >1,014 research quality diagnoses of Alzheimer’s disease and >1,254 dementia to date. ACT follows consenting participants to autopsy and has performed state-of-the arts autopsy on >781 decedents to date. In this extremely well-characterized cohort, the investigators found that several ophthalmic diseases (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration) are significantly associated with the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. The investigators will use three advanced ophthalmic imaging modalities at both home and clinical research study visits: fundus photography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and OCT angiography (OCTA), to obtain quantitative data relevant to these ophthalmic diseases. The study team will establish the distribution (Aim 1a) and 2- and 4-year evolution of ophthalmic imaging characteristics found in older adults in the community and determine associations with change in cognition (Aim 1 b, c). Additionally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI angiography (MRA) will be obtained in a subset of participants to investigate the contribution of small (retinal) and large (cerebral) vascular disease towards cognitive changes (Aim 1d). The study team will continue ACT study’s strong commitment for meaningful data sharing. In collaboration with the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging at University of Southern California, the study team will promulgate these ophthalmic data in addition to neuroimaging data to the research community (Aim 1e). In Aim 2, the investigators will use extensive clinical ophthalmology data captured over many decades and incorporate them in novel longitudinal models of eye disease severity. The investigators will analyze eye disease severity along with extensive neuropathology data from the ACT study, including both standard (Aim 2a) and novel quantitative (Aim 2b) neuropathology data, to further scientific understanding of neuropathological mechanisms underlying associations between eye conditions and Alzheimer’s disease risk. The brain is not amenable to direct observations during life. In contrast, the eye is an anterior extension of the central nervous system and may provide a valuable window to illuminate neurodegenerative processes in the aging brain. Proposed investigations will substantially enhance scientific understanding of the role of modern ophthalmic evaluations in delineating risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of neuropathology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Using a large, well-characterized, longitudinal, prospective, cohort study, the study team previously found that diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration were significantly associated with Alzheimer’s disease risk. The team proposes to use three cutting edge ophthalmic imaging modalities to obtain quantitative data at both home and clinic research study visits in addition to MRI and MRA in a subset of participants to evaluate their associations with change in cognition over time (Aim 1). The team will leverage extensive ophthalmic clinical and neuropathological data already available for 781 study participants to date as well as new state-of-the-art quantitative measures of beta amyloid (A1-42) and phosphorylated tau to elucidate mechanisms underlying associations between ophthalmic conditions and Alzheimer’s disease (Aim 2).",Aging eyes and aging brains in studying alzheimer's disease: Modern ophthalmic data collection in the adult changes in thought (ACT) study,9816310,R01AG060942,"['Abbreviations', 'Adult', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Angiography', 'Anterior', 'Archives', 'Autopsy', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drusen', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Fundus photography', 'Ganglion Cell Layer', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neuraxis', 'Occipital lobe', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Selection Bias', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'aging brain', 'area striata', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis quality', 'epidemiology study', 'fiber cell', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'paired helical filament', 'population based', 'prospective', 'repository', 'research study', 'resilience', 'spelling', 'tau Proteins', 'tau-1', 'vascular contributions']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,3869686,533302350,-0.057357419912189504
"Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by  Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging can provide safe, non-invasive, and whole-brain measurements for large clinical and research studies of brain disorders. However, many disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alterations, which are often difficult to tease out due to limited image quality afforded by the popular 3T MRI scanners (with 20,000+ units available worldwide). Although 7T MRI scanners provide better image quality, these ultrahigh field scanners are not widely available (with only 40+ units available worldwide) and are also not used clinically. Thus, tools for reconstructing 7T-like high-quality MRI from 3T MRI scan are highly desirable. A means for achieving this is by learning the relationship between 3T and 7T MRI scans from training samples. This renewal project is dedicated to developing a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels of 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD. Specifically, (Aim 1) to enhance the image quality of 3T MRI, we will develop a novel deep learning architecture to learn a complex multi-layer 3T-to-7T mapping from training subjects, each with coupled 3T and 7T MRI scans. This mapping will then be applied to reconstruct quality-enhanced 7T-like MRI scans from new 3T MRI scans. (Aim 2) For brain structural measurement (e.g., brain atrophies, and hippocampal volume shrinkage), a crucial step is brain tissue segmentation. We will thus develop a robust and accurate random forest tissue segmentation method, which maps 7T label information to 3T scans. The mapping function is trained using tissue labels generated for 7T scans, instead of 3T scans which often have limited image contrast. (Aim 3) To further quantify local atrophies in ROIs or even sub-ROIs (i.e., hippocampal subfields), we will develop a deformable multi-ROI segmentation method by employing (a) random forest to predict deformation from each image location to the target boundary by adaptive integration of multimodal (anatomical, structural & functional connectivity) information and (b) auto-context model to iteratively refine ROI segmentation results. Note that the adaptive integration of multimodal MRI data, especially resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), is critical to the segmentation of sub-ROIs such as hippocampal subfields, since local functional connectivity patterns can help distinguish boundaries between neighboring subfields that often have different cortico-cortical connections. (Aim 4) Finally, by integrating anatomical features from all accurately segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs and also structural & functional connectivity features between those segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs, we can more effectively detect early-stage brain disorders, i.e., the conversion of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD. We will integrate information from different imaging datasets and multiple imaging centers by using our novel multi-task learning approach for jointly learning the respective disease prediction models. Applications. These computational methods will find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormalities associated with various neurological diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia), measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between imaging and clinical scores. Narrative Description of Project The goal of this renewal project is to achieve robust brain measurements from the routine 3T MRI, guided by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI. To this end, we will create a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels from 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new testing subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD.",Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI,9548265,R01EB006733,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Atrophic', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain tissue', 'cerebral atrophy', 'contrast imaging', 'deep learning', 'disease diagnosis', 'forest', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'research study', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,1,511185245,-0.007038311952502387
"2018 Neurobiology of Cognition Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar SUMMARY This proposal requests partial support for the fifth Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on the Neurobiology of Cognition, and for its associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) for trainees. The driving force behind the GRC is the rapid pace of convergent findings in molecular, cellular circuit and systems Neuroscience, augmented by technical developments in cell-targeting, imaging, computing and brain-machine interfaces. As a result, there are rapidly evolving descriptions of neuronal circuits and dynamics, neurophysiological processes and computational principles that underpin cognitive functions. The overarching goal of this GRC is to promote communication and collaboration across relevant levels of analysis and among empirical scientists, theoreticians and technical development specialists, emphasizing the most recent findings. The associated GRS, held just prior to the GRC, is designed to provide opportunities for doctoral and post-doctoral trainees to communicate their most recent findings and perspectives, and to prepare them for more in-depth participation in the parent GRC that immediately follows. Along with recent findings in traditional “core” areas such as memory and decision making, formal sessions will explore several new themes, including: 1) the evolutionary processes that have led to the human brain's cognitive abilities and 2) machine learning and its implications for cognitive neuroscience, 3) cognition in natural contexts 4) processing of sound for language, and 5) the brain as a network of interconnected areas. The program is highly interdisciplinary, bringing together behavioral, neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques in humans and non-human animals with computational approaches that explicate empirical findings and construct realistic models to represent the developing picture of cognitive operations and guide future experimentation. The program also underscores novel, state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical approaches that promise to define fundamental principles of cognition, and to extend these to improved treatment of brain dysfunction. The format of the meeting promotes intensive interactions among investigators and trainees from different perspectives and analytic levels, and in particular, between experimentalists and theorists. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this conference is to promote communication and collaboration among empirical scientists and theoreticians working in the field of cognitive neuroscience with the focus on the improved understanding of the biological basis of language, perception, memory, social cognition and decision-making. Insights into the neural basis of these fundamental cognitive processes, will lead to improved diagnoses and treatment of many cognitive disorders with profound implications for society, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and autism.",2018 Neurobiology of Cognition Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar,9541371,R13NS106864,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evolution', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Techniques', 'To specify', 'brain dysfunction', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'cell type', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive task', 'design', 'driving force', 'genetic manipulation', 'improved', 'insight', 'language perception', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'operation', 'peer', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'social cognition', 'sound', 'symposium', 'targeted imaging']",NINDS,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2018,5000,740405,0.0033358919635682075
"Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior Project Summary / Abstract High-throughput experimental neuroscience has made it possible to observe behavior of many animals, as well as a large groups of neurons simultaneously, providing an exciting opportunity for figuring out how the neural system performs computations that underlie perception, cognition, and behavior. However, there is a major bottleneck in the scientific cycle of data analysis and data collection due to the complexity and scale of noisy, high-dimensional data. The primary objective of this project is to develop tools for tracking the internal state of the brain that are not directly measurable from both the behavior and neural signals, and to generate optimal stimulus corresponding to the current brain state. These external stimuli can be used to perturb the animal’s belief or strategy about the world such that the animal would behave differently. Aim 1: Our team will develop a neural state tracking system that will parse out and display complex neural signals recorded from the animal brain in real-time. The neural state tracking algorithm will also extract the law that the neural system operates under, allowing neuroscientist to generate a new class of hypotheses about the population level implementation underlying intelligent behavior. Aim 2: To causally test hypothesis on how population of neurons compute and produce meaningful behavior, it is necessary to be able to perturb the internal computation process. We will develop a feedback control system to perturb the neural dynamics at a short time scale with a novel control scheme for neural computation that respects the brain’s own degrees of freedom. Aim 3: By understanding and tracking the time evolution of internal strategy throughout learning, we can learn how to optimize the training of animal behavior. In this aim, we will develop statistical models of learning and a computational system to generate the best stimuli based on the past performance of the animal. The statistical tools developed in this project will likely accelerate fundamental discoveries in neuroscience. Clinically, this research can extend to monitoring, diagnosing, and building next- generation real-time feedback stimulation devices for disorders with a neurodynamic or behavioral component such as Parkinson’s disease, autism, learning disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, and epilepsy. We will develop new tools to train animals faster for further experiments, and to understand inner  workings of animal brains.

"Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  This revised NIH Individual Fellowship Award (F30) proposal seeks to develop career-specific skills and knowledge of the behavioral contributions and underlying neural mechanisms associated with co-occurring drug use disorder (DUD) and other psychiatric illnesses. The diagnosis of DUD comorbidity is well established clinically, and is prone to more difficult and expensive treatment plans and worse treatment outcomes than either diagnosis alone. Despite the prevalence and clinical significance of DUD comorbidity, few studies have characterized the interactions between environment, behavior, and neural organizations that contribute to DUD comorbidity illness trajectories. Cognitions related to self-beliefs and self-directed behaviors are compromised in individuals with DUD, depression, or PTSD, yet the altered neural circuitry underlying such deficits in comorbid individuals has not been studied. The overall research goal of the proposed project is therefore to identify traits associated with functional neural networks underlying DUD comorbidity and determine how changes in network organization lead to deficits in self-related cognitions in comorbid individuals. Additionally, machine-learning computational models will be trained on Big Data to classify brain-wide patterns of network organization at two distinct stages of DUD comorbidity development. The proposal includes a rigorous training plan for the candidate to gain expertise in neuroimaging methodology and advanced computational approaches to neuroimaging data (e.g., structural equation modeling, machine learning, and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)). An increasingly large data sample (n=550+) of adults and adolescents 12-60 years old will be used to test the aims of this proposal. In Aim 1, controlling for age and sex, environmental variables and self-beliefs will be related to the expression of DUD comorbidity. Using whole-brain mediation analyses, significant traits will then be related to areas of brain activation, with focus on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Aim 2 will use structural equation modeling to test how sex-specific changes in ACC networks are related to self-regulation in individuals with DUD and DUD comorbidity compared to healthy individuals. Aim 3 will use MVPA-derived computational models to classify whole-brain patterns of activity that characterize susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence and sustained comorbidity in adulthood. By classifying brain activity underlying DUD comorbidity at two separate stages of disorder development, this project will help pave the way for future research into more effective treatment methods and better preventative efforts to preclude DUD comorbidity. The career development milestones related to computational psychiatry – clinical medicine, responsible conduct of research, and computational neuroscience – will be attained via this mentored research proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development project seeks to use a Big Data approach to characterize the expression of drug use disorder (DUD) comorbidity. The multilayer project will develop skills and knowledge to support a better understanding of the behaviors and underlying neural mechanisms associated with self-related cognitions in DUD comorbidity. An innovative machine-learning pattern classifier will then be used to identify whole-brain resting-state activation patterns associated with susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence, and sustained comorbidity in adulthood.",Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity,9468973,F30DA043928,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equation', 'Exclusion', 'Fellowship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Perception', 'Self-Direction', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavioral deficiency', 'career', 'career development', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinically significant', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'early life stress', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multilevel analysis', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'responsible research conduct', 'sex', 'skills', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'working group']",NIDA,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,F30,2018,34421,54868437,0.013467278124308963
"Testing the Predictive Power of Structural Neuroimaging in the Estimation of Individuals' Reading and Attentional Abilities PROJECT SUMMARY  Establishing the incremental predictive validity of neuroimaging is a critical prerequisite for this technology's clinical or educational use outside of medical settings. If specific, well-validated neuroimaging tools provide little to no information above that of clinical interview or neuropsychological assessment, the use and funding of those tools should be more critically evaluated against other methods or funding priorities. If neuroimaging demonstrates unique predictive power for assessment or prediction purposes, however, it may aid in the identification of concerning developmental trajectories, the provision of early intervention, or the prediction of individuals' response to specific interventions. Preliminary data from the applicant's laboratory has demonstrated unique contributions of structural neuroimaging to individual differences in reading and attention using confirmatory structural equation modeling, but these questions have yet to be addressed using a data- driven feature-reduction approach that considers numerous types of demographic, behavioral, and brain- derived measures. This proposal focuses explicitly on structural neuroimaging as it is more easily and more consistently obtained than functional imaging in clinical and research environments, and recent findings indicate that it may even be more highly predictive of behavior than functional imaging. In light of these considerations, this proposal will utilize supervised machine learning to assess the incremental validity of structural neuroimaging above and beyond that of traditional psychological assessment.  The goals are this project are to (1) develop and evaluate demographic- and behavior-based predictive models of individuals' reading, inattention, and hyperactivity/impulsivity, (2) replicate and then add neuroanatomical features to these models in order to test structural neuroimaging's incremental predictive validity, and (3) test these models' specificity and discriminant validity for measuring the intended constructs. The long-term goal of this proposal is thus to expand upon the applicant's background in individual difference analyses by developing skills in machine learning so that the incremental validity of multiple neuroimaging modalities can eventually be evaluated. The eventual development of a sufficiently validated predictive model could constitute a behavioral and/or brain-based signature that could serve, along with contextual and functional considerations, as a quantifiable alternative to clinically-based diagnoses. These methods are but first steps toward this distant but worthwhile goal. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Despite decades of studies clarifying the cognitive and neurophysiological predictors of reading and attentional abilities, we're only marginally closer to a more meaningful science of individual prediction. The proposed study will utilize machine learning techniques to test the predictive power of structural neuroimaging above and beyond that of traditional psychological assessment. Beyond the potential for improved prediction of individuals' reading and attentional abilities, the models developed can be easily improved upon using new and preexisting data, thereby moving our field closer to an individualized science of performance- and brain-based markers that can improve early risk identification and evaluate intervention targets.",Testing the Predictive Power of Structural Neuroimaging in the Estimation of Individuals' Reading and Attentional Abilities,9559419,F31HD091967,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Alcohols', 'Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Distant', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neuropsychology', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'demographics', 'falls', 'improved', 'inattention', 'individual response', 'insight', 'mathematical ability', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'phonological awareness', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'processing speed', 'psychologic', 'reading ability', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'tractography']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,F31,2018,36505,492483,-0.0008701398135189864
"Multimodal Neuroimaging Approaches to Modeling Manganese Toxicity Project Summary/Abstract Manganese (Mn) is a known neurotoxin that tens of thousands of workers are exposed to daily, but it is unknown if the current safety guidelines are appropriately strong or too weak to protect them. In an ideal world knowledge of the exposure history of an individual should allow to predict specific risks for health effects. To monitor the effect of Mn welding fumes on workers, the medical imaging techniques Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS) are used to non-invasively image the structure, function, and neurochemistry in the human brain. However, currently studies are not making adequate strides in connecting Mn exposure to changes in MRI or MRS. Studies are only correlating Mn exposure to imaging parameters without taking into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the metal or the individual exposure history, thus lacking the ability to interpret individual data. The broad objective of this project is to fill this crucial gap by creating and validating mathematical models that take into account imaging data, pharmacokinetic properties of Mn and the individual exposure to Mn to predict individual effects of toxicity. Our group runs an ongoing, longitudinal neuroimaging study on local welders and matched controls. Thus we will have abundant and longitudinal data on brain MRI (e.g. T1 maps to assess the brain Mn burden), MRS data on several neurochemicals including GABA, data from personal air sampling and work history questionnaires, neurological and neuropsychological test results, and other biomarkers (toe nails, blood) at our disposal for modeling. The purpose of the current project is to assess and describe how knowledge on exposure and pharmacokinetic properties of Mn enables the interpretation of imaging data as quantitative brain Mn deposition, and how brain-region specific Mn deposition affects neurochemistry in other regions of the brain from where it is deposited. Aim 1 seeks to use MRI structural imaging and known pharmacokinetic properties of Mn to create a mathematical model that can determine the amount of Mn deposition in specific regions of the brain. Aim 2 investigates how the amount, the duration, and the location of Mn deposition in the brain affects neurochemistry. The results of this study will be a first step towards monitoring of individual risks from Mn toxicity by providing the necessary tools to translate exposure information to changes in the brain and consequent health symptoms. Importantly, a better interpretation of individual imaging data will also inform safety guidelines for the individual worker. Project Narrative Manganese (Mn) toxicity leads to disruptive symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease but has no known treatment or cure. Therefore, the prevention, rather than the treatment, of these toxic effects is the first priority for welders, smelters, and other workers exposed to Mn. The goal of this research is to create mathematical models that can predict measureable health consequences from manganese exposure using medical imaging and individual exposure data.",Multimodal Neuroimaging Approaches to Modeling Manganese Toxicity,9494372,F31ES028081,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intoxication', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manganese', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurotoxins', 'Normalcy', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Poison', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Structure of nail of toe', 'Symptoms', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Welding', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'air sampling', 'base', 'cohort', 'exposed human population', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'innovation', 'mathematical model', 'motor impairment', 'multimodality', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'non-invasive imaging', 'outcome prediction', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'screening', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'tool', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,44524,64946317,-0.00026354745626487656

"QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tissue identification and quantification plays a significant role in the study of aging and age-related diseases. For example, the accumulation of fat in the human body and its regional distribution with aging is associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Changes in muscle composition are strongly linked to decline of muscle strength, decreased mobility caused by aging, or musculoskeletal disorders. Especially interesting is analysis of longitudinal changes of morphometric descriptors that is significant for studying the aging process and for the diagnosis and prevention of age-related diseases.  Medical imaging has emerged as a major tool for estimation of body composition mainly due to being non- invasive and producing multi-dimensional information. Nowadays MRI and CT acquisition is a central component of clinical trials. An abundance of imaging data is collected, but this wealth of information has not been utilized to full extent. Therefore research on image analysis techniques for tissue quantification that are reproducible and can be used on large-scale clinical trials is of particular importance.  The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse body composition data from modern MRI and CT imaging. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that qualitative body composition phenotypes on clinical imaging will differentiate individuals who are healthy versus those who are not. The goal of our work is to provide a foundation for image analysis of the abdomen and lower extremities and to study the relationship between body morphological changes and age-related pathologies.  We will build upon recent advances in medical image computing to segment muscle, regional adipose tissue, and bone in clinical CT and MRI scans. We will also develop image registration procedures to achieve intra- and inter-subject correspondence and make efficient use of information provided by multi-modal and multi-temporal imaging data collected in clinical trials (aim 1). After these methods have been developed, we will address the hypothesis that quantitative use of clinical imaging can increase the prognostic accuracy of age-related pathologies (aim2). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age-related diseases such as type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and sarcopenia have become a worldwide epidemic and affect the quality of life of millions. To give a global perspective, roughly 343.8 million people in the world have type-2 diabetes today, and 175 million don't know they have diabetes at all. Metabolic diseases are strongly linked to longitudinal changes in body composition, morphology and function. This project will contribute novel and non-invasive medical image analysis techniques for studying the human body composition and its changes with increasing age to achieve timely prognosis of these pathologies.",QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES,9449456,SC3GM113754,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Technique', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delaware', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Techniques', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age related', 'biophysical model', 'bone', 'clinical imaging', 'disease diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'morphometry', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'reduced muscle strength', 'sarcopenia', 'statistics', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY,SC3,2018,64155,4139254,-0.007931231969643222
"Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD Abstract Up to 80% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) will suffer from cognitive symptoms, including impaired attention, planning, reasoning and working memory as well as hallucinations, visuospatial dysfunction, and delusions. These impairments lead to mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PDD) in PD. Cognitive symptoms of PD are associated with enormous cost to our society. There are no clear biomarkers and few effective treatments for PD-MCI/PDD. Because risk for PD increases dramatically with age, this problem will surge as our population grows older. The mechanisms contributing to PD-MCI/PDD are unknown. Our group has found that low-frequency (1-8 Hz; or delta/theta bands) brain rhythms might be helpful in diagnosing cognitive dysfunction in PD. This delta/theta activity originates from areas of medial frontal cortex such as the anterior cingulate, and is detectable by mid-frontal scalp EEG electrodes. We have found that mid-frontal delta/theta brain rhythms are engaged when healthy individuals detect novelty, errors, and conflict, or make decisions. These rhythms are attenuated in PD patients. Our working model is that PD patients manifest diverse neuronal and network deficits that impair mid-frontal delta/theta activity, leading to failures in engaging cognitive control. These abnormalities contribute to PD-MCI and PDD. In this proposal we combine `big-data' machine learning tools, intraoperative neurophysiology in humans, and new brain-stimulation paradigms to investigate the role of mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms in PD. We will test the overall hypothesis that mid-frontal delta/theta impairments are a mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in PD. In Aim 1 we will determine if mid-frontal delta/theta activity predicts PD-MCI/PDD. In Aim 2 we will use unique intraoperative recordings to determine how delta/theta activity within medial frontal cortex influences neurons in the subthalamic nucleus, a key site of functional convergence that is targeted by current deep-brain stimulation for PD. Notably, the subthalamic nucleus is a compact structure that receives highly overlapping input from cognitive and motor cortical regions, making it likely that our recordings will capture cognitive processing within this nucleus. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine if subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation at delta/theta frequencies improves cognitive control in PD patients. Because these experiments involve recordings across several PD patient populations (Aim 1), from single subthalamic neurons (Aim 2), and brain stimulation (Aim 3), each of these aims will provide independent mechanistic insight into cognitive dysfunction in PD. PD is a complex disease, but if cortical EEG abnormalities are a consistent theme it might inspire new diagnostic tools or new brain-stimulation therapies for cognitive dysfunction in PD. Results from this proposal could also be important for other neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease.     Public Health Relevance Cognitive symptoms of Parkinson's disease are an enormous public health problem. Here, we will ana- lyze brain rhythms that are involved in cognitive processing and also dysfunctional in Parkinson's dis- ease. We will use these brain rhythms to guide novel brain stimulation that has the potential to treat dementia and cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease.  ",Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD,9569720,R01NS100849,"['Acetylcholine', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alpha Rhythm', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reaction Time', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theta Rhythm', 'Time', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'alpha synuclein', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'implantation', 'improved', 'insight', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'motor symptom', 'neuronal patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2018,77376,193405667,0.03445585380935535
"Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits Project Summary  Of the diverse features of the mammalian motor repertoire, skilled limb movements have become some of the more impressive and indispensable ways of interacting with the environment. The susceptibility of these movements to neurodegenerative disease and injury underscores the need for a better understanding of how neural circuits orchestrate these dexterous behaviors. This goal demands sophisticated experimental scrutiny at both neural and behavioral levels, and while the emergence of genetic tools for monitoring and manipulating neural circuits in mice has been transformative, the development of motor behavioral assays has not kept pace. Typically, a single behavioral test is applied to the question at hand, precluding a more comprehensive description of why relevant neural circuits have evolved their particular anatomical and functional attributes. Moreover, in the study of limb motor control, primate-inspired behavioral paradigms tend to be applied to the mouse by default, risking neglect of a more complete and naturalistic account of motor circuit function.  Ethology emphasizes an unbiased study of behavior under natural conditions. This proposal describes an ethological approach for the quantification and categorization of skilled limb movements in mice, enabling a depth and breadth of behavioral analysis that more closely aligns with the complexity of the underlying neural circuits. Several complementary approaches for unbiased behavioral quantification of mouse limb movements in enriched environments will be developed in parallel: a set of optical techniques enabling automated three- dimensional reconstruction of limb and digit posture and trajectory; and an approach that leverages advances in the miniaturization of motion sensors for camera-free limb tracking that can be integrated seamlessly with neural and electromyography (EMG) recordings. Through iterative refinement, this multifaceted strategy should highlight the strengths and mitigate potential drawbacks of each tracking method, providing a suite of complementary quantitative tools. Kinematic, kinetic, EMG and neural data collected across diverse behavioral contexts will be used to guide machine learning-based classification of natural structure in limb movements and in their underlying neural circuits. As a proving ground for how these naturalistic behavioral analyses can be integrated with the genetic dissection of neural circuit function, a set of molecularly defined motor circuits will be probed using novel optogenetic tools that permit selective inhibition at defined axon collateral terminals. This combination of projection specific genetic perturbation and ethologically driven behavioral analyses will provide a powerful lens through which to view the fine-grained functional organization of mammalian motor circuits. More generally, this merging of molecular and systems neuroscience approaches will offer a novel way to explore and compare fine motor control across species, equipping the field with a more comprehensive and standardized approach to study skilled behavior, and helping lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of behavioral deficits associated with neural circuit dysfunction. Project Narrative Skilled limb movements play a central role in mammalian behavior, from the seemingly mundane to the astoundingly athletic – yet little is known about how specific neural circuits orchestrate limb motor output to ensure precision and dexterity. To identify the neural basis of skilled behaviors, a more comprehensive and quantitative understanding of natural limb movements in mice is needed to take better advantage of the powerful genetic accessibility of this model system. The ability to track and define these skilled, natural movements will enable a more sensitive and empirical exploration of the neural control of behavior, and should lay the groundwork for more effective diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits caused by disease or injury.",Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits,9632111,DP2NS105555,"['Anatomy', 'Athletic', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Electromyography', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethology', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Injury', 'Kinetics', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Predisposition', 'Primates', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral study', 'dexterity', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'kinematics', 'lens', 'limb movement', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,DP2,2018,99879,65771974,0.007219107500773574
"GAZE AND THE VISUAL CONTROL OF FOOT PLACEMENT WHEN WALKING OVER ROUGH TERRAIN PROJECT SUMMARY & ABSTRACT  Human locomotion through natural environments requires the coordination of all levels of the sensorimotor hierarchy, from the cortical areas involved in processing of visual information and high level planning to the subcortical and spinal structures involved in the regulation of the gait and posture. However, despite the complex neural bases of human locomotion, the output is highly regular and well organized around the basic physical dynamics and biomechanics that define the stability and energetic costs of moving a bipedal body through space. There is a rich and growing body of literature describing detailed knowledge each of the individual components of human locomotion, including neural mechanisms, muscular neuromechanics, and biomechanics. However, very little research exists on the way that visual input is used to dynamically control locomotion, and the overall control structure of the integrated neural and mechanical system during natural locomotion through a complex and dynamic world. This lack of integrative research not only restricts the breadth of impact of research from these individual disciplines, but also limits our ability to develop adequate treatment plans for loss of locomotor ability deriving from systems-level factors such as aging, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease. In order to to fill this critical gap in our knowledge about human locomotion, it is necessary to develop an integrated research program that examines the interactions between the visual, neural, and mechanical bases of human movement through the world. In service of this general goal, this proposal outlines research projects aimed at specific unanswered questions about locomotion over different terrains. This proposal comprises three specific research and training aims on the visual control of locomotion over rough terrain. Aim 1 focuses on the behavioral task itself, Aim 2 investigates the sensory stimulus experienced during real-world locomotion, and Aim 3 examines the motor integration of visually specified goals into the ongoing gait cycle. Aim 1 investigates effects of changing environmental uncertainty and task demands on gaze allocation strategies during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 2 analyzes and models the visual stimulus experienced during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 3 determines how visually specified target footholds and targets are integrated into the ongoing preferred steady-state gait. Together these aims will significantly advance our understanding of how humans use vision to control their movement through the natural world, which greatly increase our ability to develop clinical diagnosis and treatment for loss of locomotor function.

"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets.

"New Approach to Quantitative Beta Amyloid Imaging Using PET Summary This project seeks to prove the commercial feasibility of a new approach to analyzing dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) data that would improve sensitivity, quantitative accuracy, and accessibility of imaging the biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent progress in understanding the nature of neurodegenerative diseases — especially evidence that the onset of cognitive symptoms of AD can be mitigated —amplify the critical need of improved quantitative evaluation of AD biomarkers. Dynamic PET may be the most accurate modality capable of achieving this goal. However, current strategies of analyzing dynamic PET images either require complex acquisition protocols with invasive arterial blood sampling procedures or rely on accuracy-degrading approximations such as compartment modeling. We have developed Intelligent Dynamics-Driven Quantitative Diagnostics (IDDQD), a novel processing approach based on factor analysis of dynamic structures with partial clustering used to initiate the process. We have shown that an early version of IDDQD can extract blood and tissue tracer dynamics and the corresponding spatial distributions from 11C-PIB PET scans. SolvingDynamics Inc plans to offer a Research-as-a-Service data processing workflow that will apply IDDQD to dynamic brain PET datasets acquired by the customers, producing accurate quantitative tracer dynamics time-activity curves (TACs) and the distribution of the targeted tissues, including the AD biomarkers beta-amyloid and tau. Our proprietary algorithm does not require the tracer dynamics model to achieve steady state, so a shorter scan can be used to generate results of similar or better accuracy than those produced by current approaches, such as reference tissue- based methods. In this proposal, SolvingDynamics seeks to prove the feasibility of our proposed approach by comparing the diagnostics obtained using IDDQD analysis of dynamic PET data and those obtained from independent measurements. A subcontract group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has been conducting dynamic 11C-PIB PET studies for several years and has accumulated over 70 cases with PET data matched to both cognitive-memory tests and to post-mortem pathology studies. SolvingDynamics will retrospectively apply its analysis technique to these datasets and compare its computed tissue distributions to standardized uptake volume ratio (SUVR) and distribution volume ratio (DVR) data. A subset of 20 dynamic 11C-PIB PET datasets ranging in length from 15 to 90 minutes will also be analyzed in order to validate the feasibility of reducing the imaging time. In addition, similar studies aimed at reducing imaging time with IDDQD will be performed for 20 PET scans acquired using 18F-AV1451 tracer to image tau. PROJECT NARRATIVE Positron emission tomography image analysis methodology to be validated in this project aims to improve sensitivity and specificity of tissue analysis in dynamic positron emission tomography, improving diagnosis of Alzheimer's diseases and other neurodegenerative disorders. The main benefits are expected in medical research developing treatments for dementia and in clinical diagnosis, allowing early detection of the disease with less cost and reduced radiation dose to the patients.",New Approach to Quantitative Beta Amyloid Imaging Using PET,9557192,R43AG059500,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Autopsy', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Factor Analysis', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Injections', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'amyloid imaging', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'heuristics', 'human subject', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'molecular imaging', 'neuropathology', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiotracer', 'tau Proteins', 'uptake']",NIA,"SOLVINGDYNAMICS, INC.",R43,2018,149871,0,-0.07189437922575596
"Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08) is to provide the candidate with extensive training in 1) machine learning, 2) neuroimaging and 3) developmental psychopathology to conduct independent investigations on the neurobiology that underlies psychopathology that results from childhood maltreatment. There is strong evidence that maltreatment during childhood results in differences across multiple circuits in the developing brain. The extent that affected circuits are involved in psychopathology, however, is unclear. Determining which circuits are involved is necessary to develop interventions that target specific neurobiological systems. The primary aims of the proposed studies are to clarify the involvement of multiple brain features (e.g., structures and functional activations) in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These aims will be accomplished with machine learning. Machine learning is a set of computer-based learning methods in which meaningful theoretical models are derived from empirical data. This proposal builds on the candidate's prior training in clinical psychology, neurobiological models of traumatic stress, and advanced computational methods to develop expertise in: 1) computational methods that include machine learning, genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks, 2) the collection of multi-modal neuroimaging data and 3) the effect of maltreatment on development. Additional professional development training will include grantsmanship, manuscript preparation, and research ethics. To achieve these aims, the candidate has assembled an accomplished mentorship team of experts that span a range of disciplines including developmental psychopathology, computational science, and neuroscience. The training and mentorship will allow the candidate to conduct a series of research studies with two primary aims. The first is to use machine learning to develop a model that integrates structural and task-based functional MRI data to differentiate adolescents with a history of maltreatment from controls. Identifying the features that best differentiate these groups will determine which circuits are implicated in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These models will be constructed with data from an existing high-dimensional database that was obtained by project mentors. The second aim is to obtain pilot data on the association between variations in brain regions and the severity of psychopathology in a sample of maltreated adolescents. When this research is completed, the brain features most affected by maltreatment will be identified and the relation between these brain features and observable symptoms will be quantified. Such knowledge will provide a set of targets for treatment and assist in our classification of maltreatment-related mental illness. The experience and data obtained from this project will position the candidate to pursue future NIH funding to further examine the neurobiology of maltreatment- related psychopathology in adolescence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Child abuse prior to adolescence is associated with marked impairment across the lifespan and is a significant public health concern. There is considerable need to understand how abuse in childhood affects the developing brain and how these changes correspond to observable maladaptive behaviors during adolescence. This project aims to quantify the contribution of brain circuits to maltreatment-related psychopathology in order to improve diagnosis and identify targets for intervention.",Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning,9493548,K08MH107661,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08)', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'computer science', 'conditioned fear', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'maltreatment', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'putamen', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K08,2018,163943,66370127,0.011118837602669095
"MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy parkinsonian type (MSA-P), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are costly and devastating neurodegenerative diseases. They have overlapping clinical manifestations and diagnosis remains challenging in many cases. Thus far no effective treatments have been developed to meaningfully slow or stop their progression. This is due in part to a lack of tools to objectively measure degeneration in the neural systems affected by each of these diseases. Availability of such tools would assist clinical diagnosis, facilitate selection of appropriate patient groups for trial recruitment, and enable objective measurement of treatment outcomes. Recent MRI studies suggest that disease-specific brain changes can, indeed, be identified in these parkinsonian diseases. The objective of this research is to identify univariable markers and multivariable MRI signatures that capture distinct patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to accurately distinguish these diseases.  To accomplish this the investigators use 3 Tesla MRI contrasts sensitive to key features of neurodegeneration to 1) identify structures damaged by PD, MSA-P and PSP and 2) to quantify the extent of damage in each neural system in parkinsonian diseases. Specifically, the investigators use neuromelanin- sensitive MRI to measure neuromelanin loss and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and R2* imaging to measure iron accumulation in patients with PD, MSA-P, and PSP. Using these contrasts and an innovative region of interest (ROI) selection approach, they reproducibly measure patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems. In Aim 1 the investigators use neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to study neuromelanin loss in PD, MSA-P and PSP in to identify univariable disease features that are differentially affected by parkinsonian diseases and may assist distinguishing these conditions. In Aim 2 they use QSM and R2* MRI to study ROIs differentially impacted by PD, MSA-P and PSP to identify iron accumulation biomarkers to help distinguish these diseases. In Aim 3 the investigators apply machine learning classification algorithms to identify multivariable MRI signatures of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to differentiate PD, MSA-P and PSP. Study outputs will be candidate MRI biomarkers and disease signatures. The long term goal of this research is to further develop these outputs for use as clinical diagnostic tools and as biomarkers for subject selection and outcome measurement in clinical trials.  Through this career award Dr. Huddleston will gain new skills in MRI methods, data science, and neural systems imaging in parkinsonian diseases. These new skills will enable Dr. Huddleston to design and lead interdisciplinary neuroimaging biomarker studies for Parkinson’s disease and related disorders. His mentor team is comprised of leaders in their fields. This team and the dynamic research environment at Emory University provide the necessary support for Dr. Huddleston to successfully transition to scientific independence. There is an urgent public health need for new treatments to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy, and objective tools to distinguish these diseases for clinical and research purposes are lacking. The outputs of the proposed research will be candidate MRI biomarkers and multivariable MRI signatures to differentiate these conditions. These candidate biomarkers may be developed for use in clinical trial designs to increase their odds of success, and they may also assist clinical diagnosis.",MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism,9666652,K23NS105944,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical assessments', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Iron', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple System Atrophy', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Progressive Supranuclear Palsy', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Red nucleus structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Subjects Selections', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromelanin', 'neuron loss', 'nigrostriatal system', 'novel', 'pars compacta', 'patient screening', 'putamen', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2018,192564,507546965,0.02828329405385704
"Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery Recent years have seen rapid growth in the availability of large, complex functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets of the human brain. However, the potential of this fMRI Big Data is presently limited by our understanding of the neural sources that contribute to fMRI signals. Fluctuations in arousal (i.e., in the level wakefulness and alertness) are known to modulate cognitive and behavioral processes and to display prominent alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders. Yet, since the vast majority of fMRI datasets lack neurophysiological or behavioral indices of arousal, fMRI Big Data cannot be readily harnessed to understand human brain arousal in health and disease. Recent data-driven approaches attempt to fill this gap but have limitations. The overall goal of this proposal is to increase the transformative potential of fMRI Big Data for human neuroscience through a novel analytic framework for detecting arousal fluctuations from fMRI data alone. We will accomplish this goal by developing and disseminating tools for modeling arousal fluctuations based on powerful statistical learning methods (Specific Aim 1). We will apply these models to large fMRI databases of healthy aging and Alzheimer’s Disease, both of which are associated with altered arousal (Specific Aims 2 and 3). We will capitalize on these databases to determine how knowledge of brain arousal fluctuations improves neuroimaging biomarkers of aging- and neurodegenerative disease-related changes in human brain function, and the extent to which arousal itself constitutes an informative biomarker of these states. This research would, moreover, increase the reliability and translational potential of fMRI studies more broadly by providing the ability to account for these major neural (arousal) state changes. These immediate research goals form a strong bridge with my long-term research objective of understanding principles of brain function by developing and innovatively adapting methods for the analysis of large and complex neuroimaging datasets. This objective is enabled by the mentored training plan, where I will (i) develop expertise in cutting-edge machine learning techniques and (ii) apply these techniques to multimodal neuroimaging data. The two co-mentors have complementary expertise that align, respectively, with these two training components. Aims 1 and 2 will span the mentored phase and part of the independent phase, while Aim 3 (application to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data) will be performed in the independent phase. The mentored environment of the NIH Intramural Research Program provides the resources for all planned data acquisition, as well as a rich community of neuroscience investigators and seminars. Interaction with the extramural (Columbia University) co-mentor will occur through frequent video conferences and several visits, with opportunities to engage with the Columbia data science community. Developing models of brain arousal fluctuations in fMRI data would contribute to our understanding of arousal mechanisms and its alteration with a variety of brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease. Further, the ability to account for arousal fluctuations in fMRI data analysis would broadly improve the sensitivity of fMRI for neuroscience and clinical research, and may be critical for developing reliable, noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.",Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery,9774474,K22ES028048,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Extramural Activities', 'Eye', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'alertness', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'biomarker development', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'dimensional analysis', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'healthy aging', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'rapid growth', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'tool', 'usability']",NIEHS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K22,2018,200616,117374875,0.021134086577435394
"A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles In the United States, 2.8 million people every year seek medical attention for traumatic brain injury (TBI), of which 80% are considered to have a mild TBI (i.e. concussion). Even in those with mild injuries, 10-20% of individuals will suffer long-term disability including seizures and emotional and behavioral issues. One of the primary challenges in TBI care is appropriately classifying this heterogeneous injury and identifying patients at risk for these chronic impairments. Conventional imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), are commonly used to classify TBI, but do not reliably capture the full extent of the injury, particularly in those patients with mild injuries. Currently, there are few molecular markers to assist in the assessment of an individual's unique injury and subsequent recovery and biomarkers are desperately needed in the field that correlate with these varied endophenotypes, track the progress of the disease, and predict clinical outcomes. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a microchip-based platform that can be used to characterize TBI and its recovery using the RNA cargo found in brain-derived circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. Unlike prior work that has mainly focused on single biomarkers, our approach measures a panel of circulating EV miRNA markers processed with machine learning algorithms, to more comprehensively capture the state of the injured and recovering brain. Our proposal combines surface marker-specific nanomagnetic isolation of brain-derived EVs from a variety of cell types, biomarker discovery using RNA sequencing, and machine learning processing of EV miRNA cargo to measure the state of injury and recovery in TBI. Nanoscale exosomes are known to shed from brain cells into the blood stream, carrying with them the molecular signatures that can be used to better diagnose and treat injuries, such as traumatic brain injury. We propose an innovative, clinically practical approach to probe the RNA contained within these nanoscale vesicles to better understand a patient's injury and recovery to better guide treatment. Our rapid and easily multiplexed platform has great potential for non-invasive diagnostics and monitoring of both secondary injury progression and drug efficacy, offers tremendous benefits for patients.",A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles,9630167,R21MH118170,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Astrocytes', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood Volume', 'Brain', 'Brain Concussion', 'Brain Edema', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Production', 'RNA', 'RNA Probes', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'drug efficacy', 'endophenotype', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'individual response', 'injured', 'injury and repair', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'manufacturability', 'medical attention', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'microchip', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'nanomagnetic', 'nanoscale', 'neuropathology', 'next generation', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'nucleic acid detection', 'outcome forecast', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ratiometric', 'research clinical testing', 'response to injury', 'technology development', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2018,206809,593605914,0.01469996728734747
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Abstract (of the Parent Award) Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. This administrative supplement proposes to add a sample of unaffected siblings (n=100, 20 per site over four years) as an additional comparison sample to the 250 OCD and 250 healthy control (HC) subjects already being studied in the parent study. These siblings will complete the same clinical, neurocognitive, and imaging measures as the 250 OCD and 250 healthy control subjects complete in the parent study.",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9689131,R01MH113250,"['Administrative Supplement', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Netherlands', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Siblings', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive task', 'disability', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2018,213060,68331629,0.011635132084070613
"Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neurological diseases occur in the absence of neurodegenerative pathology, such as neurotransmission disorders. Deficient neurotransmission is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, deterioration in synaptic function also appears during ageing, accompanied by a decline in cognitive and behavioral function. Synaptic strength and plasticity, important in cognitive functions such as memory, are affected by synaptic activity. However, the regulators of synaptic strength, either activity-dependent or independent, are far from understood. Here, I propose to explore how environmental cues and ageing can affect synaptic morphology in the nematode C. elegans, and how this correlates to synaptic function and activity. In C. elegans, which is an excellent model for neuroscience, synaptic sites can be observed with fluorescent fusion proteins. However, fluorescently labeled synaptic sites are small and faint, and obtaining large number of high-content data poses many experimental limitations. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate regulators of synaptic function through multidimensional morphological profiling of synaptic sites. This work is composed of a mentored and an independent research phase. During the mentored phase, I will develop tools that allow high-throughput quantitative multidimensional profiling of synaptic morphology in large populations of animals. These tools are based on combining microfluidics, automation, and computer vision methods for image analysis, which enable streamlined quantitative morphological characterization of synaptic sites. In addition to this, tools to determine synaptic function in the motor circuit through the quantification of locomotive activity and controlled stimulation of excitatory neurons will be developed to correlate synaptic morphology to function. The mentored phase will also include extensive training in various aspects: technology development, biology and neuroscience, and career development. The scientific environment at the institution of the mentored phase is highly collaborative and provides excellent support in terms of facilities and intellectual opportunities. During the independent research phase, I plan to apply the developed tools during the mentored phase to uncover how environmental cues can affect synaptic function through activity dependent or independent mechanisms. I will also utilize these tools to study synaptic decline during aging, and how exposure to environmental regulators of synaptic function during development can alter synaptic decline during aging. In this way, we will be able to address a biological question unapproachable with conventional methods. This approach is innovative not only because the technology developed will greatly increase the throughput and quality of characterization, but also because it proposes studying the links between form and function in synaptic sites. This project is significant because it will enable streamlined morphological studies in neuroscience, which should lead to uncovering pathways, genes and potential therapies for synaptic function deficiencies due to disease or age-related decline.

"In Vivo Mapping of Uncharted Functional Units of Tongue Motion During Speech Project Summary Tongue cancer and the treatments used to cure the disease such as glossectomy can have debilitating effects on speech and swallowing, yet not much is known about the relationship between tongue movements in speech and reconstruction choices after cancer resection. The tongue’s vital role in speaking and swallowing is executed by a uniquely complex array of muscles which deform locally into functional units. Tongue movements are governed by synergistic activation of these functional units using orthogonally oriented muscle fibers not a rigid skeletal structure. Functional units, which are regions of 3D coherent motion, are the structures that link low-level muscle activity to high-level surface tongue geometry. This link, the organization of functional units, can provide considerable insight into normal motor control and adapted tongue motion, as in patients who have had surgery for tongue cancer. However, there is poor understanding of the details of how muscle morphology contributes to function due to tongue muscle interdigitation and complex local activation. A key to understanding the relationship between the structure and function of the tongue is to identify functional units of motion in localized tongue regions and map them to muscle anatomy. A large step in this direction can be gained by developing a tool to cluster 3D coherent motion patterns from tagged MRI, and register them to muscle anatomy from high-resolution MRI. Speech motor control is a critical area of importance where platform tools for machine learning techniques are lacking. The goal of this project is to create a framework to relate the functional units to tongue muscle anatomy. This framework will enhance tongue motion analysis in medical research and clinical applications, where MRI is frequently used. To address this goal, we have already developed technologies to analyze high-resolution and tagged-MRI. The first is a detailed 3D muscle atlas based on 3D high-resolution MRI, which depicts the locations of both extrinsic and intrinsic muscles, and will be registered to each speaker to identify and track their muscles in the 3D tagged data sets. The second is software to derive 3D displacement and strain fields from tagged MR images. These displacements, strains, and derived quantities will be used to extract spatio-temporal feature vectors that define coherent regions, which will be verified with simulation. The vectors will then be input into a novel computational method using a NMF and clustering, the goal of which is to establish the functional units of speech. In addition, biomechanical simulations will be used to co-validate our findings. The concept of functional units is at the core of the proposed work, as it can provide insights into tongue muscle coordination in patients after glossectomy surgery. The research plan comprises two specific aims: (1) develop a computational method to establish functional units from MRI and (2) determine the relationship between alterations in anatomy and alterations in functional unit motion after tongue cancer treatment. Linking the functional units to the anatomy will allow the design of more focused treatments and therapies for tongue motion-related disorders. Project Narrative Functions of the tongue—speaking, eating, and breathing—are executed by using a complex muscular array to create global motions (synergies) by deforming local functional units which are intermediate structures that link muscle activity to surface tongue geometry. This project will develop new computational tools that will enable researchers and clinicians to determine the functional units of specific motions and relate them to the muscle anatomy. Such a breakthrough will dramatically improve our knowledge of the mechanisms of muscle coordination, thereby permitting improvement of diagnosis and treatment of tongue motion-related disorders.",In Vivo Mapping of Uncharted Functional Units of Tongue Motion During Speech,9452335,R21DC016047,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Bone structure', 'Breathing', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Elements', 'Excision', 'Geometry', 'Gestures', 'Glossectomy', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Fibers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Therapy', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Extracts', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Treatment-Related Cancer', 'Unit of Measure', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'digital', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'malignant tongue neoplasm', 'motor control', 'muscular structure', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predict clinical outcome', 'reconstruction', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'synergism', 'theories', 'tool', 'vector']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2018,249441,551214295,-0.06728272299953593
"Distinguishing Lipid Subtypes by Amplifying Contrast from J-Coupling Project Summary/Abstract With the global rise in obesity-related diseases and increasing recognition of the role of fat in diseases such as fatty liver, there is growing need for a noninvasive chemical assay of in vivo lipid depots. But the rich chemistry of these molecules is often ignored in MRI, which typically treats fat as a homogeneous proton species because differences in chemical shift and relaxation are difficult to distinguish in a clinical setting. Innovation: This proposal will be the first to use nonuniform echo spacing to generate J-coupling based contrast between chemically different fats. While fat spins often give monotonically decaying signal under a uniformly spaced spin echo train, J-coupling causes nonuniformly spaced spin echo trains to generate complex fingerprints, which distinguish and even quantify fats with otherwise similar MR properties. Significance: The immediate clinical impact will be to demonstrate a novel J-coupling based contrast mechanism in vivo which will contribute to a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish the 25% of the population with benign steatosis from the 2-3% with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The broader significance of this work is that this novel contrast mechanism could revolutionize the study and clinical management of many diseases associated with bioactive lipid subtypes. Approach: The aims are designed to test the hypothesis that nonuniform echo trains (1) can create contrast between different fats, which (2) will contribute to a multiparametric noninvasive protocol to distinguish benign steatosis and NASH. Aim 1 will identify the echo spacing best suited for distinguishing benign steatosis and NASH, first using density matrix simulations based on high resolution spectra of liver fat from animals with each disease, and then using experiments on whole rat livers. In Aim 2, the sequence developed in Aim 1 will be tested in humans with biopsy proven benign steatosis or NASH, along with a suite of standard methods of liver and fat characterization. This metric, and also metrics derived from conventional images, will be tested for the ability to separate these patient groups. In addition, machine learning algorithms will be used to find a metric that combines multiecho intensities with standard MR metrics. This proposal will prove the usefulness of nonuniform echo trains as a new contrast mechanism and yield a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish simple steatosis and NASH. Moreover, this general approach to distinguish fats could ultimately find a broad range of biomedical applications, such as imaging lipid based therapeutics, distinguishing the 4 fatty acids that make up 90% of the adipose stores, or detecting other lipotoxic subtypes. The results of this work will justify a larger scale study to properly validate the sensitivity to different fat species in humans. Project Narrative This proposal will prove the usefulness of nonuniform echo trains both as a new J-coupling based contrast mechanism and as part of a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish simple steatosis (~25% of the population) from patients on the NASHfibrosiscirrhosis trajectory of metabolically induced liver disease (2- 3% of the population). Moreover, this general approach to distinguish fats could ultimately find a broad range of biomedical applications, such as imaging lipid based therapeutics, distinguishing the 4 fatty acids that make up 90% of the adipose stores, or detecting other lipotoxic subtypes.

"ADNI Psychometrics: fcMRI and Machine Learning Aim 2 Supplement Project Summary/Abstract This supplement is to a funded R01 called ADNI Psychometrics. This Supplement builds on the Second Specific Aim of the funded parent grant. That Aim focused on characterizing brain structure and functioning for people with different cognitively- defined subgroups of Alzheimer's disease. The Supplement adds one technique for analyzing the structural data we are already analyzing, and adds analyses of functional data we had not previously been planning to analyze. The new technique for structural data is machine learning. We have the opportunity to collaborate with a talented faculty member in Biomedical Informatics who has specific expertise in machine learning approaches to anatomical data (J Gennari). Dr. Genarri will supervise machine learning approaches to complement the various analytical approaches we already have underway for Aim 2. The new functional data analyses incorporate measurements of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) data from resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) data collected by ADNI. Those data enable the characterization of functional connectivity. There are many levels of correlation in the analyses of longitudinal fcMRI data, and another talented faculty member in Radiology has specific expertise in analyzing these data (T Madhyastha). Dr. Madhyastha will supervise analyses of longitudinal fcMRI data from the cognitively-defined subgroups of Aim 2, which will provide important additional information regarding whether the functional connectivity patterns of people in these subgroups are similar to or different from each other. Project Narrative This Supplement proposal builds on the second aim of R01 AG 029672, ""ADNI Psychometrics (P Crane, PI) , which is to use ADNI's rich neuroimaging data to compare metabolism and brain structure correlates of cognitively defined Alzheimer's disease subgroups.

"Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets Project Summary  Morphometric analysis is a primary algorithmic tool to discover disease and drug related effects on brain anatomy. Neurological degeneration and disease manifest in subtle and varied changes in brain anatomy that can be non-local in nature and effect amounts of white and gray matter as well as relative positioning and shapes of local brain anatomy. State-of-the-art morphometry methods focus on local matter distribution or on shape variations of apriori selected anatomies but have difficulty in detecting global or regional deterioration of matter; an important effect in many neurodegenerative processes. The proposal team recently developed a morphometric analysis based on unbalanced optimal transport, called UTM, that promises to be capable to discover local and global alteration of matter without the need to apriori select an anatomical region of interest.  The goal of this proposal is to develop the UTM technology into a software tool for automated high-throughput screening of large neurological image data sets. ​A more sensitive automated morphometric analysis tool will help researchers to discover neurological effects related to disease and lead to more efficient screening for drug related effects. Project Narrative  Describing anatomical differences in neurological image data set is a key technology to non-invasively discover the effects of disease processes or drug treatments on brain anatomy. Current morphometric analysis focus on local matter composition and on the shape of a priori defined regions of interest. The goal of this proposal is to extend the capabilities of image based morphometric analysis to be able to discover regionally varying deterioration and alteration of matter without the need for fine-grained segmentations and a priori definitions of regions of interest.",Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets,9679722,R41MH118845,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Effect', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'high throughput screening', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'morphometry', 'nervous system disorder', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'research and development', 'shape analysis', 'software development', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'web services', 'white matter']",NIMH,"KITWARE, INC.",R41,2018,303226,5161939,-0.003931114232861853
"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.     What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.     What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented. Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms. By isolating the contribution of  different memory systems to learned choice, this project may help to guide future treatment strategies.",CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions,9506737,R01DA038891,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Choice Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Drug abuse', 'Eating Disorders', 'Episodic memory', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Female', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Midbrain structure', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'dopamine system', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outreach', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'role model', 'statistics', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'treatment strategy', 'undergraduate student']",NIDA,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,326829,58504236,0.021825146096111525
"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,9511925,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical translation', 'data mining', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'surgery outcome', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,328340,641965656,0.02416399865290204
"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Project Summary:  Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these chal- lenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymor- phisms, whole brain neuroimaging, bioﬂuids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mecha- nisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Speciﬁcally, in Aim 1, we develop efﬁcient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation mod- els to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efﬁciency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-speciﬁc substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic sys- tems through ordinary differential equations with random inﬂections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker proﬁles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efﬁcient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individu- alized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest beneﬁt from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art ana- lytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research com- munity. Project Narrative:  The ultimate goal of neuropsychiatric research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay disease on- set, slow disease progression, and provide effective treatment at each stage of disease. This proposal aims to develop new statistical approaches to integrate complementary sources of information from genomic measures, brain imaging biomarkers, and early clinical signs to characterize disease mechanism, progression, and treatment responses, and thereby inform the design of clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies.",Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures,9502388,R01NS073671,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hazard Models', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'minimal risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,340491,558628098,-0.016514050361938964
"Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and demographic data to predict future cognitive decline toward dementia ABSTRACT The “preclinical” phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by abnormal levels of brain amyloid accumulation in the absence of major symptoms, can last decades, and potentially holds the key to successful therapeutic strategies. Today there is an urgent need for quantitative biomarkers and genetic tests that can predict clinical progression at the individual level. This project will develop cutting edge machine learning algorithms that will mine high dimensional, multi-modal, and longitudinal data to derive models that yield individual-level clinical predictions in the context of dementia. The developed prognostic models will specifically utilize ubiquitous and affordable data types: structural brain MRI scans, saliva or blood-derived genome-wide sequence data, and demographic variables (age, education, and sex). Prior research has demonstrated that all these variables are strongly associated with clinical decline to dementia, however to date we have no model that can harvest all the predictive information embedded in these high dimensional data. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used to compute clinical predictions from high- dimensional biomedical data such as clinical scans. Yet, most prior ML methods were developed for applications where the ``prediction’’ task was about concurrent condition (e.g., discriminate cases and controls); and established risk factors (e.g., age), multiple modalities (e.g., genotype and images) and longitudinal data were not fully exploited. This application’s core innovation will be to develop rigorous, flexible, and practical ML methods that can fully exploit multi-modal, longitudinal, and high- dimensional biomedical data to compute prognostic clinical predictions. The proposed project will build on the PI’s strong background in computational modeling and analysis of large-scale biomedical data. We will employ an innovative Bayesian ML framework that offers the flexibility to handle and exploit real-life longitudinal and multi-modal data. We hypothesize that the developed models will be more useful than alternative benchmarks for identifying preclinical individuals who are at heightened risk of imminent clinical decline. We will use a statistically rigorous approach for discovery, cross-validation, and benchmarking the developed tools. This project will yield freely distributed, documented, and validated software and models for predicting future clinical progression based on whole-genome, longitudinal structural MRI and demographic data. We believe the algorithms and software we develop will yield invaluable tools for stratifying preclinical AD subjects in drug trials, optimizing future therapies, and minimizing the risk of adverse effects. NARRATIVE Emerging technologies allow us to identify clinically healthy subjects harboring Alzheimer’s pathology. While many of these preclinical individuals progress to dementia, sometimes quite quickly, others remain asymptomatic for decades. The proposed project will develop sophisticated data mining algorithms to derive models that can predict future clinical decline based on ubiquitous, easy- to-collect, and affordable data modalities: brain MRI scans, saliva or blood- derived whole-genome sequences, and clinical and demographic variables.","Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and demographic data to predict future cognitive decline toward dementia",9519804,R01AG053949,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anatomy', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Harvest', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Prevention approach', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Saliva', 'Scanning', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Site', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'aging brain', 'base', 'case control', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive testing', 'data mining', 'flexibility', 'functional disability', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'risk minimization', 'sex', 'software development', 'sound', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NIA,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,410000,91477866,-0.0601268231723829
"The Gut Microbiome in Parkinson Disease Project Summary/Abstract This is a first R01 application from an early stage, new investigator and current NIEHS K01 awardee. Parkinson disease (PD) is a disabling neurodegenerative disease for which there is no cure. Years before the diagnosis of PD and the onset of motor symptoms, PD patients develop non-motor symptoms, including, importantly, constipation and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Constipation affects over 80% of PD patients and is one of the strongest risk factors for PD. Recent research shows that the enteric nervous system in the gut and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve which anatomically links the GI system to the brain, are among the first and most severely affected by alpha-synuclein pathology characteristic of PD5 leading to the hypothesis that the gastrointestinal tract might be the site of initiation of PD. We propose to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the relation between human gut microbiome and PD, focusing on the pre- onset microbiome. We will do this by building on an ongoing Department of Defense funded project that has identified participants with pre-parkinson syndrome (PPS - defined as the co- occurrence of constipation, pRBD (probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder) and hyposmia) that in a pilot study has been associated with a ~200 fold increase in PD risk. Studying the microbiome among this group, who are highly likely to develop PD or are already in the premotor state, will give us a unique look at the microbiome in PD patients prior to any potential disease-associated effects of changes in diet and lifestyle that may have confounded prior case-control studies. The proposed study will take advantage of 25 years of prospectively collected data on environmental and dietary exposures and disease outcomes in two prospective cohorts of men and women. Project Narrative Our appreciation of the impact of the gut microbiome on brain health, and especially PD, is in the early stages. This study will be the first to examine the gut microbiome in participants with premotor PD and compare it to healthy controls, controls with constipation and to recently onset PD cases. This project will thus advance our understanding of how the human gut microbiome contributes to the pathophysiology of PD and will contribute to the development of tools needed for a preclinical diagnosis and/or treatment.",The Gut Microbiome in Parkinson Disease,9343057,R01NS097723,"['Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Bacteria', 'Biometry', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Butyrates', 'Caffeine', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Constipation', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Department of Defense', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Enteric Nervous System', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Feces', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gait', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genes', 'Health Professional', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Mucous Membrane', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Onset of illness', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Pilot Projects', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Proteobacteria', 'REM Sleep Behavior Disorder', 'Ralstonia', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Update', 'Vagus nerve structure', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Woman', 'alpha synuclein', 'brain health', 'cigarette smoking', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'dorsal motor nucleus', 'dysbiosis', 'follow-up', 'gastrointestinal', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'hyposmia', 'illness length', 'men', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiome research', 'microbiota profiles', 'motor symptom', 'non-motor symptom', 'posture instability', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive signature', 'prospective', 'stool sample', 'tool development']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R01,2018,418825,7208224,0.02464099264154083
"4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging allows safe, non-invasive measurement of brain structures and functions and their changes over time. This has led to many longitudinal studies to discover imaging biomarkers for better prediction of brain disorders. However, the associated longitudinal changes are often tiny within a short follow-up time, and are thus difficult to detect by conventional methods since the measurement errors could be larger than the actual changes. Also, with the significant increase of data with longitudinal follow-ups, it becomes challenging to capture a small set of effective imaging biomarkers from large data for accurate disease prediction. This issue becomes even more critical when there is missing data in the longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. The goal of this renewal project is to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. These tools wil allow elucidating subtle abnormal changes that would be otherwise left undetected with existing tools. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will create a novel multi-atlas guided 4D brain labelling method for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject. All longitudinal images of each subject will be first aligned by a novel groupwise 4D registration algorithm that can more accurately estimate longitudinal deformations. Then, these aligned longitudinal images can be further registered with multiple atlases guided by a graph that locally connects all (subject and atlas) images, thus obtaining more accurate/consistent registration and ROI labeling for the longitudinal images of same subject. In Aim 2, we will further create a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model to effectively integrate serial imaging and non-imaging biomarkers for early diagnosis and prediction of brain status. Also, to further extract effective biomarkers, a new machine learning technique, called deep learning, will be adapted to learn high-level features for helping prediction with a novel temporally-constrained group sparse learning method, which is able to predict clinical scores consistently for future time-points. Finally, in Aim 3, we will create nove methods to deal with missing data in longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. In particular, we will first develop several data completion methods (including matrix completion) to complete the missing data. Then, instead of designing a single predictor that may be limited, we will design multiple diverse predictors (by multi-task learning) for ensemble prediction, thus significantly increasing the overall prediction performance. Also, considering that the individual's future images are not available at early time-points, to improve the clinical utility of the proposed methods, we will apply our models to various cases with different numbers of longitudinal images and then further train them jointly to achieve the overall best performance. Note that the performance of all proposed methods will be evaluated in this project for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) study, although they are also applicable to studies of other brain disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel multi-atlases guided 4D brain labelling framework for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across the longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject by harnessing the manifold of anatomical variation of 4D image and the atlases, 2) a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model that will automatically learn the relevant information from imaging and non-imaging data of past time-points to predict future status of brain, and 3) novel methods for missing data completion and then multiple diverse predictors for ensemble prediction. We will also make these methods practical for clinical diagnostics setting. Finally, we will package all our methods into a softwar tool and release it publicly, as we have done before. The methods that we will develop can find their applications not only in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that will be used as example in this project, but also in other fields such as longitudinal monitoring of other neurological diseases (i.e., schizophrenia) and measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain.",4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease,9422606,R01EB008374,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Schizophrenia', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'serial imaging', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,451650,511185245,-0.017135297644644505
"Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data 1. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The study of translational biomarkers in brain disorders is a very challenging and fruitful approach, which will empower a better understanding of healthy and diseased brains. This project will promote the translation of advanced engineering solutions and mathematic tools to novel neuroimaging applications in psychiatric disorders including major depression disorder(MDD), bipolar disorders(BD) and schizophrenia(SZ), allowing sophisticated and powerful analyses on highly complex datasets. To date, the unifying syndrome classification (ICD-9/10;DSM-IV/5) for these mental disorders obscures our knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and cannot guide optimal treatments. For example, there is no biomarker that is able to precisely predict response of MDD to some treatments. One reason lies in that most neuroimaging “prediction” studies to date have used a single imaging measure or reported simple “correlation” relationships, without considering multimodal cross- information, or lack of multi-site validation. Hence, developing novel data mining techniques such as deep learning, fusion with references, and sparse regression etc. can complement and exploit the richness of neuroimaging data, which can be promising avenues to identify objective biomarkers, which goes beyond a more descriptive use of brain imaging as traditionally used in studies of brain diseases. We will develop 3 novel data- driven methods: 1) A supervised fusion model that can provide insight on how cognitive impairment(in SZ) or epigenetic factors (miR-132 dysregulation in MDD) may affect covarying brain function and structure, which uses different clinical measures as reference to guide multimodal MRI fusion; 2) A cutting-edge prediction model that is able to identify imaging biomarkers for precise, individualized prediction of clinical outcomes, e.g., remission status of MDD patients after Electroconvulsive Treatment(ECT). 3) We will draw on advances and ideas from deep neural networks(DNN) combined with layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP), to classify multiple group of psychiatric disorders by using functional connectivity measures, and to trace back the most predictive functional networks from the black box of deep learning by LRP. All above proposed methods will be applied to the big data containing multimodal imaging and behavioral information(n=5000) pooled from existing studies, to investigate biomarkers that can help solve specific clinical difficulties. This pioneering study may provide an urgently-needed paradigm shift in the treatment and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, thereby guiding personalized clinical care. Accomplishment of this project has great potential to discover neuroimaging biomarkers that have been missed by existing approaches, lead to earlier and more effective interventions, suggesting a significant translational impact. Project Narrative Psychiatric imaging is struggling with identifying robust biomarkers. Existing approaches do not fully leverage the power of multimodal data, despite evidence that such information is highly informative. We will draw on advances and ideas from fields of deep neural networks, supervised learning and dynamic functional information, to capture rich information from multimodal imaging big data, thus identify replicable and precise biomarkers that are able to predict individual clinical measures and help for intervention. We will pool big data from ongoing projects in multiple cohorts, consisting a large imaging and behavioral dataset (n~5000) to apply clinical applications that will have profound translational medicine impact on schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorders.",Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data,9733448,R56MH117107,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'CREB1 gene', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Engineering', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'depressed patient', 'disease classification', 'effective intervention', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'translational medicine', 'treatment response']",NIMH,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R56,2018,453304,5898658,0.019666919074412724
"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research. We develop new knowledge and a novel tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding volunteers in innovative neuroscience research, to ensure ethical participation, enhance trust in science, and accelerate discovery.",Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain,9564206,R01MH114856,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell model', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Human Volunteers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Personhood', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'brain research', 'clinical care', 'decision research', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'insight', 'member', 'neuroethics', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'patient engagement', 'prevent', 'programs', 'sound', 'standard measure', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'volunteer']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,465508,560644462,0.024940801571904783
"Characterizing Alzheimer's Disease with INSPECDS: Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT  It is estimated that Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia will surpass cancer as the leading cause of death by the year 2040. Alzheimer's is the leading cause of dementia, followed by synucleinopathies, including dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), Fronto-temporal dementia and Vascular dementia. Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, biomarkers, and treatment options for Alzheimer's disease, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process. To address this unmet need Advanced Brain Monitoring (ABM) proposes to leverage day and night assessment technologies to create an Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS) to profile Alzheimer's and other dementias. The core components of the INSPECDS platform will be the Alertness and Memory Profiler (AMP), the Sleep Profiler, and integrated machine-learning, classification algorithms, hosted on a secure, cloud-based, infrastructure for automated data processing, analysis, and reporting. The AMP was developed and validated intially for the purpose of detecting the neurocognitive effects of sleep deprivation in adults diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea but has more recently been applied to assess Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The AMP is unique among neurocognitive testing platforms in that it is the only one which integrates advanced, electrophysiological measures (e.g., 24-channel, wireless EEG and ECG) during the performance of computerized neurocognitive tasks and has proven effective in characterizing cognitive decline in Alzheimer's. This advanced capability permits researchers to explore real- time relations between fluctuations in alertness, discrete cognitive functions, and specific neural processes believed to subserve observed performance deficits in Alzheimer's and other dementias. The Sleep Profiler is an FDA-cleared, easily applied, wireless-EEG device that was developed and validated to measure sleep architecture for in-home sleep studies with submental (chin) EMG and wireless accelerometers to monitor head and limb movements to quantify the characteristics of REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD), considered to be a prodromal expression of synucleinopathy. Furthermore, the application of sophisticated, machine- learning, classification algorithms will streamline the processing and analyses of these data to derive statistical probabilities of Alzheimer's and other dementia subtypes. The overarching goal of the current, Direct-to-Phase II, SBIR project is to finalize implementation of a secure, cloud-based infrastructure to compile the data obtained from the AMP and Sleep Profiler, train classification algorithms to discriminate among Alzheimer's and other dementia subtypes, validate diagnostic accuracy, and integrate optimized classifiers within the cloud- based architecture. Once completed, the INSPECDS system will be the first clinical research tool of its kind and find immediate application in both university-based research settings and pharmaceutical industry clinical trials to aid in the endophenotypic stratification of Alzheimer's and other dementias. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, clinical course, and treatment options for Alzheimer's and other neurodengenerative diseases, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process.

"Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets Project Summary During the past three decades non-invasive functional brain imaging has developed immensely in terms of measurement technologies, analysis methods, and innovative paradigms to capture information about brain function both in healthy and diseased individuals. Although functional MRI (fMRI) has become very useful, it only provides indirect information about neuronal activity through the neurovascular coupling with a limited temporal resolution. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) remain the only available noninvasive techniques capable of directly measuring the electrophysiological activity with a millisecond resolution. During the past eight years we have developed, with NIH support, the MNE-Python software, which covers multiple methods of data preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. To further extend our software to meet the needs of a growing user base and reflect recent developments in the MEG/EEG field we will pursue three specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will: (i) Create an all-embracing suite of noise cancellation tools incorporating and extending methods present in different MEG systems; (ii) Implement device independent methods for head-movement determination and compensation on the basis of head movement data recorded during a MEG session; (iii) Develop methods for automatic tagging of artifacts using machine learning approaches. In Aim 2 our focus is to extend the software to make modern distributed computing resources easily usable in processing and to allow for remote visualization without the need to move large amounts of data across the network. Finally, in Aim 3, we will continue to develop MNE-Python using best programming practices ensuring multiplatform compatibility, extensive web-based documentation, training and forums, and hands-on training workshops. As a result of these developments the MNE-Python will be able to effectively process large number of subjects and huge amounts data ensuing and from multi-site studies harmoniously across different MEG/EEG systems. Narrative MEG and EEG can be used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. However, widespread use of these methods especially in large populations has been problematic because of the lack of well-established analysis approaches, which map the sensor data into the brain space for detailed temporal, spatial, and connectivity analysis.

"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,9536156,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Women&apos', 's Health Nursing', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'motor symptom', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2018,563079,146629556,0.01768316713774747
"Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular interactions with the environment form the basis of health and disease for all organisms. Exposure to nutrients, toxins, and neighboring cells trigger coordinated molecular responses that impact cell function and metabolism in a beneficial, adaptive, or detrimental manner. Although the benefits of multicellularity for the formation of complex tissue structures or the function of entire organ systems has been long appreciated, it has only recently been understood that microbial inhabitants of vertebrates also have a tremendous impact on host cell function and dysfunction. Despite this, an understanding of these interactions has not moved beyond simple associations, and there are virtually no molecular technologies available that adequately define how a complex microbial ecosystem impacts host cell function, or how the host response to microbial colonization affects the bacterial community. This gap in knowledge is striking when one considers the broad and significant impact that microbes have on human health. In this application, we propose to expressly fill this knowledge gap through development of a novel multimodal imaging pipeline that will provide 3-dimensional information on the molecular heterogeneity of microbial communities and the immune response at the host-pathogen interface.  This proposal combines our expertise in immunology, infection biology, mass spectrometry, small animal imaging, machine learning, and computer vision to develop an integrated multimodal visualization method for studying infectious disease. Our unique approach will computationally combine ultra-high speed (~50px/s) MALDI-TOF images, ultra-high mass resolution (>200,000 resolving power) MALDI FTICR IMS, metal imaging by LA-ICP-IMS, high-spatial resolution optical microscopy, and MR imaging using data-driven image fusion. This strategy will enable 3-D molecular images to be generated for thousands of elements, metabolites, lipids, and proteins with an unprecedented combination of chemical specificity and spatial fidelity more than 50x faster than is currently possible. We will use this next-generation imaging capability to (i) define the heterogeneous microbial subpopulations throughout the 3-D volume of a S. aureus community, (ii) uncover the host molecules that form the abscess and accumulate to restrict microbial growth in murine models, and (iii) elucidate molecular markers that differentiate in vivo biofilms at the host-pathogen interface, between abscesses at various stages of progression, and under distinct degrees of nutrient stress. These studies will uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will enable detailed views of the molecular components of infectious disease with unprecedented resolution through the development of a multimodal, 3-dimensional imaging platform. The proposed technologies will improve throughput and molecular specificity, enable automated high-precision and high-accuracy image alignment, and allow for descriptions of molecular signals in 3-D through the fusion of multi-modal imaging data. These studies will uncover targets for therapeutic intervention and antibiotic development and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research.",Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry,9659850,R01AI138581,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abscess', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance', 'Functional disorder', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nutrient', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'animal imaging', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'body system', 'commensal bacteria', 'experimental study', 'host colonization', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbial community', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'protein expression', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'virtual']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,593526,377931988,-0.013638435752697294
"High resolution mapping of the genetic risk for disease in the aging brain ABSTRACT Brain structure undergoes changes throughout life as part of the normal healthy aging process, yet some genetic factors embedded in our DNA are believed to alter and potentially accelerate the aging process within the brain. While numerous neuroimaging studies have aimed to map the genetics of dementia, differences in populations and approaches confounded with the small effect sizes attributable to any single genetic variant leads to inconsistencies in findings and limited resources to investigate the truth. Dozens of neuroimaging genetic studies have been collected around the world to help better understand the link. However, the independent nature by which the studies often operate may be limiting scientific advance. Instead of collecting new data to answer the same questions, we harmonize brain mapping efforts across existing studies and pool information to not only study differences between the healthy and demented brain, but also examine normal healthy aging trends, and determine the first signs of deviation, and map out the neurobiological effect of genes that confer risk for dementia. In our effort, we aim to pinpoint mechanistic trajectories and brain circuits by which the widely studied ApoE4 genetic haplotype affects brain throughout life. Despite being identified as a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease over 20 years ago, the effects on the brain in populations around the world are remarkably inconsistent. With novel brain mapping techniques across tens of thousands of individuals across the lifespan, we will perform the most well powered brain mapping initiative and build necessary tools to invite other researchers from around the world to add confidence to the findings. We will also determine – with unprecedented power -- how the aggregate risk for AD promotes accelerated brain degeneration with novel expedited longitudinal linear mixed modeling techniques for large scale epidemiological genetic studies with repeat data. Our proposal brings together contributions from multidisciplinary collaborators with world renowned expertise in neurodegeneration, brain mapping, big data, artificial intelligence, epidemiology, genomics and epigenomes, statistical genetics, and molecular and biological psychiatry. Our technical expertise will provide resources for visualizing genetic results at the finest resolution and provide tools for researchers to use our harmonized analyses to structure their own aging hypotheses in populations of men and women around the world, and even target sex-specific hypotheses in aging. As new brain imaging and genetic data is becoming rapidly available, we provide the tools to harmonize the data into this workflow for years to come. Driven by the data sharing and reuse of this proposal, we provide a portal for researchers of today and tomorrow to access findings from all the studies incorporated in this proposal and add to the collective repository of effects. We hope our careful harmonization of data, along with novel mathematics, tools, and selection of targeted hypotheses will guide future collaborative studies for continuous reuse. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Brain aging is a global health concern and a major focus of dozens of large scale research initiatives around the world. Here, we propose a paradigm to use advanced brain imaging techniques in a harmonized fashion across numerous existing datasets, and to map the underlying genetic influences driving neurodegeneration across tens of thousands of individuals. We will provide advanced brain image processing, mathematical tools, and a portal for researchers to access and add to findings.",High resolution mapping of the genetic risk for disease in the aging brain,9578938,R01AG059874,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Psychiatry', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'International', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'Visualization software', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'aging brain', 'aging population', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'biobank', 'brain health', 'cognitive testing', 'data sharing', 'demented', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome', 'flexibility', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'global health', 'healthy aging', 'image processing', 'imaging genetics', 'insight', 'male', 'men', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'repository', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'sex', 'tool', 'trait', 'trend']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2018,619917,324592664,0.015277478294054198
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9534190,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit', 'response', 'reward processing', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2018,668364,68331629,0.013658969907760079
"BrainStorm: Highly Extensible Software for Advanced Electrophysiology and MEG/EEG Imaging Project Summary Electrophysiological recordings in humans and animals play an essential role in developing an understanding of the human brain. Signal recording technology spans the entire scale from invasive microelectrode single-unit recordings, through mesoscale macroelectrode measures of local field potentials, to whole-brain monitoring through measurement of scalp potentials (EEG) and extracranial magnetic fields (MEG). Analysis of these data presents a host of challenges, from low level noise removal and artifact rejection to sophisticated spatio-temporal modeling and statistical inference. The multidisciplinary neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform this analysis and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data. This proposal describes our plans to continue to develop and support Brainstorm, open-source software that meets this need. Brainstorm is a Matlab/Java multi-platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows) software package for analysis and visualization of electrophysiological data. The software is extensively documented through a series of detailed tutorials and actively supported through a user forum and a mailing list. Over the past 8 years we have registered 16,000 distinct users, provided hands on instruction to 1,200 trainees, and the software has been used and cited in ~600 journal papers. Brainstorm includes tools for importing MEG/EEG, intracranial EEG, animal electrophysiology, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data from multiple vendors, extensive interactive features for data preprocessing, selection and visualization, coregistration to volume and surface MRIs and atlases, forward and inverse mapping of cortical current density, time-series and connectivity analysis, and a range of statistical tools. Data can be analyzed through a graphical interface or through scripted pipelines. The current proposal represents a plan to extend Brainstorm in a manner that leverages the unique features of our software and addresses important needs for large-scale data analysis. In this project we will continue to extend and support our software through the following three specific aims: (i) we will harness recent developments in distributed and shared data and high performance computing resources, together with standardization of data organization, to facilitate large-scale, reproducible analysis of electrophysiological data. (ii) We will also address the need for improved modeling resulting from the increasing use of both invasive recordings and direct brain stimulation through development of new modeling software for accurate computation of the intracranial electromagnetic fields produced by brain stimulation and neuronal activation. (iii) Finally, we will continue to add new functionality and to support the software through in-person training, online forums, documentation and other resources. Project Narrative Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) are absolutely non-invasive brain imaging tools, which provide information on the spatial distribution and precise temporal orchestration of human brain activity. In addition to basic neuroscience research, MEG and EEG can be also used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language.

"Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification Project Abstract Motivation: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 500 million people. Children commonly develop CKD from urinary obstructive diseases and nephrotoxic therapies, and then suffer severe growth failure, hyper- tension, cardiovascular risks, and neurocognitive deﬁcits, and eventually end-stage kidney disease. Accurate renal function quantiﬁcation will improve clinical management of hydronephrosis (1 in 100 babies) and dos- ing/selection of chemotherapeutic regimens in oncology patients. Glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR), the biomarker of renal function, is derived from blood or urine tests. These tests only provide global GFR and are limited in accuracy, especially in children, and even more so in children with cancer. MRI offers superb anatomic delineation without ionizing radiation, and is thus ideal for pediatric kidney imaging. However, MRI has not been widely adopted for pediatric renal function evaluation due to lack of reliability and cumbersome workﬂow. These hurdles stem from the fact that the critical components required for global and regional GFR calculation, including high spatiotemporal resolution, plasma ﬂow and arterial input function, are difﬁcult to obtain, and that accurate image segmentation of kidneys (cortex and medulla) is labor intensive. Additionally, although the same contrast agent injection can be used for obstruction evaluation, certain areas of the kidney suffer from signiﬁcant signal loss using standard MRI acquisition techniques due to high contrast agent concentrations. This project addresses these major challenges for automated comprehensive renal function evaluation in children. Approach: The project has three development aims, which are validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable novel free-breathing time-resolved 3D dynamic contrast enhanced MRI that simultaneously provides accurate GFR calculation and renal plasma ﬂow. This is achieved by incorporating self-navigated motion compensation, fast acquisition with parallel imaging and compressed sensing, and phase-contrast ﬂow imaging. The second aim is to develop multiple new image analysis methods to extract GFR and renal plasma ﬂow (RPF) that lever- age novel ﬂow data of Aim 1, as well as automated new machine-learning image processing techniques for the segmentation of kidneys and ultimately global and regional GFR calculation. In Aim 3, we will develop and integrate ultrashort-echo-time techniques to address the MRI signal loss due to T2* effects from high contrast concentration for patients with obstruction, and further incorporate motion compensation and accelerated imag- ing methods to enable time-resolved high-resolution dynamic MRI for contrast washout kinetics analysis in the same MR exam. Aim 4 will determine the performance of these methods in a clinical setting. Signiﬁcance: This work will lead to robust, automated comprehensive pediatric renal MRI for safer and more accurate renal function evaluation in children. The techniques will facilitate widespread application in the com- munity setting and permit robust evaluation of renal function, for both children and adults. Project Narrative Kidney diseases in children often stem from blockages of the urinary tract or toxicity from medications, such as antibiotics or chemotherapies. Kidney function quantiﬁcation is crucial for clinical management of these children.

"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burden of human disability.",Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia,9411095,R01DC011805,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Botulinum Toxins', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communication', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dystonia', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family history of', 'Focal Dystonias', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal muscle structure', 'Larynx', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Occupational', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social isolation', 'Spasm', 'Spastic Dysphonias', 'Speech', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'disability', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'standard care', 'symptom management', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2018,699626,32639530,-0.013992010684703907

"Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disrupted circadian timing has emerged as a serious health and safety issue, yet there are no objective means of easily assessing circadian timing or alignment without performing a highly controlled, multiple-day in- patient study. Altered circadian timing can cause both sleep loss and sleepiness, cause performance errors such as motor vehicle accidents, and impair memory/learning. Thus, despite the obvious need to recognize an individual's circadian phase/alignment, we cannot assess circadian timing clinically or in retrospective studies. Not surprisingly, the first goal of the 2011 NIH Sleep Disorders Research Plan is to identify: ""...metabolic... biomarkers of sleep deficiency and biological timing...and circadian disorders that will facilitate personalized treatments, and clarify the risk associated with untreated sleep and circadian disorders and disturbances."" We are aware that major challenges face biomarker development, including multi-factorial causes of metabolite shifts normally controlled across multiple time-points. Because circadian time is associated with profound metabolic, immune and cardiovascular changes, however, we hypothesize that a biomarker signature for circadian phase derived from -omic markers can be obtained from a single blood sample. We therefore propose to utilize the analytical and bioinformatics platforms and experience in population-level metabolomics studies in the PIs lab to study banked plasma samples from the well-characterized individuals in six tightly controlled circadian rhythm studies run by the four co-investigators.The Aims are:  Aim 1: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and t cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics-  based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples drawn from three constant routine protocols Aim 2: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and to cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples  drawn from four forced desynchrony protocols  Aim 3: To systematically evaluate the validated profiles from Aims 1 and 2 and their mathematical  similarities and differences so as to improve accuracy and precision of the biomarkers  Aim 4: To test the markers identified above under poorly controlled real world applications Identification of biomarker panels will impact multiple aspects of science and health: (i) contribute to clinical recognition and treatment on circadian disorders; (ii) advance personalized medicine through individualized treatment timing to enhance efficacy/reduce side effects of medications (e.g., chemotherapy); (iii) creating epidemiologic tools to relate circadian with disease risk; and aiding development of other disease biomarkers, and; (iv) contribute to research on circadian biology and its implications for human health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to identify blood-based markers that can inform a clinician or researcher about an individual's internal biological clock. At the broad levels of society and public health research, the work has the potential direct benefit of identifying individuals with ""off-set"" clocks (enabling diagnosis and potential therapy), increasing accuracy and precision of studies of blood lipids, facilitating understanding of certain sleep disorders, increasing understanding of the role of biological clocks in chronic disease processes (e.g., cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease), and potentially improving the administration of certain pharmaceuticals, eg, chemotherapy agents.","Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting",9457491,R01HL132556,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Clocks', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Disease', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Drowsiness', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Memory impairment', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Strigiformes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker identification', 'biomarker panel', 'blood lipid', 'blood-based biomarker', 'chemotherapy', 'combinatorial', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'human population study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'men', 'metabolomics', 'personalized medicine', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'real world application', 'tool', 'vehicular accident']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2018,863172,327644200,0.007310376192513312
"Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD Overall Summary The overarching goal of the proposed center is to leverage molecular and circuit biomarkers to advance the understanding of mechanisms and personalized treatment of topiramate treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder comorbid with PTSD. We propose an integrative translational focus on alterations in excitatory and inhibitory signaling, focusing on GABA and glutamate and related circuitry, to model the neurobiology of PTSD comorbid with PTSD and the mitigating effects of topiramate. We will characterize excitatory and inhibitory molecular markers in an animal model of AUD comorbid with PTSD, utilizing genomic markers in the brain and plasma markers in rodents. In clinical trial participants we will characterize excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signaling by ascertaining plasma markers, GRIK 1 genotype and neural circuit markers utilizing TMS evoked potentials in EEG, task-based functional MRI and MR spectroscopy. This goal will be achieved through the activities of three research projects supported by two research cores, the administrative core and the Scientific Advisory Board (Figure1). In Project 1 lead by Silvia Fossati Ph.D. and Jorge Manzanares Robles Ph.D. we will study the behavioral and molecular effects of two doses of topiramate vs. vehicle in animal models of AUD alone, PTSD alone and AUD+PTSD. In Project 2 lead by Michael Bogenschutz M.D. and Joshua Lee M.D. we will study the behavioral, genetic and plasma biomarker effects of topiramate vs. placebo in 150 participants with co-occurring AUD and PTSD. In project 3 lead by Amit Etkin M.D., Ph.D. and Charles R. Marmar M.D. we will ascertain multi-modal imaging markers including task based fMRI, TMS evoked potentials in EEG and MRS. Imaging markers will be used to characterize excitatory and inhibitory circuits in Project 2 clinical trial participants with AUD+PTSD to determine predictors and mechanisms of topiramate vs. placebo treatment outcomes. Plasma biomarkers in Project 2 will be related to the same or homologous plasma biomarkers in Project 1. Circuit markers from Project 3 will be related to genomic markers in the same or homologous brain regions in Project 1. The Biofluids Biomarker Core (BBC) lead by Dr. Fossati will support collection of plasma biomarkers (GABA, glutamate, HPA axis, neuropeptides, neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress) in animals in Project 1 and clinical trial participants in Project 2. The Analytics and Biostatistics Core (ABC) lead by Eugene Laska Ph.D. and Carole Segal Ph.D. will support experimental design, formulation of hypothesis, power calculations, and data integrity, management and analysis for Project 1, 2 and 3, implementing advanced statistical models for individualized prediction of response to topiramate in Project 1 and Project 2. Overall Narrative We aim to advance personalized topiramate treatment for comorbid AUD and PTSD by focusing on network excitatory and inhibitory imbalances underlying heightened negative emotions and impairments in executive function and emotion regulation. Excitatory and inhibitory targets will be assessed with brain, plasma and circuit markers, where possible harmonizing the approach for optimizing discovery of mechanisms and prediction of topiramate treatment in animal models and in clinical trial participants. We will achieve this aim with a center driven approach to discovery with three integrative design elements and four cross-project center aims, creating translational bridges among animal model, clinical trial and imaging studies.",Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD,9608495,P01AA027057,"['Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Data Analytics', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Equilibrium', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Formulation', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Placebos', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol comorbidity', 'alcohol cue', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'design', 'drinking', 'dual diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'genomic biomarker', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'response', 'source localization', 'topiramate', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIAAA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,P01,2018,1202962,329565273,-0.002541912712668321
"Testing the Predictive Power of Structural Neuroimaging in the Estimation of Individuals' Reading and Attentional Abilities PROJECT SUMMARY  Establishing the incremental predictive validity of neuroimaging is a critical prerequisite for this technology's clinical or educational use outside of medical settings. If specific, well-validated neuroimaging tools provide little to no information above that of clinical interview or neuropsychological assessment, the use and funding of those tools should be more critically evaluated against other methods or funding priorities. If neuroimaging demonstrates unique predictive power for assessment or prediction purposes, however, it may aid in the identification of concerning developmental trajectories, the provision of early intervention, or the prediction of individuals' response to specific interventions. Preliminary data from the applicant's laboratory has demonstrated unique contributions of structural neuroimaging to individual differences in reading and attention using confirmatory structural equation modeling, but these questions have yet to be addressed using a data- driven feature-reduction approach that considers numerous types of demographic, behavioral, and brain- derived measures. This proposal focuses explicitly on structural neuroimaging as it is more easily and more consistently obtained than functional imaging in clinical and research environments, and recent findings indicate that it may even be more highly predictive of behavior than functional imaging. In light of these considerations, this proposal will utilize supervised machine learning to assess the incremental validity of structural neuroimaging above and beyond that of traditional psychological assessment.  The goals are this project are to (1) develop and evaluate demographic- and behavior-based predictive models of individuals' reading, inattention, and hyperactivity/impulsivity, (2) replicate and then add neuroanatomical features to these models in order to test structural neuroimaging's incremental predictive validity, and (3) test these models' specificity and discriminant validity for measuring the intended constructs. The long-term goal of this proposal is thus to expand upon the applicant's background in individual difference analyses by developing skills in machine learning so that the incremental validity of multiple neuroimaging modalities can eventually be evaluated. The eventual development of a sufficiently validated predictive model could constitute a behavioral and/or brain-based signature that could serve, along with contextual and functional considerations, as a quantifiable alternative to clinically-based diagnoses. These methods are but first steps toward this distant but worthwhile goal. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Despite decades of studies clarifying the cognitive and neurophysiological predictors of reading and attentional abilities, we're only marginally closer to a more meaningful science of individual prediction. The proposed study will utilize machine learning techniques to test the predictive power of structural neuroimaging above and beyond that of traditional psychological assessment. Beyond the potential for improved prediction of individuals' reading and attentional abilities, the models developed can be easily improved upon using new and preexisting data, thereby moving our field closer to an individualized science of performance- and brain-based markers that can improve early risk identification and evaluate intervention targets.",Testing the Predictive Power of Structural Neuroimaging in the Estimation of Individuals' Reading and Attentional Abilities,9327290,F31HD091967,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Alcohols', 'Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Distant', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neuropsychology', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'demographics', 'falls', 'improved', 'inattention', 'insight', 'mathematical ability', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'phonological awareness', 'predictive modeling', 'processing speed', 'psychologic', 'reading ability', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'tractography']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,F31,2017,35797,492483,-0.0008701398135189864
"Multimodal Neuroimaging Approaches to Modeling Manganese Toxicity Project Summary/Abstract Manganese (Mn) is a known neurotoxin that tens of thousands of workers are exposed to daily, but it is unknown if the current safety guidelines are appropriately strong or too weak to protect them. In an ideal world knowledge of the exposure history of an individual should allow to predict specific risks for health effects. To monitor the effect of Mn welding fumes on workers, the medical imaging techniques Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS) are used to non-invasively image the structure, function, and neurochemistry in the human brain. However, currently studies are not making adequate strides in connecting Mn exposure to changes in MRI or MRS. Studies are only correlating Mn exposure to imaging parameters without taking into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the metal or the individual exposure history, thus lacking the ability to interpret individual data. The broad objective of this project is to fill this crucial gap by creating and validating mathematical models that take into account imaging data, pharmacokinetic properties of Mn and the individual exposure to Mn to predict individual effects of toxicity. Our group runs an ongoing, longitudinal neuroimaging study on local welders and matched controls. Thus we will have abundant and longitudinal data on brain MRI (e.g. T1 maps to assess the brain Mn burden), MRS data on several neurochemicals including GABA, data from personal air sampling and work history questionnaires, neurological and neuropsychological test results, and other biomarkers (toe nails, blood) at our disposal for modeling. The purpose of the current project is to assess and describe how knowledge on exposure and pharmacokinetic properties of Mn enables the interpretation of imaging data as quantitative brain Mn deposition, and how brain-region specific Mn deposition affects neurochemistry in other regions of the brain from where it is deposited. Aim 1 seeks to use MRI structural imaging and known pharmacokinetic properties of Mn to create a mathematical model that can determine the amount of Mn deposition in specific regions of the brain. Aim 2 investigates how the amount, the duration, and the location of Mn deposition in the brain affects neurochemistry. The results of this study will be a first step towards monitoring of individual risks from Mn toxicity by providing the necessary tools to translate exposure information to changes in the brain and consequent health symptoms. Importantly, a better interpretation of individual imaging data will also inform safety guidelines for the individual worker. Project Narrative Manganese (Mn) toxicity leads to disruptive symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease but has no known treatment or cure. Therefore, the prevention, rather than the treatment, of these toxic effects is the first priority for welders, smelters, and other workers exposed to Mn. The goal of this research is to create mathematical models that can predict measureable health consequences from manganese exposure using medical imaging and individual exposure data.",Multimodal Neuroimaging Approaches to Modeling Manganese Toxicity,9328902,F31ES028081,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intoxication', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manganese', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurotoxins', 'Normalcy', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Poison', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Welding', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'air sampling', 'base', 'cohort', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'innovation', 'mathematical model', 'motor impairment', 'multimodality', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'non-invasive imaging', 'outcome prediction', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'screening', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'tool', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,44044,64946317,-0.00026354745626487656
"QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tissue identification and quantification plays a significant role in the study of aging and age-related diseases. For example, the accumulation of fat in the human body and its regional distribution with aging is associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Changes in muscle composition are strongly linked to decline of muscle strength, decreased mobility caused by aging, or musculoskeletal disorders. Especially interesting is analysis of longitudinal changes of morphometric descriptors that is significant for studying the aging process and for the diagnosis and prevention of age-related diseases.  Medical imaging has emerged as a major tool for estimation of body composition mainly due to being non- invasive and producing multi-dimensional information. Nowadays MRI and CT acquisition is a central component of clinical trials. An abundance of imaging data is collected, but this wealth of information has not been utilized to full extent. Therefore research on image analysis techniques for tissue quantification that are reproducible and can be used on large-scale clinical trials is of particular importance.  The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse body composition data from modern MRI and CT imaging. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that qualitative body composition phenotypes on clinical imaging will differentiate individuals who are healthy versus those who are not. The goal of our work is to provide a foundation for image analysis of the abdomen and lower extremities and to study the relationship between body morphological changes and age-related pathologies.  We will build upon recent advances in medical image computing to segment muscle, regional adipose tissue, and bone in clinical CT and MRI scans. We will also develop image registration procedures to achieve intra- and inter-subject correspondence and make efficient use of information provided by multi-modal and multi-temporal imaging data collected in clinical trials (aim 1). After these methods have been developed, we will address the hypothesis that quantitative use of clinical imaging can increase the prognostic accuracy of age-related pathologies (aim2). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age-related diseases such as type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and sarcopenia have become a worldwide epidemic and affect the quality of life of millions. To give a global perspective, roughly 343.8 million people in the world have type-2 diabetes today, and 175 million don't know they have diabetes at all. Metabolic diseases are strongly linked to longitudinal changes in body composition, morphology and function. This project will contribute novel and non-invasive medical image analysis techniques for studying the human body composition and its changes with increasing age to achieve timely prognosis of these pathologies.",QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES,9244841,SC3GM113754,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delaware', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Techniques', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age related', 'biophysical model', 'bone', 'clinical imaging', 'disease diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'morphometry', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'reduced muscle strength', 'sarcopenia', 'statistics', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY,SC3,2017,63883,4139254,-0.007931231969643222

"Intrinsic Cortical Networks and Cognitive Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson's disease (PD) affects 1% of adults over age 65. While traditionally defined by motor symptoms, up to 75% of PD patients will eventually develop dementia making it the leading cause of nursing home placement in this population. Although there is currently no cure for PD, our ability to treat motor symptoms has advanced tremendously since the 1960's based on advances in our understanding of motor symptom neurophysiology. I propose that the treatment and prevention of dementia in PD may also prove possible through advances in our understanding of the neurophysiology of cognitive dysfunction. I will use modern network theory as a theoretical and mathematical framework for this endeavor. My long-term goal is to advance our fundamental understanding of the neurophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in PD to provide empirically testable models, clinically relevant biomarkers, and novel therapeutic targets. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that patterns of cortical functional connectivity critical to normal cognitive function are disruptd by subcortical pathology in PD and that interventions which normalize these patterns will improve cognition. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data presented in this proposal and other previously published work. The research objectives of this proposal are to further our understanding of how cortical connectivity relates to cognitive dysfunction in PD, develop a novel biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in PD based on cortical physiology and to determine whether modulation of cortical connectivity may result in cognitive improvements in PD. We will accomplish the objectives of this proposal through three Specific Aims: 1) Determine whether graph theory measures of functional cortical activity measured with magneto encephalography (MEG) are associated with cognitive dysfunction in PD subjects with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI); 2) Develop a novel state-defining biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in PD based on MEG features through a machine learning approach; and 3) Determine the effects of repetitive trans cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on MEG measures of cortical connectivity and cognitive outcomes in PD-MCI patients. The approach is innovative because it represents the first study to apply graph theory measures to understanding the relationship of cortical physiology and cognitive dysfunction in PD; the first study to apply machine learning approaches to cognitive PD biomarker development; and the first clinical trial or mechanistic study of rTMS in PD-MCI. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in PD and will provide biomarkers and pilot data essential to planning future therapeutic interventions. The training objectives and related research activities of this proposal will provide new skills, manuscripts and pilot data related to advanced MEG analysis, graph theory, biomarker development and rTMS trials necessary to establish my independence in these areas and obtain R01 funding to advance this unique research program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dementia is the leading cause of nursing home placement in Parkinson's disease (PD) yet little is known about the cause(s) of cognitive dysfunction in PD and there are no effective treatments. Our preliminary data and other published studies suggest that abnormalities in brain activity involving networks important for normal thinking and memory may contribute to cognitive dysfunction in PD and may represent a target for treatment. This proposal will identify abnormalities in cortical activity related to cognitive dysfunction in PD usng magneto encephalography and will perform a randomized control trial of frontal repetitive trans cranial magnetic stimulation to determine the therapeutic potential of modulating this brain activity.",Intrinsic Cortical Networks and Cognitive Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease,9315945,K02NS080885,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Cephalic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Elderly', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Manuscripts', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor Cortex', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nursing Homes', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Rest', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker identification', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'effective therapy', 'encephalography', 'graph theory', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'motor symptom', 'network dysfunction', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'physiologic model', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'skills', 'theories', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K02,2017,132354,292134808,0.026167089478867787
"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,9310000,K01ES025442,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward anticipation', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,144298,607172798,0.017463348234548974
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,9279027,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'CCL26 gene', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Standardization', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'illness length', 'immunoreactivity', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'trial design', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2017,156324,507546965,-0.002289415916197279
"Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08) is to provide the candidate with extensive training in 1) machine learning, 2) neuroimaging and 3) developmental psychopathology to conduct independent investigations on the neurobiology that underlies psychopathology that results from childhood maltreatment. There is strong evidence that maltreatment during childhood results in differences across multiple circuits in the developing brain. The extent that affected circuits are involved in psychopathology, however, is unclear. Determining which circuits are involved is necessary to develop interventions that target specific neurobiological systems. The primary aims of the proposed studies are to clarify the involvement of multiple brain features (e.g., structures and functional activations) in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These aims will be accomplished with machine learning. Machine learning is a set of computer-based learning methods in which meaningful theoretical models are derived from empirical data. This proposal builds on the candidate's prior training in clinical psychology, neurobiological models of traumatic stress, and advanced computational methods to develop expertise in: 1) computational methods that include machine learning, genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks, 2) the collection of multi-modal neuroimaging data and 3) the effect of maltreatment on development. Additional professional development training will include grantsmanship, manuscript preparation, and research ethics. To achieve these aims, the candidate has assembled an accomplished mentorship team of experts that span a range of disciplines including developmental psychopathology, computational science, and neuroscience. The training and mentorship will allow the candidate to conduct a series of research studies with two primary aims. The first is to use machine learning to develop a model that integrates structural and task-based functional MRI data to differentiate adolescents with a history of maltreatment from controls. Identifying the features that best differentiate these groups will determine which circuits are implicated in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These models will be constructed with data from an existing high-dimensional database that was obtained by project mentors. The second aim is to obtain pilot data on the association between variations in brain regions and the severity of psychopathology in a sample of maltreated adolescents. When this research is completed, the brain features most affected by maltreatment will be identified and the relation between these brain features and observable symptoms will be quantified. Such knowledge will provide a set of targets for treatment and assist in our classification of maltreatment-related mental illness. The experience and data obtained from this project will position the candidate to pursue future NIH funding to further examine the neurobiology of maltreatment- related psychopathology in adolescence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Child abuse prior to adolescence is associated with marked impairment across the lifespan and is a significant public health concern. There is considerable need to understand how abuse in childhood affects the developing brain and how these changes correspond to observable maladaptive behaviors during adolescence. This project aims to quantify the contribution of brain circuits to maltreatment-related psychopathology in order to improve diagnosis and identify targets for intervention.",Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning,9272937,K08MH107661,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08)', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'computer science', 'conditioned fear', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'maltreatment', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'putamen', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K08,2017,186993,66370127,0.011118837602669095
"Computational modeling of semantic decline in Alzheimer's disease Project Summary To interact, communicate, and navigate the world successfully, people must retrieve relevant information from their semantic memory (memory for facts and general knowledge). Individuals with Alzheimer's disease have difficulty retrieving such knowledge from early in the course of the disease and progressively gets worse as the disease spreads, a process known as semantic decline. This project examines the mechanisms underlying semantic decline in individuals with Alzheimer's disease by developing and applying novel computational tools. The extent to which semantic memory is impaired in individuals with Alzheimer's disease can be probed using behavioral experiments. Individuals with Alzheimer's as well as those at-risk for the disease display a pattern of behavior on these tasks distinct from healthy individuals. Despite decades of research, explanations of these behavioral impairments focus almost exclusively on cognitive mechanisms that may explain a patient's current behavior at a given time point, but without an account of the transition from normal, pre-symptomatic behavior to fully impaired behavior. Existing models fail to explain the mechanisms by which semantic memory and memory retrieval processes degrade over time due to Alzheimer's, limiting our understanding of the development of the disease, as well as hindering our ability for prognosis, early detection measures, and possible interventions. This project will test computational models of how the disease spreads, making specific quantitative predictions about the decline of semantic memory. Additionally, we will develop a novel machine learning method that can be used to map the structure of an individual's semantic memory, creating opportunities for individualized behavioral interventions to improve semantic memory and improve the quality of life for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Project Narrative This project examines the mechanisms underlying decline of semantic memory (memory for knowledge) in individuals with Alzheimer's disease by developing and applying novel computational models. This research will develop methods for testing neurocognitive theories of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases, inform interventions for mitigating decline, and further our understanding of how the disease spreads.",Computational modeling of semantic decline in Alzheimer's disease,9334048,R21AG053467,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Family', 'Free Association', 'Huntington Disease', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Semantic memory', 'Semantics', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Walking', 'Work', 'behavioral impairment', 'computerized tools', 'contagion', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'memory retrieval', 'neurocognitive test', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2017,193393,338121506,-0.05971563969836985
"Pattern Classification Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Traumatic Brain Injury PROJECT SUMMARY Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) affects ~1.5 million persons annually in the United States with fifteen to 30% of patients suffering long-term disability after injury. We remain in the early phase of understanding this disease and one of the greatest barriers to studying the disease and developing appropriate therapy is the difficulty in diagnosis and outcome prediction. Generally, the diagnosis of MTBI relies on using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), a 15-point gross measurement of eye-opening, motor and verbal response. The National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) workshop in 2014 indicated that use of GCS score as a single classifier for TBI is insufficient and proposed that neuroimaging play a larger role towards the development of objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction. We have specific experience in studying novel MRI techniques that show much promise in evaluating MTBI patients. The goal of the current proposal is to bring these novel MRI techniques to clinical use. We propose to combine information from objective MR imaging features with clinical information to learn the patterns that can best distinguish patients from controls and predict long-term outcome using machine learning. We will validate our tool using a separate subject cohort. Such a tool would be an extremely powerful clinical tool to identify at-risk patients for early intervention. Additionally, this research will identify the most clinically relevant MR metrics, thereby pointing the way to novel therapeutic pathways. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is a major public health problem for which there is a lack of evidence-based, quantitative and objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction.

"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research. We develop new knowledge and a novel tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding volunteers in innovative neuroscience research, to ensure ethical participation, enhance trust in science, and accelerate discovery.",Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain,9419223,R01MH114856,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell model', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Human Volunteers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personhood', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'brain research', 'clinical care', 'decision research', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'insight', 'member', 'neuroethics', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'programs', 'screening', 'sound', 'standard measure', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'volunteer']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,223908,560644462,0.024940801571904783
"A high-throughput imaging and classification system for fruit flies PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT In this Phase I SBIR application, FlySorter proposes to development a high throughput imaging and classification system to aid research with fruit flies, a widely-used model organism relevant to both basic science as well as studies in human health. The use of animal model systems is essential for research in almost all aspects of biology: genetics, development, neuroscience, disease, physiology, and beyond. The fruit fly – Drosophila melanogaster – is small and easy to care for, but is complex enough an organism to provide a wealth of information that directly relates to human biology and health. Over 75% of human diseases with a genetic basis (including depression, alcoholism, certain forms of cancer, and many more) are either present or have an analog in Drosophila. Modern genetic tools, such as CRISPR/cas9, allow the creation of transgenic flies that provide the opportunity to study diseases, pathways and systems that don’t exist naturally in Drosophila. With these advances, fruit flies are becoming more frequently subjects for drugs screens. For all the advances in the biological tools and techniques applicable to flies, however, the limiting factor in many experiments is the manual labor involved in a few common tasks: moving flies from vial to vial or other lab equipment; classifying and sorting flies by sex, eye color and other phenotypes; and collecting virgin female flies before they mate so that they can be used in controlled crosses, etc. FlySorter’s patent-pending fly dispensing mechanism can reliably deliver a single organism from a vial containing hundreds of awake flies, and our novel FlyPlate system allows storage of individual flies in custom 96 well plates. FlySorter’s robotic fly handling system, co-developed with the de Bivort Lab at Harvard, is capable of manipulating and transporting those individual flies between vial, 96 well plate, and experimental apparatus. The next piece of the automation puzzle to solve is high throughput imaging and classification. To accomplish this goal, FlySorter will: 1) complete a prototype automated image capture hardware system; 2) adapt state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms for use on Drosophila; and 3) build a module that can physically sort the classified flies into different vials. Once integrated into the existing FlySorter product ecosystem, this imaging and classification module will greatly expand the kinds of experiments and screens that can be automated, allowing for the study of larger populations or a wider variety of flies, reducing the impact of human error, and freeing up valuable time for researchers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fruit flies – Drosophila melanogaster – are one of the most widely used model organisms in biology, for research in genetics, development, neuroscience, disease, and much more. One of the most common tasks in Drosophila labs is sorting flies by various markers and phenotypes using a microscope and paintbrush. FlySorter aims to build an automated system for sorting flies using high resolution digital cameras and modern computer vision algorithms, which will obviate the need for such tedious manual labor.",A high-throughput imaging and classification system for fruit flies,9408980,R43OD023302,"['Air', 'Alcoholism', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Appearance', 'Automation', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Dorsal', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Ecosystem', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Eye Color', 'Female', 'Floor', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Legal patent', 'Lighting', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Microscope', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Neurosciences', 'Obesity', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Partner in relationship', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Pump', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'Sclera', 'Shapes', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Universities', 'Vial device', 'Walking', 'Work', 'analog', 'awake', 'base', 'depression model', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'genetic strain', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'laboratory equipment', 'male', 'meter', 'novel', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'sex', 'tool', 'virtual']",OD,"FLYSORTER, LLC",R43,2017,225000,0,-0.004967876055631762
"Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neurological diseases occur in the absence of neurodegenerative pathology, such as neurotransmission disorders. Deficient neurotransmission is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, deterioration in synaptic function also appears during ageing, accompanied by a decline in cognitive and behavioral function. Synaptic strength and plasticity, important in cognitive functions such as memory, are affected by synaptic activity. However, the regulators of synaptic strength, either activity-dependent or independent, are far from understood. Here, I propose to explore how environmental cues and ageing can affect synaptic morphology in the nematode C. elegans, and how this correlates to synaptic function and activity. In C. elegans, which is an excellent model for neuroscience, synaptic sites can be observed with fluorescent fusion proteins. However, fluorescently labeled synaptic sites are small and faint, and obtaining large number of high-content data poses many experimental limitations. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate regulators of synaptic function through multidimensional morphological profiling of synaptic sites. This work is composed of a mentored and an independent research phase. During the mentored phase, I will develop tools that allow high-throughput quantitative multidimensional profiling of synaptic morphology in large populations of animals. These tools are based on combining microfluidics, automation, and computer vision methods for image analysis, which enable streamlined quantitative morphological characterization of synaptic sites. In addition to this, tools to determine synaptic function in the motor circuit through the quantification of locomotive activity and controlled stimulation of excitatory neurons will be developed to correlate synaptic morphology to function. The mentored phase will also include extensive training in various aspects: technology development, biology and neuroscience, and career development. The scientific environment at the institution of the mentored phase is highly collaborative and provides excellent support in terms of facilities and intellectual opportunities. During the independent research phase, I plan to apply the developed tools during the mentored phase to uncover how environmental cues can affect synaptic function through activity dependent or independent mechanisms. I will also utilize these tools to study synaptic decline during aging, and how exposure to environmental regulators of synaptic function during development can alter synaptic decline during aging. In this way, we will be able to address a biological question unapproachable with conventional methods. This approach is innovative not only because the technology developed will greatly increase the throughput and quality of characterization, but also because it proposes studying the links between form and function in synaptic sites. This project is significant because it will enable streamlined morphological studies in neuroscience, which should lead to uncovering pathways, genes and potential therapies for synaptic function deficiencies due to disease or age-related decline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Defective neurotransmission is the cause of many neurological diseases ranging from depression to autism. Understanding the regulators of synaptic strength can shed light on pathways that play a role in establishing healthy synaptic function, and treatments for neurotransmission-related diseases.",Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization,9303234,R00AG046911,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Descriptor', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institution', 'Ion Channel', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Cleft', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'career development', 'cognitive function', 'excitatory neuron', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'neurotransmitter release', 'neurotransmitter uptake', 'normal aging', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'synaptic function', 'technology development', 'tool']",NIA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R00,2017,249000,32532200,0.008130076317410952
"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.     What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.     What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented.         Protections for Human Subjects:    Acceptable        Vertebrate Animals:    Not applicable        Resource Sharing:    Acceptable. Data management plan is reasonable. Published data will be shared upon request when practically and ethically possible.        Budget and Period of Support:    Recommend as Requested Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms. By isolating the contribution of  different memory systems to learned choice, this project may help to guide future treatment strategies.",CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions,9333297,R01DA038891,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Budgets', 'Choice Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Drug abuse', 'Eating Disorders', 'Employee Strikes', 'Episodic memory', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Female', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Midbrain structure', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Vertebrates', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'data management', 'dopamine system', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'human subject protection', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outreach', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'role model', 'statistics', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'treatment strategy', 'undergraduate student']",NIDA,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,328543,58504236,0.02247620125653631
"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,9275549,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical translation', 'data mining', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,330348,641965656,0.02416399865290204
"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment.

The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burden of human disability.",Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia,9535613,R01DC011805,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Botulinum Toxins', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communication', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dystonia', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family history of', 'Focal Dystonias', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal muscle structure', 'Larynx', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Occupational', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social isolation', 'Spasm', 'Spastic Dysphonias', 'Speech', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'disability', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'standard care', 'symptom management', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2017,365626,32639530,-0.013992010684703907
"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Project Summary:  Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these chal- lenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymor- phisms, whole brain neuroimaging, bioﬂuids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mecha- nisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Speciﬁcally, in Aim 1, we develop efﬁcient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation mod- els to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efﬁciency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-speciﬁc substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic sys- tems through ordinary differential equations with random inﬂections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker proﬁles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efﬁcient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individu- alized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest beneﬁt from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art ana- lytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research com- munity. Project Narrative:  The ultimate goal of neuropsychiatric research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay disease on- set, slow disease progression, and provide effective treatment at each stage of disease. This proposal aims to develop new statistical approaches to integrate complementary sources of information from genomic measures, brain imaging biomarkers, and early clinical signs to characterize disease mechanism, progression, and treatment responses, and thereby inform the design of clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies.",Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures,9308279,R01NS073671,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hazard Models', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'minimal risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,366940,558628098,-0.016514050361938964
"Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD Abstract Up to 80% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) will suffer from cognitive symptoms, including impaired attention, planning, reasoning and working memory as well as hallucinations, visuospatial dysfunction, and delusions. These impairments lead to mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PDD) in PD. Cognitive symptoms of PD are associated with enormous cost to our society. There are no clear biomarkers and few effective treatments for PD-MCI/PDD. Because risk for PD increases dramatically with age, this problem will surge as our population grows older. The mechanisms contributing to PD-MCI/PDD are unknown. Our group has found that low-frequency (1-8 Hz; or delta/theta bands) brain rhythms might be helpful in diagnosing cognitive dysfunction in PD. This delta/theta activity originates from areas of medial frontal cortex such as the anterior cingulate, and is detectable by mid-frontal scalp EEG electrodes. We have found that mid-frontal delta/theta brain rhythms are engaged when healthy individuals detect novelty, errors, and conflict, or make decisions. These rhythms are attenuated in PD patients. Our working model is that PD patients manifest diverse neuronal and network deficits that impair mid-frontal delta/theta activity, leading to failures in engaging cognitive control. These abnormalities contribute to PD-MCI and PDD. In this proposal we combine `big-data' machine learning tools, intraoperative neurophysiology in humans, and new brain-stimulation paradigms to investigate the role of mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms in PD. We will test the overall hypothesis that mid-frontal delta/theta impairments are a mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in PD. In Aim 1 we will determine if mid-frontal delta/theta activity predicts PD-MCI/PDD. In Aim 2 we will use unique intraoperative recordings to determine how delta/theta activity within medial frontal cortex influences neurons in the subthalamic nucleus, a key site of functional convergence that is targeted by current deep-brain stimulation for PD. Notably, the subthalamic nucleus is a compact structure that receives highly overlapping input from cognitive and motor cortical regions, making it likely that our recordings will capture cognitive processing within this nucleus. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine if subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation at delta/theta frequencies improves cognitive control in PD patients. Because these experiments involve recordings across several PD patient populations (Aim 1), from single subthalamic neurons (Aim 2), and brain stimulation (Aim 3), each of these aims will provide independent mechanistic insight into cognitive dysfunction in PD. PD is a complex disease, but if cortical EEG abnormalities are a consistent theme it might inspire new diagnostic tools or new brain-stimulation therapies for cognitive dysfunction in PD. Results from this proposal could also be important for other neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease.     Public Health Relevance Cognitive symptoms of Parkinson's disease are an enormous public health problem. Here, we will ana- lyze brain rhythms that are involved in cognitive processing and also dysfunctional in Parkinson's dis- ease. We will use these brain rhythms to guide novel brain stimulation that has the potential to treat dementia and cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease.  ",Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD,9445918,R01NS100849,"['Acetylcholine', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alpha Rhythm', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reaction Time', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theta Rhythm', 'Time', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'alpha synuclein', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'implantation', 'improved', 'insight', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'motor symptom', 'neuronal patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2017,403257,193405667,0.03445585380935535
"Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and demographic data to predict future cognitive decline toward dementia ABSTRACT The “preclinical” phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by abnormal levels of brain amyloid accumulation in the absence of major symptoms, can last decades, and potentially holds the key to successful therapeutic strategies. Today there is an urgent need for quantitative biomarkers and genetic tests that can predict clinical progression at the individual level. This project will develop cutting edge machine learning algorithms that will mine high dimensional, multi-modal, and longitudinal data to derive models that yield individual-level clinical predictions in the context of dementia. The developed prognostic models will specifically utilize ubiquitous and affordable data types: structural brain MRI scans, saliva or blood-derived genome-wide sequence data, and demographic variables (age, education, and sex). Prior research has demonstrated that all these variables are strongly associated with clinical decline to dementia, however to date we have no model that can harvest all the predictive information embedded in these high dimensional data. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used to compute clinical predictions from high- dimensional biomedical data such as clinical scans. Yet, most prior ML methods were developed for applications where the ``prediction’’ task was about concurrent condition (e.g., discriminate cases and controls); and established risk factors (e.g., age), multiple modalities (e.g., genotype and images) and longitudinal data were not fully exploited. This application’s core innovation will be to develop rigorous, flexible, and practical ML methods that can fully exploit multi-modal, longitudinal, and high- dimensional biomedical data to compute prognostic clinical predictions. The proposed project will build on the PI’s strong background in computational modeling and analysis of large-scale biomedical data. We will employ an innovative Bayesian ML framework that offers the flexibility to handle and exploit real-life longitudinal and multi-modal data. We hypothesize that the developed models will be more useful than alternative benchmarks for identifying preclinical individuals who are at heightened risk of imminent clinical decline. We will use a statistically rigorous approach for discovery, cross-validation, and benchmarking the developed tools. This project will yield freely distributed, documented, and validated software and models for predicting future clinical progression based on whole-genome, longitudinal structural MRI and demographic data. We believe the algorithms and software we develop will yield invaluable tools for stratifying preclinical AD subjects in drug trials, optimizing future therapies, and minimizing the risk of adverse effects. NARRATIVE Emerging technologies allow us to identify clinically healthy subjects harboring Alzheimer’s pathology. While many of these preclinical individuals progress to dementia, sometimes quite quickly, others remain asymptomatic for decades. The proposed project will develop sophisticated data mining algorithms to derive models that can predict future clinical decline based on ubiquitous, easy- to-collect, and affordable data modalities: brain MRI scans, saliva or blood- derived whole-genome sequences, and clinical and demographic variables.","Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and demographic data to predict future cognitive decline toward dementia",9307096,R01AG053949,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anatomy', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Harvest', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Prevention approach', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Saliva', 'Scanning', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Site', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'aging brain', 'base', 'case control', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive testing', 'data mining', 'flexibility', 'functional disability', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'risk minimization', 'sex', 'software development', 'sound', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NIA,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,407500,91477866,-0.0601268231723829
"4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging allows safe, non-invasive measurement of brain structures and functions and their changes over time. This has led to many longitudinal studies to discover imaging biomarkers for better prediction of brain disorders. However, the associated longitudinal changes are often tiny within a short follow-up time, and are thus difficult to detect by conventional methods since the measurement errors could be larger than the actual changes. Also, with the significant increase of data with longitudinal follow-ups, it becomes challenging to capture a small set of effective imaging biomarkers from large data for accurate disease prediction. This issue becomes even more critical when there is missing data in the longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. The goal of this renewal project is to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. These tools wil allow elucidating subtle abnormal changes that would be otherwise left undetected with existing tools. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will create a novel multi-atlas guided 4D brain labelling method for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject. All longitudinal images of each subject will be first aligned by a novel groupwise 4D registration algorithm that can more accurately estimate longitudinal deformations. Then, these aligned longitudinal images can be further registered with multiple atlases guided by a graph that locally connects all (subject and atlas) images, thus obtaining more accurate/consistent registration and ROI labeling for the longitudinal images of same subject. In Aim 2, we will further create a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model to effectively integrate serial imaging and non-imaging biomarkers for early diagnosis and prediction of brain status. Also, to further extract effective biomarkers, a new machine learning technique, called deep learning, will be adapted to learn high-level features for helping prediction with a novel temporally-constrained group sparse learning method, which is able to predict clinical scores consistently for future time-points. Finally, in Aim 3, we will create nove methods to deal with missing data in longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. In particular, we will first develop several data completion methods (including matrix completion) to complete the missing data. Then, instead of designing a single predictor that may be limited, we will design multiple diverse predictors (by multi-task learning) for ensemble prediction, thus significantly increasing the overall prediction performance. Also, considering that the individual's future images are not available at early time-points, to improve the clinical utility of the proposed methods, we will apply our models to various cases with different numbers of longitudinal images and then further train them jointly to achieve the overall best performance. Note that the performance of all proposed methods will be evaluated in this project for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) study, although they are also applicable to studies of other brain disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel multi-atlases guided 4D brain labelling framework for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across the longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject by harnessing the manifold of anatomical variation of 4D image and the atlases, 2) a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model that will automatically learn the relevant information from imaging and non-imaging data of past time-points to predict future status of brain, and 3) novel methods for missing data completion and then multiple diverse predictors for ensemble prediction. We will also make these methods practical for clinical diagnostics setting. Finally, we will package all our methods into a softwar tool and release it publicly, as we have done before. The methods that we will develop can find their applications not only in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that will be used as example in this project, but also in other fields such as longitudinal monitoring of other neurological diseases (i.e., schizophrenia) and measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain.",4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease,9213309,R01EB008374,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Schizophrenia', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'serial imaging', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,451650,511185245,-0.017135297644644505
"Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by  Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging can provide safe, non-invasive, and whole-brain measurements for large clinical and research studies of brain disorders. However, many disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alterations, which are often difficult to tease out due to limited image quality afforded by the popular 3T MRI scanners (with 20,000+ units available worldwide). Although 7T MRI scanners provide better image quality, these ultrahigh field scanners are not widely available (with only 40+ units available worldwide) and are also not used clinically. Thus, tools for reconstructing 7T-like high-quality MRI from 3T MRI scan are highly desirable. A means for achieving this is by learning the relationship between 3T and 7T MRI scans from training samples. This renewal project is dedicated to developing a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels of 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD. Specifically, (Aim 1) to enhance the image quality of 3T MRI, we will develop a novel deep learning architecture to learn a complex multi-layer 3T-to-7T mapping from training subjects, each with coupled 3T and 7T MRI scans. This mapping will then be applied to reconstruct quality-enhanced 7T-like MRI scans from new 3T MRI scans. (Aim 2) For brain structural measurement (e.g., brain atrophies, and hippocampal volume shrinkage), a crucial step is brain tissue segmentation. We will thus develop a robust and accurate random forest tissue segmentation method, which maps 7T label information to 3T scans. The mapping function is trained using tissue labels generated for 7T scans, instead of 3T scans which often have limited image contrast. (Aim 3) To further quantify local atrophies in ROIs or even sub-ROIs (i.e., hippocampal subfields), we will develop a deformable multi-ROI segmentation method by employing (a) random forest to predict deformation from each image location to the target boundary by adaptive integration of multimodal (anatomical, structural & functional connectivity) information and (b) auto-context model to iteratively refine ROI segmentation results. Note that the adaptive integration of multimodal MRI data, especially resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), is critical to the segmentation of sub-ROIs such as hippocampal subfields, since local functional connectivity patterns can help distinguish boundaries between neighboring subfields that often have different cortico-cortical connections. (Aim 4) Finally, by integrating anatomical features from all accurately segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs and also structural & functional connectivity features between those segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs, we can more effectively detect early-stage brain disorders, i.e., the conversion of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD. We will integrate information from different imaging datasets and multiple imaging centers by using our novel multi-task learning approach for jointly learning the respective disease prediction models. Applications. These computational methods will find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormalities associated with various neurological diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia), measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between imaging and clinical scores. Narrative Description of Project The goal of this renewal project is to achieve robust brain measurements from the routine 3T MRI, guided by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI. To this end, we will create a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels from 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new testing subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD.",Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI,9372271,R01EB006733,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Atrophic', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain tissue', 'cerebral atrophy', 'contrast imaging', 'disease diagnosis', 'forest', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'research study', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,481714,511185245,-0.007038311952502387
"Characterizing Alzheimer's Disease with INSPECDS: Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT  It is estimated that Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia will surpass cancer as the leading cause of death by the year 2040. Alzheimer's is the leading cause of dementia, followed by synucleinopathies, including dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), Fronto-temporal dementia and Vascular dementia. Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, biomarkers, and treatment options for Alzheimer's disease, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process. To address this unmet need Advanced Brain Monitoring (ABM) proposes to leverage day and night assessment technologies to create an Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS) to profile Alzheimer's and other dementias. The core components of the INSPECDS platform will be the Alertness and Memory Profiler (AMP), the Sleep Profiler, and integrated machine-learning, classification algorithms, hosted on a secure, cloud-based, infrastructure for automated data processing, analysis, and reporting. The AMP was developed and validated intially for the purpose of detecting the neurocognitive effects of sleep deprivation in adults diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea but has more recently been applied to assess Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The AMP is unique among neurocognitive testing platforms in that it is the only one which integrates advanced, electrophysiological measures (e.g., 24-channel, wireless EEG and ECG) during the performance of computerized neurocognitive tasks and has proven effective in characterizing cognitive decline in Alzheimer's. This advanced capability permits researchers to explore real- time relations between fluctuations in alertness, discrete cognitive functions, and specific neural processes believed to subserve observed performance deficits in Alzheimer's and other dementias. The Sleep Profiler is an FDA-cleared, easily applied, wireless-EEG device that was developed and validated to measure sleep architecture for in-home sleep studies with submental (chin) EMG and wireless accelerometers to monitor head and limb movements to quantify the characteristics of REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD), considered to be a prodromal expression of synucleinopathy. Furthermore, the application of sophisticated, machine- learning, classification algorithms will streamline the processing and analyses of these data to derive statistical probabilities of Alzheimer's and other dementia subtypes. The overarching goal of the current, Direct-to-Phase II, SBIR project is to finalize implementation of a secure, cloud-based infrastructure to compile the data obtained from the AMP and Sleep Profiler, train classification algorithms to discriminate among Alzheimer's and other dementia subtypes, validate diagnostic accuracy, and integrate optimized classifiers within the cloud- based architecture. Once completed, the INSPECDS system will be the first clinical research tool of its kind and find immediate application in both university-based research settings and pharmaceutical industry clinical trials to aid in the endophenotypic stratification of Alzheimer's and other dementias.

"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,9313961,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Controlled Study', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Women&apos', 's Health Nursing', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'motor symptom', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2017,563079,146629556,0.01768316713774747
"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

"Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is estimated that neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia will surpass cancer as the leading cause of death by the year 2040. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, followed by synucleinopathies, such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, biomarkers, and treatment options for these neurodengenerative diseases, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process. To address this unmet need Advanced Brain Monitoring (ABM) proposes to leverage two previously developed technologies to create an Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS). The core components of the INSPECDS platform will be a previously developed Alertness and Memory Profiler (AMP), a recently developed Sleep Profiler, and integrated machine-learning, classification algorithms, hosted on a secure, cloud-based, infrastructure for automated data processing, analysis, and reporting. The AMP was developed and validated during a previous NIH-funded SBIR Phase I/II project for the purpose of detecting the neurocognitive effects of sleep deprivation in adults diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea. The AMP is truly unique among neurocognitive testing platforms in that it is the only one which integrates advanced, electrophysiological measures (e.g., 24-channel, wireless EEG and ECG) during the performance of computerized neurocognitive tasks. This advanced capability permits researchers to explore real-time relations between fluctuations in alertness, discrete cognitive functions, and specific neural processes believed to subserve observed performance deficits. The Sleep Profiler is an FDA-cleared, easily applied, wireless-EEG device that was developed and validated to measure sleep architecture for in-home sleep studies. With integrated measures of submental (chin) EMG and wireless accelerometers to monitor head and limb movements, the Sleep Profiler is an ideal device for quantifying the characteristics of REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD), which is considered to be a prodromal expression of synucleinopathy. Furthermore, the application of sophisticated, machine-learning, classification algorithms will streamline the processing and analyses of these data to derive statistical probabilities of various dementia subtypes. The overarching goal of the current, Direct-to-Phase II, SBIR project is to develop a secure, cloud-based infrastructure to compile the data obtained from the AMP and Sleep Profiler, train classification algorithms to discriminate among dementia subtypes, validate diagnostic accuracy, and integrate optimized classifiers within the cloud-based architecture.

"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9316197,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Compulsive Behavior', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'response', 'reward processing', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2017,749730,68331629,0.013658969907760079
"Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disrupted circadian timing has emerged as a serious health and safety issue, yet there are no objective means of easily assessing circadian timing or alignment without performing a highly controlled, multiple-day in- patient study. Altered circadian timing can cause both sleep loss and sleepiness, cause performance errors such as motor vehicle accidents, and impair memory/learning. Thus, despite the obvious need to recognize an individual's circadian phase/alignment, we cannot assess circadian timing clinically or in retrospective studies. Not surprisingly, the first goal of the 2011 NIH Sleep Disorders Research Plan is to identify: ""...metabolic... biomarkers of sleep deficiency and biological timing...and circadian disorders that will facilitate personalized treatments, and clarify the risk associated with untreated sleep and circadian disorders and disturbances."" We are aware that major challenges face biomarker development, including multi-factorial causes of metabolite shifts normally controlled across multiple time-points. Because circadian time is associated with profound metabolic, immune and cardiovascular changes, however, we hypothesize that a biomarker signature for circadian phase derived from -omic markers can be obtained from a single blood sample. We therefore propose to utilize the analytical and bioinformatics platforms and experience in population-level metabolomics studies in the PIs lab to study banked plasma samples from the well-characterized individuals in six tightly controlled circadian rhythm studies run by the four co-investigators.The Aims are:  Aim 1: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and t cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics-  based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples drawn from three constant routine protocols Aim 2: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and to cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples  drawn from four forced desynchrony protocols  Aim 3: To systematically evaluate the validated profiles from Aims 1 and 2 and their mathematical  similarities and differences so as to improve accuracy and precision of the biomarkers  Aim 4: To test the markers identified above under poorly controlled real world applications Identification of biomarker panels will impact multiple aspects of science and health: (i) contribute to clinical recognition and treatment on circadian disorders; (ii) advance personalized medicine through individualized treatment timing to enhance efficacy/reduce side effects of medications (e.g., chemotherapy); (iii) creating epidemiologic tools to relate circadian with disease risk; and aiding development of other disease biomarkers, and; (iv) contribute to research on circadian biology and its implications for human health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to identify blood-based markers that can inform a clinician or researcher about an individual's internal biological clock. At the broad levels of society and public health research, the work has the potential direct benefit of identifying individuals with ""off-set"" clocks (enabling diagnosis and potential therapy), increasing accuracy and precision of studies of blood lipids, facilitating understanding of certain sleep disorders, increasing understanding of the role of biological clocks in chronic disease processes (e.g., cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease), and potentially improving the administration of certain pharmaceuticals, eg, chemotherapy agents.","Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting",9264015,R01HL132556,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Clocks', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Disease', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Drowsiness', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Memory impairment', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Strigiformes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker identification', 'biomarker panel', 'blood lipid', 'blood-based biomarker', 'chemotherapy', 'combinatorial', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'human population study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'men', 'metabolomics', 'personalized medicine', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'real world application', 'tool', 'vehicular accident']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2017,877276,327644200,0.007310376192513312
"Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this research is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). Currently, more than 28 million Americans have impaired hearing and approximately 75% of these persons are over the age of 55. The prevalence of presbycusis will increase substantially with the aging of the population. To meet the challenges of this most common chronic condition of aging, improved diagnostic methods, treatment approaches, and prevention strategies will be of great importance. To meet these objectives, four research projects are proposed. Project 1 assesses age-related changes in human cochlear and neural function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies. Project 2 examines the impact of metabolic and sensory presbycusis and aging on brain structure and functional networks that support speech recognition. Project 3 identifies genetic variations causing an increased susceptibility to age-related hearing loss using DNA samples from older adults in our study and defines their pathological consequences in human temporal bones. Project 4 studies adult stem cell dependency on the cochlear extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment using animal models of metabolic presbycusis and ECM deficiency, and observations of cochlear tissues from human temporal bones. A central goal is to relate changes observed in animal models of metabolic presbycusis to declines in hearing in older humans. In parallel with this goal, results from the large battery of tests obtained from participants in our longitudinal study (Human Subjects Core) will be analyzed to further define and validate phenotypes of age-related hearing loss. Thus, four interrelated research projects, supported by large numbers of well-characterized human subjects and a detailed database of cross-sectional and longitudinal data, form a cohesive program that addresses fundamental questions on human presbycusis. The Clinical Research Center is unique in several respects, including its 25-year longitudinal study of  hearing in older persons, the diversity of basic, translational, and clinical approaches, and its focus on a disorder that contributes to poor communication abilities and reduced quality of life for millions of older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Clinical Research Center leverages the multidisciplinary and wide-ranging expertise in each project, and the wealth of information available in the human subject database, to generate new knowledge on the high prevalence public health problem of age-related hearing loss. Our goals are to reduce its prevalence, slow its progression, and develop new prevention, diagnostic, and treatments strategies to improve communication and quality of life of older adults.      Subproject 1  Defining Phenotypes of Age-Related Hearing Loss  Lead Investigator: Judy R. Dubno, Ph.D.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complex genetic and environmental factors affecting human hearing over the lifespan contribute to a large variation in audiometric profiles and suprathreshold measures of auditory function. As a result, determining mechanisms of age-related hearing loss in older adults is challenging because genetic, age, noise history, injury, disease, medication, diet, and other factors can work independently and jointly to alter human auditory function. Although morphologic findings from older humans are limited to postmortem data, experimental procedures with animals of known heredity can disrupt specific cochlear systems, model certain pathologic conditions, and introduce or minimize environmental exposures, while measuring subsequent changes in auditory function. Consistent with results from animal models linking audiometric profiles to specific cochlear pathologies, such as metabolic or sensory loss, audiograms from the Clinical Research Center's human subject database (Core B) were classified into four audiometric phenotypes, which provided a means to characterize the pathophysiology of hearing loss in older humans. Audiometric phenotypes determined using supervised machine learning classifiers were consistent with expected demographic and noise history patterns that segregate with patterns of hearing loss. Project 1 will refine and further validate these phenotyping methods using suprathreshold measures of cochlear and neural function beyond the audiogram that characterize metabolic and sensory presbyacusis, and the additive effects of morphologic and functional neural loss. To meet this goal Aim 1.1 tests the hypothesis that older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis differ in cochlear nonlinearities and lower frequency suprathreshold auditory function. Aim 1.2 tests the hypothesis that changes in auditory nerve activity result in unique and additive effects in older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis. Thus, Project 1 will assess age- related changes in auditory function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies and link findings to Project 2, focused on central auditory and cortical changes, and to translational Projects 3 and 4, which will determine the genetic and cellular mechanisms of age-related hearing loss using humans and human tissue. With these approaches, morphologic and physiologic changes characterizing metabolic, sensory, and neural presbyacusis provide a framework for assessing and interpreting age-related changes in human auditory function.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Knowledge of the variations in pathophysiology underlying human age-related hearing loss may dictate different diagnostic test batteries, hearing-aid fitting  algorithms, auditory-training regimens, and recommendations for communication strategies. This new information will lead to better diagnosis and treatments for this high-prevalence public health concern, and improved communication and quality of life for millions of older adults.",Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis,9205503,P50DC000422,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory', 'Autopsy', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heredity', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical shape', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Presbycusis', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Temporal bone structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adult stem cell', 'age related', 'cohesion', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'human subject', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'speech recognition', 'support network', 'treatment strategy']",NIDCD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,P50,2017,2137301,136810522,0.0052584257644916685

"Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits Project Summary  Of the diverse features of the mammalian motor repertoire, skilled limb movements have become some of the more impressive and indispensable ways of interacting with the environment. The susceptibility of these movements to neurodegenerative disease and injury underscores the need for a better understanding of how neural circuits orchestrate these dexterous behaviors. This goal demands sophisticated experimental scrutiny at both neural and behavioral levels, and while the emergence of genetic tools for monitoring and manipulating neural circuits in mice has been transformative, the development of motor behavioral assays has not kept pace. Typically, a single behavioral test is applied to the question at hand, precluding a more comprehensive description of why relevant neural circuits have evolved their particular anatomical and functional attributes. Moreover, in the study of limb motor control, primate-inspired behavioral paradigms tend to be applied to the mouse by default, risking neglect of a more complete and naturalistic account of motor circuit function.  Ethology emphasizes an unbiased study of behavior under natural conditions. This proposal describes an ethological approach for the quantification and categorization of skilled limb movements in mice, enabling a depth and breadth of behavioral analysis that more closely aligns with the complexity of the underlying neural circuits. Several complementary approaches for unbiased behavioral quantification of mouse limb movements in enriched environments will be developed in parallel: a set of optical techniques enabling automated three- dimensional reconstruction of limb and digit posture and trajectory; and an approach that leverages advances in the miniaturization of motion sensors for camera-free limb tracking that can be integrated seamlessly with neural and electromyography (EMG) recordings. Through iterative refinement, this multifaceted strategy should highlight the strengths and mitigate potential drawbacks of each tracking method, providing a suite of complementary quantitative tools. Kinematic, kinetic, EMG and neural data collected across diverse behavioral contexts will be used to guide machine learning-based classification of natural structure in limb movements and in their underlying neural circuits. As a proving ground for how these naturalistic behavioral analyses can be integrated with the genetic dissection of neural circuit function, a set of molecularly defined motor circuits will be probed using novel optogenetic tools that permit selective inhibition at defined axon collateral terminals. This combination of projection specific genetic perturbation and ethologically driven behavioral analyses will provide a powerful lens through which to view the fine-grained functional organization of mammalian motor circuits. More generally, this merging of molecular and systems neuroscience approaches will offer a novel way to explore and compare fine motor control across species, equipping the field with a more comprehensive and standardized approach to study skilled behavior, and helping lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of behavioral deficits associated with neural circuit dysfunction. Project Narrative Skilled limb movements play a central role in mammalian behavior, from the seemingly mundane to the astoundingly athletic – yet little is known about how specific neural circuits orchestrate limb motor output to ensure precision and dexterity. To identify the neural basis of skilled behaviors, a more comprehensive and quantitative understanding of natural limb movements in mice is needed to take better advantage of the powerful genetic accessibility of this model system. The ability to track and define these skilled, natural movements will enable a more sensitive and empirical exploration of the neural control of behavior, and should lay the groundwork for more effective diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits caused by disease or injury.",Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits,9351131,DP2NS105555,"['Anatomy', 'Athletic', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Electromyography', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethology', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Injury', 'Kinetics', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Predisposition', 'Primates', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral study', 'dexterity', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'kinematics', 'lens', 'limb movement', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,DP2,2017,2910000,65771974,0.007219107500773574
"Heterogeneity of Multi-modal Imaging Signatures of Aging, MCI, Alzheimer's disease via Pattern Analysis Abstract Alzheimer's Disease (AD), as well as its prodromal stages, poses a significant burden to the community and health care system. Several other pathologic processes often co-exist with AD pathology. Characterizing the multi-faceted aspects of brain changes present in aging and (prodromal) AD not only provides insights into the underlying pathophysiological processes, such as amyloid deposition, small vessel ischemic disease(SVID), and neurodegeneration or functional change, but also leads to biomarkers of these pathologic processes. In this proposal, we aim to capture the heterogeneity of various imaging patterns that reflect pathologic processes occurring with aging and prodromal AD, by applying state of the art heterogeneity analysis machine learning methods recently developed in our laboratory to multi-faceted imaging data (structural MRI, resting state functional MRI, amyloid imaging). These methods allow us to quantify the different ways/patterns in which an individual can fall off the normative brain aging trajectories. Our goal is to arrive at a new “Imaging-based coordinate SysTem for AGing and NeurodeGenerative diseases”(iSTAGING), each dimension of which will reflect a different pattern of brain alterations, hence capturing the underlying neuroanatomical, neurofunctional and neuropathological heterogeneity in quantifiable and replicable metrics. Moreover, we aim to link these neuroimaging phenotypes with neurocognitive phenotypes, as well as with progression from cognitively normal aging to MCI and to dementia. This will allow us to place each individual into a new dimensional brain coordinate system of aging and map his/her trajectory, as well to determine predictive indices emanating from multi-parametric imaging data. Prior to achieving these aims, we will strengthen and apply various imaging harmonization methods, which are critical in ensuring that data across studies and scanners can be integrated in a constructive way. In particular, Aim1 will apply inter-site imaging harmonization methods, and hence develop a platform that will allow us to integrate multi-parametric imaging datasets from more than 10,000 participants to several studies spanning ages 45 to 89; we will therefore form a large multi-modal imaging database capturing the heterogeneity of normal brain aging and prodromal AD. Aim 2 will use machine learning methods to integrate spatial patterns of brain atrophy, SVID, Aβ deposition and functional connectivity in this population, and will derive normative brain aging curves. Aim 3 will use state of the art semi-supervised learning methods to disentangle the heterogeneity of imaging patterns distinguishing resilient from advanced brain aging: this will lead to the dimensional system (iSTAGING) capturing the diverse dimensions/patterns of advanced (non-resilient) age-related brain change relative to resilient brain aging, which reflect underlying neuropathological processes. Aim 4 will relate iSTAGING coordinates and longitudinal trajectories to cognition, risk factors, and clinical progression from normal cognition to MCI to dementia, in order to further elucidate the clinical correlates of these neuroimaging dimensions. Project narrative This proposal pools imaging data from 11 different studies, with a total of more than 10,000 individuals of ages 45 to 95, aiming to obtain a comprehensive characterization of brain aging. State of the art imaging harmonization, pattern analysis and machine learning methods will be used to derive normative brain aging curves, and to characterize the heterogeneity of deviations from these curves in people with resilient and accelerated brain aging. Moreover, we aim to relate these imaging patterns to cognitive performance. We will eventually derive and “Imaging-based coordinate SysTem for AGing and NeurodeGenerative diseases”(iSTAGING), allowing us to place any individual's scans into a quantitative measurement system and plot his/her trajectories over time.","Heterogeneity of Multi-modal Imaging Signatures of Aging, MCI, Alzheimer's disease via Pattern Analysis",9211062,RF1AG054409,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Anatomy', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'abeta deposition', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'amyloid imaging', 'base', 'care systems', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive performance', 'community burden', 'effective therapy', 'falls', 'frontier', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'normal aging', 'pathological aging', 'predictive marker', 'quantitative imaging', 'resilience', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,RF1,2017,3791182,593605914,-0.049458580106430394
"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We will use a novel statistical approach to develop and validate the models.",Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler,9052846,R01NS082304,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anterior', 'Anterior Horn Cells', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Natural History', 'Neuraxis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Riluzole', 'Spinal', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interest', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'screening', 'spinal tract', 'treatment response', 'treatment trial']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,1,641965656,-0.00038123332877853584
"Neurocognitive Mechanisms of the Executive Control of Memory and Emotion ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Executive control processes are needed to regulate the balance between attending to events in one's external environment and attending to introspective processing, including the reliving of past memories and the associated emotions that they evoke. The proposed studies aim to clarify the neural mechanisms that support these specific forms of cognition and that mediate the ability to flexibly shift attentional resources between them. We are specifically interested in evaluating whether the retrieval of a negatively-valenced autobiographical episode will induce an internally-oriented brain state that may obstructively linger when changing task demands require a shift towards prioritizing the processing of incoming sensory stimuli. Our interests are motivated by recent findings in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), who exhibit a tendency to ruminate about negative past events, difficulty disengaging from these ruminations, and an associated neural system abnormality resulting in an inability to effectively mobilize executive control systems to suppress the internally-oriented default mode network (DMN). This may in turn exert a cost on the performance of goal-directed cognitive operations that depend on monitoring external stimuli and limiting distraction. However, before we can properly characterize these processes in MDD, it is essential that we better understand how the healthy brain enacts executive control to efficiently shift between internally- and externally-focused states, especially in the context of negative affect.  To pursue these goals, we have designed an fMRI task paradigm in which participants are cued to vividly recall a negatively-valenced or neutral autobiographical memory and shortly thereafter are tasked with performing an externally-oriented visual working memory task. Our proposed analyses will monitor brain activity, functional connectivity, and behavior as participants shift back and forth between these two very distinct tasks-one requiring self-reflective mentation and the other requiring continuous stimulus processing and decision-making. By training a multivariate classifier model to identify functional connectivity patterns uniquely associated with each task set, we will be able to track the expression of these connectivity signatures over time. This will allow us to test whether the recollection of negative life events disproportionately impairs one's ability to efficiently reconfigure cortical network dynamics during the transition between tasks. Such metrics could eventually be used to aid in the diagnosis of MDD or the identification of those most prone to relapse. Indeed, given current NIMH priorities for treatment development, using such a endophenotype (Miller & Rockstroh, 2013) as a treatment target may warrant high priority.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to control declarative memory processes is a critical ability in daily life and is a process that appears to be dysfunctional in major depressiv disorder (MDD) patients, who have difficulty breaking away from cycles of negative rumination. Using a novel experimental paradigm and an innovative fMRI analysis approach, we aim to advance understanding of the functioning of these cognitive and neural systems in healthy participants. The future directions of this research will be to apply our fMRI protocol to MDD patients to potentially aid in the diagnosis and treatment of this disorder, which is a leading source of disability worldwide.            ",Neurocognitive Mechanisms of the Executive Control of Memory and Emotion,9122745,F31MH110114,"['Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Questionnaires', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'distraction', 'emotion regulation', 'endophenotype', 'executive function', 'improved', 'indexing', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'memory process', 'negative affect', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'operation', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory stimulus', 'stimulus processing', 'subclinical depression', 'therapy development']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F31,2016,35305,673201228,-0.007322870330313742
"QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tissue identification and quantification plays a significant role in the study of aging and age-related diseases. For example, the accumulation of fat in the human body and its regional distribution with aging is associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Changes in muscle composition are strongly linked to decline of muscle strength, decreased mobility caused by aging, or musculoskeletal disorders. Especially interesting is analysis of longitudinal changes of morphometric descriptors that is significant for studying the aging process and for the diagnosis and prevention of age-related diseases.  Medical imaging has emerged as a major tool for estimation of body composition mainly due to being non- invasive and producing multi-dimensional information. Nowadays MRI and CT acquisition is a central component of clinical trials. An abundance of imaging data is collected, but this wealth of information has not been utilized to full extent. Therefore research on image analysis techniques for tissue quantification that are reproducible and can be used on large-scale clinical trials is of particular importance.  The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse body composition data from modern MRI and CT imaging. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that qualitative body composition phenotypes on clinical imaging will differentiate individuals who are healthy versus those who are not. The goal of our work is to provide a foundation for image analysis of the abdomen and lower extremities and to study the relationship between body morphological changes and age-related pathologies.  We will build upon recent advances in medical image computing to segment muscle, regional adipose tissue, and bone in clinical CT and MRI scans. We will also develop image registration procedures to achieve intra- and inter-subject correspondence and make efficient use of information provided by multi-modal and multi-temporal imaging data collected in clinical trials (aim 1). After these methods have been developed, we will address the hypothesis that quantitative use of clinical imaging can increase the prognostic accuracy of age-related pathologies (aim2). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age-related diseases such as type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and sarcopenia have become a worldwide epidemic and affect the quality of life of millions. To give a global perspective, roughly 343.8 million people in the world have type-2 diabetes today, and 175 million don't know they have diabetes at all. Metabolic diseases are strongly linked to longitudinal changes in body composition, morphology and function. This project will contribute novel and non-invasive medical image analysis techniques for studying the human body composition and its changes with increasing age to achieve timely prognosis of these pathologies.",QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES,9044803,SC3GM113754,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delaware', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Role', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Techniques', 'Thigh structure', 'Tissues', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age related', 'biophysical model', 'bone', 'effective therapy', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'morphometry', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'reduced muscle strength', 'sarcopenia', 'statistics', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY,SC3,2016,63620,4139254,-0.007931231969643222
"Intrinsic Cortical Networks and Cognitive Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson's disease (PD) affects 1% of adults over age 65. While traditionally defined by motor symptoms, up to 75% of PD patients will eventually develop dementia making it the leading cause of nursing home placement in this population. Although there is currently no cure for PD, our ability to treat motor symptoms has advanced tremendously since the 1960's based on advances in our understanding of motor symptom neurophysiology. I propose that the treatment and prevention of dementia in PD may also prove possible through advances in our understanding of the neurophysiology of cognitive dysfunction. I will use modern network theory as a theoretical and mathematical framework for this endeavor. My long-term goal is to advance our fundamental understanding of the neurophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in PD to provide empirically testable models, clinically relevant biomarkers, and novel therapeutic targets. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that patterns of cortical functional connectivity critical to normal cognitive function are disruptd by subcortical pathology in PD and that interventions which normalize these patterns will improve cognition. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data presented in this proposal and other previously published work. The research objectives of this proposal are to further our understanding of how cortical connectivity relates to cognitive dysfunction in PD, develop a novel biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in PD based on cortical physiology and to determine whether modulation of cortical connectivity may result in cognitive improvements in PD. We will accomplish the objectives of this proposal through three Specific Aims: 1) Determine whether graph theory measures of functional cortical activity measured with magneto encephalography (MEG) are associated with cognitive dysfunction in PD subjects with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI); 2) Develop a novel state-defining biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in PD based on MEG features through a machine learning approach; and 3) Determine the effects of repetitive trans cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on MEG measures of cortical connectivity and cognitive outcomes in PD-MCI patients. The approach is innovative because it represents the first study to apply graph theory measures to understanding the relationship of cortical physiology and cognitive dysfunction in PD; the first study to apply machine learning approaches to cognitive PD biomarker development; and the first clinical trial or mechanistic study of rTMS in PD-MCI. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in PD and will provide biomarkers and pilot data essential to planning future therapeutic interventions. The training objectives and related research activities of this proposal will provide new skills, manuscripts and pilot data related to advanced MEG analysis, graph theory, biomarker development and rTMS trials necessary to establish my independence in these areas and obtain R01 funding to advance this unique research program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dementia is the leading cause of nursing home placement in Parkinson's disease (PD) yet little is known about the cause(s) of cognitive dysfunction in PD and there are no effective treatments. Our preliminary data and other published studies suggest that abnormalities in brain activity involving networks important for normal thinking and memory may contribute to cognitive dysfunction in PD and may represent a target for treatment. This proposal will identify abnormalities in cortical activity related to cognitive dysfunction in PD usng magneto encephalography and will perform a randomized control trial of frontal repetitive trans cranial magnetic stimulation to determine the therapeutic potential of modulating this brain activity.",Intrinsic Cortical Networks and Cognitive Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease,9084675,K02NS080885,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Cephalic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Elderly', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Motor Cortex', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nursing Homes', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Rest', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker identification', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'effective therapy', 'encephalography', 'graph theory', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'motor symptom', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'physiologic model', 'programs', 'screening', 'skills', 'theories', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K02,2016,132354,292134808,0.026167089478867787
"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,9099840,K01ES025442,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Applied Skills', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'reward anticipation', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,144298,607172798,0.017463348234548974
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,9084432,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Eotaxin', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2016,156324,507546965,-0.002289415916197279
"A Strength Analysis Tool for Studying Healthy Aging via Exercise in C. elegans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exercise is arguably the most potent approach we can take to defer physical decline associated with aging and to protect against late onset diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. Molecular understanding of how exercise benefits translate into healthy aging is thus of definitive medical interest. We study fundamental processes relevant to healthy aging in the 959-celled nematode C. elegans. Recently we made a fascinating discovery-C. elegans can exercise (swim) to exhibit training benefits, and appear to gain benefits by molecular pathways conserved in humans. Our initial model development opens up a new research area for understanding how tissue-specific and organism-wide health benefits are induced by exercise, and creates a novel paradigm for identifying exercise mimetic drugs that might promote healthy aging. To really harvest the potential of this model, we need to measure the strength of the tiny C. elegans. We collaborated to develop a strength test in which trained animals thread through a matrix of deformable pillars, and the extent of pillar deflection is used to calculate force. Our ""NemaFlex"" force detection device is the quantitative foundation with which we expect to break new ground in understanding exercise impact on healthy aging. Here we propose required development to enhance assay throughput and pursue applications that will not only anchor this technology as an essential component of C. elegans exercise evaluation but also accelerate studies on exercise biology and healthy aging in this powerful model. Aim 1 is to develop a novel high throughput tool for direct strength evaluation in C. elegans.  This aim will generate an essential tool for analysis of C. elegans strength at multiple life stages, define the exercise regimen that will become the anchor protocol in the field, and reveal features of training in this model. Aim 2 is to use NemaFlex to evaluate exercise mimetic drugs & to facilitate focused pilot genetic screens. This aim will establish critical proof-of-principle for genetic and drug discovery using the NemaFlex. Aim 3 is to initiate dissection of the functional and molecular relationship between exercise and healthy aging, grounded in NemaFlex force measures of training benefits.  To begin, we will test how optimized strength training tracks with a broad spectrum of healthspan indicators that decline with age, we will investigate impact of cessation of training on aging quality, and we will ask if exercise mimetic drugs extend healthspan in the absence of training. Our goals will create novel technology that for the first time permits facile quantitativ analysis of exercise adaptations in the powerful C. elegans genetic model. Accomplishment of our tractable aims will anchor a new subfield of genetic investigation of exercise and healthy aging that may influence design of interventions that broadly promote health and defer aging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Exercise has a profound positive impact on health of the aging population in that it protects against age-associated diseases including cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, at the same time it maintains muscle, immune system, and nervous system function in aging. We are developing the first exercise model in the simple animal C. elegans, in which training benefits appear mediated by conserved mechanisms and exercise promotes healthy aging. We will optimize a novel tool for direct strength measurement of these tiny 959-celled animals and show how our device can facilitate searches for exercise mimetic drugs and genes that are associated with training adaptations, and can also help define exercise impact on a broad range of healthy aging measures. The experimental advantages of C. elegans may yield unexpected insights that inspire development of novel interventions that protect against age-associated disease and age-associated decline.",A Strength Analysis Tool for Studying Healthy Aging via Exercise in C. elegans,9116734,R21AG050503,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biology of Aging', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Muscle', 'Muscle function', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pump', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Staging', 'Swimming', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Work', 'age-related muscle loss', 'aging population', 'anti aging', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'exercise regimen', 'exercise training', 'experience', 'fascinate', 'healthy aging', 'immune function', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'mimetics', 'model development', 'new technology', 'novel', 'programs', 'strength training', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NIA,TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,184503,5488393,-0.008513665615117271
"Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08) is to provide the candidate with extensive training in 1) machine learning, 2) neuroimaging and 3) developmental psychopathology to conduct independent investigations on the neurobiology that underlies psychopathology that results from childhood maltreatment. There is strong evidence that maltreatment during childhood results in differences across multiple circuits in the developing brain. The extent that affected circuits are involved in psychopathology, however, is unclear. Determining which circuits are involved is necessary to develop interventions that target specific neurobiological systems. The primary aims of the proposed studies are to clarify the involvement of multiple brain features (e.g., structures and functional activations) in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These aims will be accomplished with machine learning. Machine learning is a set of computer-based learning methods in which meaningful theoretical models are derived from empirical data. This proposal builds on the candidate's prior training in clinical psychology, neurobiological models of traumatic stress, and advanced computational methods to develop expertise in: 1) computational methods that include machine learning, genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks, 2) the collection of multi-modal neuroimaging data and 3) the effect of maltreatment on development. Additional professional development training will include grantsmanship, manuscript preparation, and research ethics. To achieve these aims, the candidate has assembled an accomplished mentorship team of experts that span a range of disciplines including developmental psychopathology, computational science, and neuroscience. The training and mentorship will allow the candidate to conduct a series of research studies with two primary aims. The first is to use machine learning to develop a model that integrates structural and task-based functional MRI data to differentiate adolescents with a history of maltreatment from controls. Identifying the features that best differentiate these groups will determine which circuits are implicated in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These models will be constructed with data from an existing high-dimensional database that was obtained by project mentors. The second aim is to obtain pilot data on the association between variations in brain regions and the severity of psychopathology in a sample of maltreated adolescents. When this research is completed, the brain features most affected by maltreatment will be identified and the relation between these brain features and observable symptoms will be quantified. Such knowledge will provide a set of targets for treatment and assist in our classification of maltreatment-related mental illness. The experience and data obtained from this project will position the candidate to pursue future NIH funding to further examine the neurobiology of maltreatment- related psychopathology in adolescence.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Child abuse prior to adolescence is associated with marked impairment across the lifespan and is a significant public health concern. There is considerable need to understand how abuse in childhood affects the developing brain and how these changes correspond to observable maladaptive behaviors during adolescence. This project aims to quantify the contribution of brain circuits to maltreatment-related psychopathology in order to improve diagnosis and identify targets for intervention.        ",Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning,9108475,K08MH107661,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08)', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'computer science', 'conditioned fear', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'maltreatment', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'putamen', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K08,2016,190952,66370127,0.011118837602669095
"Pattern Classification Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Traumatic Brain Injury PROJECT SUMMARY Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) affects ~1.5 million persons annually in the United States with fifteen to 30% of patients suffering long-term disability after injury. We remain in the early phase of understanding this disease and one of the greatest barriers to studying the disease and developing appropriate therapy is the difficulty in diagnosis and outcome prediction. Generally, the diagnosis of MTBI relies on using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), a 15-point gross measurement of eye-opening, motor and verbal response. The National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) workshop in 2014 indicated that use of GCS score as a single classifier for TBI is insufficient and proposed that neuroimaging play a larger role towards the development of objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction. We have specific experience in studying novel MRI techniques that show much promise in evaluating MTBI patients. The goal of the current proposal is to bring these novel MRI techniques to clinical use. We propose to combine information from objective MR imaging features with clinical information to learn the patterns that can best distinguish patients from controls and predict long-term outcome using machine learning. We will validate our tool using a separate subject cohort. Such a tool would be an extremely powerful clinical tool to identify at-risk patients for early intervention. Additionally, this research will identify the most clinically relevant MR metrics, thereby pointing the way to novel therapeutic pathways. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is a major public health problem for which there is a lack of evidence-based, quantitative and objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction. The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate recent advances in MR imaging of MTBI with clinically important information using advanced machine-learning computational algorithms to identify the most clinically relevant features, thus allowing us to distinguish patients from controls and to predict clinical outcome. If successful, this research will provide an objective tool for classification and outcome prediction in MTBI and will be a critical advance in both the clinical and research arenas in the study of traumatic brain injury.",Pattern Classification Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Traumatic Brain Injury,9180408,R21NS090349,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Common Data Element', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Eye', 'FarGo', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glasgow Coma Scale', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Iron', 'Learning', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurons', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Non-linear Models', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Societies', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'disability', 'drug development', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'magnetic field', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'mood regulation', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2016,196059,329565273,-0.01217498270583489
"Neural Mechanisms of Aging Stereotypes on Cognition ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project uses neuroimaging to enrich our understanding of the impact of negative aging stereotypes on cognitive performance in older adults - a phenomenon known as ""stereotype threat"". We will identify task-related brain activity associated with stereotype threat, and the extent to which individual beliefs in memory ability, stereotype self-relevance, and anxiety mediate these neural effects. We also will test two hypothesized mechanisms of threat, using traditional fMRI methods and novel pattern classifier techniques. This project will inform theories of ageist stereotype threat at the psychological and neural level, which is critical for disentangling the effects of aging-related neural decline and social factors on brain activity. The impact of stereotype threat on cognitive tests has significan public health implications, not only for cognitive functioning in daily life, but because cognitive tests are used to diagnose the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease. To the extent that threat impairs performance on these tests, an individual's true cognitive ability would be underestimated. In our study, cognitively normal older adults will be explicitly exposed to negative stereotypes about aging memory (threat condition) or a positive, age-fair framing of the task (control condition). Next, during fMRI, they will take a recollection task known to be sensitive to aging stereotype threat effects. The neural mechanisms of stereotype threat will be determined by directly comparing brain activity between the threat and control groups, as well as comparisons to brain activity in younger adult groups that are tested in conditions that simulate the cognitive processes thought to drive stereotype threat. In determining which neural mechanisms drive stereotype threat in aging populations, we hope to minimize the negative impact of ageist stereotypes on older adults, in daily cognitive routines and in medical settings where cognitive tests are used for diagnosis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research studies ageist stereotype effects on cognition, using psychological measures and neuroimaging to identify the causes of stereotype effects in different people. Understanding stereotypes can help individuals avoid them, thereby increasing the well-being of older adults.            ",Neural Mechanisms of Aging Stereotypes on Cognition,9061560,R21AG049931,"['Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Automobile Driving', 'Belief', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stereotyping', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age difference', 'age related', 'anxiety states', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'emotion regulation', 'expectation', 'interest', 'mental state', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'sample fixation', 'social', 'theories', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2016,197500,246330700,0.003581622010010805
"Computational modeling of semantic decline in Alzheimer's disease Project Summary To interact, communicate, and navigate the world successfully, people must retrieve relevant information from their semantic memory (memory for facts and general knowledge). Individuals with Alzheimer's disease have difficulty retrieving such knowledge from early in the course of the disease and progressively gets worse as the disease spreads, a process known as semantic decline. This project examines the mechanisms underlying semantic decline in individuals with Alzheimer's disease by developing and applying novel computational tools. The extent to which semantic memory is impaired in individuals with Alzheimer's disease can be probed using behavioral experiments. Individuals with Alzheimer's as well as those at-risk for the disease display a pattern of behavior on these tasks distinct from healthy individuals. Despite decades of research, explanations of these behavioral impairments focus almost exclusively on cognitive mechanisms that may explain a patient's current behavior at a given time point, but without an account of the transition from normal, pre-symptomatic behavior to fully impaired behavior. Existing models fail to explain the mechanisms by which semantic memory and memory retrieval processes degrade over time due to Alzheimer's, limiting our understanding of the development of the disease, as well as hindering our ability for prognosis, early detection measures, and possible interventions. This project will test computational models of how the disease spreads, making specific quantitative predictions about the decline of semantic memory. Additionally, we will develop a novel machine learning method that can be used to map the structure of an individual's semantic memory, creating opportunities for individualized behavioral interventions to improve semantic memory and improve the quality of life for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Project Narrative This project examines the mechanisms underlying decline of semantic memory (memory for knowledge) in individuals with Alzheimer's disease by developing and applying novel computational models. This research will develop methods for testing neurocognitive theories of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases, inform interventions for mitigating decline, and further our understanding of how the disease spreads.",Computational modeling of semantic decline in Alzheimer's disease,9164777,R21AG053467,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Family', 'Free Association', 'Huntington Disease', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Semantic memory', 'Semantics', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Walking', 'Work', 'behavioral impairment', 'computerized tools', 'contagion', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'memory retrieval', 'neurocognitive test', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'research study', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2016,206644,338121506,-0.05971563969836985
"Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The quest for fast image acquisition speed has always been a perennial topic in the MRI community. To reduce the acquisition time for maximal spatial and temporal resolution, modern MRI protocols usually perform reduced acquisitions below the Nyquist rate. The reduced data is then used to reconstruct the image through advanced reconstruction techniques that leverage some prior information about the MRI system (e.g., parallel imaging) and/or MR signal (e.g., compressed sensing). Since such prior information is patient and system specific, recent techniques obtain the prior information using training data obtained through an empirical calibration procedure. All existing methods assume the prior models are linear. Since the intrinsic nonlinear relationship in the training data cannot be characterized in such simple models, the reconstruction is degraded by the inaccuracy of the prior information. Nonlinear learning from the training data have proven to be more powerful in machine learning because it is more general and includes the linear model as a special case. However, it is usually more challenging to learn the nonlinear models and even more challenging to incorporate the model in reconstruction due to the increased degree of freedom. We recently have introduced a novel concept of ""kernel"" in MR reconstruction to address the above challenges timely. Our preliminary results on parallel imaging and sparsity-constrained reconstruction demonstrate that the kernel-based algorithms improve the reconstruction quality over the original algorithms with linear prior models. Built upon our strong preliminary results, the objective of this application is to develop an innovative kernel-based framework for MR image reconstruction from undersampled data. This framework does not require explicit knowledge of nonlinear mapping (as in preliminary work) such that a broader family of nonlinear functions can be explored for different clinical applications. The proposed work is expected to advance the field of MR image reconstruction vertically. Specifically, the successful completion of the proposed project will result in a general framework leading to many new algorithms (including two developed in this project) for reconstruction from reduced acquisition. Therefore, virtually all of current clinical MRI could benefit from the improved resolution, image quality, and/or reduced acquisition times that the new framework will facilitate or the novel applications i may enable. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is to develop a general framework and two specific new techniques to improve the spatial resolution and/or reduce the scan time in magnetic resonance imaging and evaluate the performance of the techniques for 3D parallel imaging and quantitative imaging in brain. The development of such novel fast imaging techniques may greatly enhance diagnosis of neurological disease. Therefore the project will potentially benefit numerous subjects and the healthcare system.",Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling,9119020,R21EB020861,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Family', 'Freedom', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-linear Models', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Polynomial Models', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R21,2016,222652,73424103,-0.012774695083696073
"Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neurological diseases occur in the absence of neurodegenerative pathology, such as neurotransmission disorders. Deficient neurotransmission is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, deterioration in synaptic function also appears during ageing, accompanied by a decline in cognitive and behavioral function. Synaptic strength and plasticity, important in cognitive functions such as memory, are affected by synaptic activity. However, the regulators of synaptic strength, either activity-dependent or independent, are far from understood. Here, I propose to explore how environmental cues and ageing can affect synaptic morphology in the nematode C. elegans, and how this correlates to synaptic function and activity. In C. elegans, which is an excellent model for neuroscience, synaptic sites can be observed with fluorescent fusion proteins. However, fluorescently labeled synaptic sites are small and faint, and obtaining large number of high-content data poses many experimental limitations. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate regulators of synaptic function through multidimensional morphological profiling of synaptic sites. This work is composed of a mentored and an independent research phase. During the mentored phase, I will develop tools that allow high-throughput quantitative multidimensional profiling of synaptic morphology in large populations of animals. These tools are based on combining microfluidics, automation, and computer vision methods for image analysis, which enable streamlined quantitative morphological characterization of synaptic sites. In addition to this, tools to determine synaptic function in the motor circuit through the quantification of locomotive activity and controlled stimulation of excitatory neurons will be developed to correlate synaptic morphology to function. The mentored phase will also include extensive training in various aspects: technology development, biology and neuroscience, and career development. The scientific environment at the institution of the mentored phase is highly collaborative and provides excellent support in terms of facilities and intellectual opportunities. During the independent research phase, I plan to apply the developed tools during the mentored phase to uncover how environmental cues can affect synaptic function through activity dependent or independent mechanisms. I will also utilize these tools to study synaptic decline during aging, and how exposure to environmental regulators of synaptic function during development can alter synaptic decline during aging. In this way, we will be able to address a biological question unapproachable with conventional methods. This approach is innovative not only because the technology developed will greatly increase the throughput and quality of characterization, but also because it proposes studying the links between form and function in synaptic sites. This project is significant because it will enable streamlined morphological studies in neuroscience, which should lead to uncovering pathways, genes and potential therapies for synaptic function deficiencies due to disease or age-related decline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Defective neurotransmission is the cause of many neurological diseases ranging from depression to autism. Understanding the regulators of synaptic strength can shed light on pathways that play a role in establishing healthy synaptic function, and treatments for neurotransmission-related diseases.",Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization,9213710,R00AG046911,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Descriptor', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institution', 'Ion Channel', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Cleft', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'career development', 'cognitive function', 'excitatory neuron', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'neurotransmitter release', 'neurotransmitter uptake', 'normal aging', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'synaptic function', 'technology development', 'tissue fixing', 'tool']",NIA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R00,2016,249000,32532200,0.008130076317410952
"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.     What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.     What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented.         Protections for Human Subjects:    Acceptable        Vertebrate Animals:    Not applicable        Resource Sharing:    Acceptable. Data management plan is reasonable. Published data will be shared upon request when practically and ethically possible.        Budget and Period of Support:    Recommend as Requested Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms. By isolating the contribution of  different memory systems to learned choice, this project may help to guide future treatment strategies.",CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions,9098673,R01DA038891,"['Accounting', 'Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Budgets', 'Choice Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Drug abuse', 'Eating Disorders', 'Employee Strikes', 'Episodic memory', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Female', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Midbrain structure', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Vertebrates', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'data management', 'dopamine system', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human subject protection', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'outreach', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'role model', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIDA,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,326999,58504236,0.02247620125653631
"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,9134899,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mining', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'data mining', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'response', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,334212,641965656,0.02416399865290204
"Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Designing an efficient Huntington's disease (HD) early intervention clinical trial for individuals who have an expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene requires identifying and combining clinical, biological, cognitive, and brain imaging markers to accurately distinguish among subjects who will have a diagnosis during a given intervention period and those who will not, and to track early changes in the disease course. The goal of this project is to identify sensitive biomarkers for HD risk stratification, indexing disease progression, and developing clinical trial endpoints. The proposal directly adheres to ""2P's"" of the NIH New Strategic Vision of the ""4P's"" of Medicine: they will offer promising ways to predict when the disease will develop; and increase the capacity to personalize early intervention based on the informative patient-specific markers our models identify. Combining biomarkers to predict HD onset and progression is an essential step in a continuum of research for development of disease-modifying therapies. Composite markers and their risk profiles created from our model will offer quantitative way to monitor and compare potential interventions. Evidence collected from these comparisons will advance the development of efficacy studies in premanifest HD, where neuroprotective treatments would be most beneficial. We develop and apply a series of cutting-edge statistical learning methods based on support vector machine (SVM), variable selection, and dimension reduction to achieve these goals. These modern statistical methods designed for correlated big data have quickly emerged as among the most successful tools for hypothesis generation, classification and prediction in biomedical studies. However, they have not been introduced to HD biomarker research. In aim 1, using counting process, we propose SVM to handle time-to-event outcomes (e.g., time-to-HD-diagnosis) to combine markers into risk scores to discriminate subjects who will experience HD onset in the immediate future from those who will not,  based on their personalized features. Although SVM is well studied for binary outcomes, it is far less explored for time-to-event outcomes. We fill this gap in knowledge. In aim 2, we propose new learning methods for longitudinal outcomes to combine markers that modify the course of HD signs to monitor disease process and distinguish subjects with rapid progression from those with slower progression. In aim 3, we propose to use novel and robust performance measures to compare derived combined markers with existing disease indices and key markers. These aims will fundamentally advance our understanding of markers linked to HD onset and progression. The creation of statistical models for composite markers and risk profiles is especially useful in: (1) offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare potential interventions, and (2) improving power of efficacy studies targeted at premanifest individuals by narrowing the predictive interval which leads to future clinical trials that can be made shorter with fewer subjects. Finally, our improved predictions of HD onset and progression will provide more informative genetic counseling sessions for pre-symptomatic subjects at risk of HD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of Huntington's disease (HD) research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay onset or slow disease progression, and to provide different treatment regimens at each disease stage. To meet this goal, this proposal develops and applies a series of advanced statistical approaches to rank and combine clinical, behavioral, and brain imaging markers to predict HD diagnosis in premanifest subjects during a given time period and to measure disease progression. The creation of model for composite markers and risk profiles is useful in offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare interventions and powering clinical trials for premanifest HD individuals.",Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.,9119862,U01NS082062,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'CAG repeat', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Early intervention trials', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic screening method', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Huntington Disease', 'Huntington gene', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'affection', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'research and development', 'tool']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2016,356244,558628098,-0.009523001031058288
"4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging allows safe, non-invasive measurement of brain structures and functions and their changes over time. This has led to many longitudinal studies to discover imaging biomarkers for better prediction of brain disorders. However, the associated longitudinal changes are often tiny within a short follow-up time, and are thus difficult to detect by conventional methods since the measurement errors could be larger than the actual changes. Also, with the significant increase of data with longitudinal follow-ups, it becomes challenging to capture a small set of effective imaging biomarkers from large data for accurate disease prediction. This issue becomes even more critical when there is missing data in the longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. The goal of this renewal project is to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. These tools wil allow elucidating subtle abnormal changes that would be otherwise left undetected with existing tools. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will create a novel multi-atlas guided 4D brain labelling method for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject. All longitudinal images of each subject will be first aligned by a novel groupwise 4D registration algorithm that can more accurately estimate longitudinal deformations. Then, these aligned longitudinal images can be further registered with multiple atlases guided by a graph that locally connects all (subject and atlas) images, thus obtaining more accurate/consistent registration and ROI labeling for the longitudinal images of same subject. In Aim 2, we will further create a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model to effectively integrate serial imaging and non-imaging biomarkers for early diagnosis and prediction of brain status. Also, to further extract effective biomarkers, a new machine learning technique, called deep learning, will be adapted to learn high-level features for helping prediction with a novel temporally-constrained group sparse learning method, which is able to predict clinical scores consistently for future time-points. Finally, in Aim 3, we will create nove methods to deal with missing data in longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. In particular, we will first develop several data completion methods (including matrix completion) to complete the missing data. Then, instead of designing a single predictor that may be limited, we will design multiple diverse predictors (by multi-task learning) for ensemble prediction, thus significantly increasing the overall prediction performance. Also, considering that the individual's future images are not available at early time-points, to improve the clinical utility of the proposed methods, we will apply our models to various cases with different numbers of longitudinal images and then further train them jointly to achieve the overall best performance. Note that the performance of all proposed methods will be evaluated in this project for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) study, although they are also applicable to studies of other brain disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel multi-atlases guided 4D brain labelling framework for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across the longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject by harnessing the manifold of anatomical variation of 4D image and the atlases, 2) a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model that will automatically learn the relevant information from imaging and non-imaging data of past time-points to predict future status of brain, and 3) novel methods for missing data completion and then multiple diverse predictors for ensemble prediction. We will also make these methods practical for clinical diagnostics setting. Finally, we will package all our methods into a softwar tool and release it publicly, as we have done before. The methods that we will develop can find their applications not only in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that will be used as example in this project, but also in other fields such as longitudinal monitoring of other neurological diseases (i.e., schizophrenia) and measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain.",4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease,9058040,R01EB008374,"['4D Imaging', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Schizophrenia', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2016,451650,511185245,-0.017135297644644505
"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,9134892,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Controlled Study', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'motor symptom', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2016,563079,146629556,0.01768316713774747
"Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate mapping of normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and premature neonates is a key factor in the early detection of developmental disorders as well as understanding how external factors can influence early brain growth. The combination of fast multi-slice MRI techniques with computer vision algorithms has recently provided the ability to reliably image 3D brain structure in-utero providing valuable information inaccessible to ultrasound imaging. To complement this new structural information, recently there has been increasing interest in the use of functional MR imaging (fMRI) to map the development of resting state brain function in children, premature neonates and, most recently, fetuses in-utero. This work has revealed signs of a predictable developmental path in the formation of resting state patterns of brain activity present in adults and abnormalities in these patterns in children have been linked with neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions in later life. Such fMRI methods, previously used in adults and children, could provide a unique new window into functional activity in the developing fetal brain. However, the imaging techniques required suffer from an important limitation for use in the fetus: they make use of repeated acquisitions where subtle changes in MR signal provide the measure of interest. Fetal head motion within the scanner perturbs both measurement location and signal level due to the changing relationship between fetal anatomy, maternal anatomy and the scanner. Based on our preliminary results, in this proposal we plan to develop a set of new signal and geometry correction methods specifically for fetal fMRI that combine novel acquisition techniques with post-processing algorithms to provide a new route to addressing these unique problems. This will allow us to collect the first accurate functional MRI data from a range of un-sedated fetuses in ages and activity levels seen in clinical studies. We will develop and validate these methods together with complementary pattern analysis techniques specifically aimed at motion scattered data and employ them to build the first combined 4D structure-function map of brain development in-utero. This will show for the first time the temporal and spatial relationship between structural changes and the development of resting state patterns of brain activity covering the critical age of first clinical MRI scan and the following period of cortical folding. his will help answer such questions as: which tissue zones of the fetal brain such activity begins, and whether the functional patterns are related to the timing of the formation of specific cortical folds. We will collect a range of data that captures fetuses both at different ages and different states of activity representing those seen in typical clinical studies, and in addition collect valuable outcome measures on the babies after birth against which in-utero measure will be evaluated. We release the data to the community as a whole in the form of an open-access 4D atlas. This combined structure-function data will provide a unique new reference for both neuroscience and, in the longer term, clinical evaluation of brain health during pregnancy and premature birth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinically, improved in-utero evaluation of the fetal brain is a key concern for obstetricians and pediatricians in managing complex pregnancies and there is also now an increasing public health awareness of the influence of the in-utero environment, in terms of factors such as stress and diet, on long-term health in adult life. Functional connectivit imaging of the brain in childhood has revealed the presence of early markers of later cognitive and neuropsychological problems. The ability to map these same properties in utero, promises to provide a rich set of very specific early markers that can be used to understand the impact of the in-utero environment on brain function and feasibly provide a route to the use of early neuro-protective agents and procedures early in childhood.",Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero,9067148,R01EB017133,"['Accounting', 'Acoustic Stimulation', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Movement', 'Fetus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protective Agents', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'brain health', 'brain tissue', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'heart rate monitor', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in utero', 'interest', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'population based', 'premature neonates', 'research clinical testing', 'spatial relationship', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2016,642962,533302350,0.012989776697985685
"Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is estimated that neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia will surpass cancer as the leading cause of death by the year 2040. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, followed by synucleinopathies, such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, biomarkers, and treatment options for these neurodengenerative diseases, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process. To address this unmet need Advanced Brain Monitoring (ABM) proposes to leverage two previously developed technologies to create an Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS). The core components of the INSPECDS platform will be a previously developed Alertness and Memory Profiler (AMP), a recently developed Sleep Profiler, and integrated machine-learning, classification algorithms, hosted on a secure, cloud-based, infrastructure for automated data processing, analysis, and reporting. The AMP was developed and validated during a previous NIH-funded SBIR Phase I/II project for the purpose of detecting the neurocognitive effects of sleep deprivation in adults diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea. The AMP is truly unique among neurocognitive testing platforms in that it is the only one which integrates advanced, electrophysiological measures (e.g., 24-channel, wireless EEG and ECG) during the performance of computerized neurocognitive tasks. This advanced capability permits researchers to explore real-time relations between fluctuations in alertness, discrete cognitive functions, and specific neural processes believed to subserve observed performance deficits. The Sleep Profiler is an FDA-cleared, easily applied, wireless-EEG device that was developed and validated to measure sleep architecture for in-home sleep studies. With integrated measures of submental (chin) EMG and wireless accelerometers to monitor head and limb movements, the Sleep Profiler is an ideal device for quantifying the characteristics of REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD), which is considered to be a prodromal expression of synucleinopathy. Furthermore, the application of sophisticated, machine-learning, classification algorithms will streamline the processing and analyses of these data to derive statistical probabilities of various dementia subtypes. The overarching goal of the current, Direct-to-Phase II, SBIR project is to develop a secure, cloud-based infrastructure to compile the data obtained from the AMP and Sleep Profiler, train classification algorithms to discriminate among dementia subtypes, validate diagnostic accuracy, and integrate optimized classifiers within the cloud-based architecture. Once completed, the INSPECDS system will be the first clinical research tool of its kind and find immediate application in both university-based research settings and pharmaceutical industry clinical trials to aid in the endophenotypic stratification of research participants.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, clinical course, and treatment options for neurodengenerative diseases, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process. To address this unmet need, Advanced Brain Monitoring (Carlsbad, CA) is developing Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profilers for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS), which will provide an inexpensive, non-invasive solution combining neurocognitive, electrophysiological (EEG, ECG, EMG), and sleep-behavior assessment into a single, integrated system featuring automated scoring and classification algorithms.

"Computer-aided detection of focal cortical dysplasias ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project proposes to build computer-aided detection (CAD) software for use in identifying cortical malformations known as focal cortical dysplasia's (FCDs), which are a common cause of epileptic seizures. The intent is for the software, used by a neuroradiologist at a clinical workstation, to decrease the time- intensive nature of the visual search for cortical dysplasia's, while simultaneously increasing sensitivity o dysplasia identification, thus reducing the number of missed lesions and making neuroradiologists more effective and more efficient.  Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures, that exacts a large toll upon society in terms of both quality of life and health care costs. Malformations of cortical development (MCD) are the most common cause of seizures in children and the second most common cause in adults. Focal cortical dysplasia is a common form of MCD that is responsible for the vast majority of treatment resistant epilepsy in patients with MCD, and when anti-epileptic medication is ineffective, detection of FCD becomes critical to the ability of the epilepsy team to offer surgery which is often these patient's last hope for seizure freedom.  Unfortunately, the radiological diagnosis of FCD is exceedingly difficult in a large percentage of cases due to their focal and subtle nature. Thus, while resection of these dysplasias can often cure seizures, they can be missed for years or decades, resulting in increased neurological damage and degradation of quality of life due to chronic seizures. In principle high resolution MRI can be used to increase diagnostic accuracy. While this is becoming more common in clinical practice, the need for high patient throughput, lack of clinical information and inexperience often results i these lesions being missed on routine clinical reads by neuroradiologists.  The project will build upon a foundation of existing technology for the generation of quantitative measures of the human brain based on MRI imaging, known in the neuroimaging research domain as FreeSurfer. The project will make use of an MRI dataset of 100 subjects with histologically-confirmed FCD to be labeled by four neuroradiologists, and control subjects with epilepsy that is not due to FCD. The project has three aims: gathering the dataset and expansion of the detection algorithms tested in Phase I to include additional MRI biomarkers; development of an MRI scanner slice prescription component to ensure imaging of an FCD at the optimal visualization plane; and an aim to submit a commercialized version of FreeSurfer for FDA 510(k) clearance. The latter aim is important for the long-term project goal of advancing the state of other clinical detection methods through the building of additional CAD tools making use of FreeSurfer's brain measures, including diseases as varied as Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, tumor monitoring and hydrocephalus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposal is to build software for computer-aided detection of focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs), a malformation of brain development that is a common cause of epileptic seizures in children and adults. The proposed software will offer a neuroradiologist a faster and more accurate detection method compared to visual inspection only.

"Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disrupted circadian timing has emerged as a serious health and safety issue, yet there are no objective means of easily assessing circadian timing or alignment without performing a highly controlled, multiple-day in- patient study. Altered circadian timing can cause both sleep loss and sleepiness, cause performance errors such as motor vehicle accidents, and impair memory/learning. Thus, despite the obvious need to recognize an individual's circadian phase/alignment, we cannot assess circadian timing clinically or in retrospective studies. Not surprisingly, the first goal of the 2011 NIH Sleep Disorders Research Plan is to identify: ""...metabolic... biomarkers of sleep deficiency and biological timing...and circadian disorders that will facilitate personalized treatments, and clarify the risk associated with untreated sleep and circadian disorders and disturbances."" We are aware that major challenges face biomarker development, including multi-factorial causes of metabolite shifts normally controlled across multiple time-points. Because circadian time is associated with profound metabolic, immune and cardiovascular changes, however, we hypothesize that a biomarker signature for circadian phase derived from -omic markers can be obtained from a single blood sample. We therefore propose to utilize the analytical and bioinformatics platforms and experience in population-level metabolomics studies in the PIs lab to study banked plasma samples from the well-characterized individuals in six tightly controlled circadian rhythm studies run by the four co-investigators.The Aims are:  Aim 1: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and t cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics-  based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples drawn from three constant routine protocols Aim 2: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and to cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples  drawn from four forced desynchrony protocols  Aim 3: To systematically evaluate the validated profiles from Aims 1 and 2 and their mathematical  similarities and differences so as to improve accuracy and precision of the biomarkers  Aim 4: To test the markers identified above under poorly controlled real world applications Identification of biomarker panels will impact multiple aspects of science and health: (i) contribute to clinical recognition and treatment on circadian disorders; (ii) advance personalized medicine through individualized treatment timing to enhance efficacy/reduce side effects of medications (e.g., chemotherapy); (iii) creating epidemiologic tools to relate circadian with disease risk; and aiding development of other disease biomarkers, and; (iv) contribute to research on circadian biology and its implications for human health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to identify blood-based markers that can inform a clinician or researcher about an individual's internal biological clock. At the broad levels of society and public health research, the work has the potential direct benefit of identifying individuals with ""off-set"" clocks (enabling diagnosis and potential therapy), increasing accuracy and precision of studies of blood lipids, facilitating understanding of certain sleep disorders, increasing understanding of the role of biological clocks in chronic disease processes (e.g., cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease), and potentially improving the administration of certain pharmaceuticals, eg, chemotherapy agents.        ","Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting",9083622,R01HL132556,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Clocks', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Disease', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Memory', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Strigiformes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker panel', 'blood lipid', 'blood-based biomarker', 'chemotherapy', 'combinatorial', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'human population study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'meetings', 'men', 'metabolomics', 'older women', 'personalized medicine', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'real world application', 'tool', 'vehicular accident']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2016,848973,327644200,0.007310376192513312
"Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this research is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). Currently, more than 28 million Americans have impaired hearing and approximately 75% of these persons are over the age of 55. The prevalence of presbycusis will increase substantially with the aging of the population. To meet the challenges of this most common chronic condition of aging, improved diagnostic methods, treatment approaches, and prevention strategies will be of great importance. To meet these objectives, four research projects are proposed. Project 1 assesses age-related changes in human cochlear and neural function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies. Project 2 examines the impact of metabolic and sensory presbycusis and aging on brain structure and functional networks that support speech recognition. Project 3 identifies genetic variations causing an increased susceptibility to age-related hearing loss using DNA samples from older adults in our study and defines their pathological consequences in human temporal bones. Project 4 studies adult stem cell dependency on the cochlear extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment using animal models of metabolic presbycusis and ECM deficiency, and observations of cochlear tissues from human temporal bones. A central goal is to relate changes observed in animal models of metabolic presbycusis to declines in hearing in older humans. In parallel with this goal, results from the large battery of tests obtained from participants in our longitudinal study (Human Subjects Core) will be analyzed to further define and validate phenotypes of age-related hearing loss. Thus, four interrelated research projects, supported by large numbers of well-characterized human subjects and a detailed database of cross-sectional and longitudinal data, form a cohesive program that addresses fundamental questions on human presbycusis. The Clinical Research Center is unique in several respects, including its 25-year longitudinal study of  hearing in older persons, the diversity of basic, translational, and clinical approaches, and its focus on a disorder that contributes to poor communication abilities and reduced quality of life for millions of older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Clinical Research Center leverages the multidisciplinary and wide-ranging expertise in each project, and the wealth of information available in the human subject database, to generate new knowledge on the high prevalence public health problem of age-related hearing loss. Our goals are to reduce its prevalence, slow its progression, and develop new prevention, diagnostic, and treatments strategies to improve communication and quality of life of older adults.      Subproject 1  Defining Phenotypes of Age-Related Hearing Loss  Lead Investigator: Judy R. Dubno, Ph.D.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complex genetic and environmental factors affecting human hearing over the lifespan contribute to a large variation in audiometric profiles and suprathreshold measures of auditory function. As a result, determining mechanisms of age-related hearing loss in older adults is challenging because genetic, age, noise history, injury, disease, medication, diet, and other factors can work independently and jointly to alter human auditory function. Although morphologic findings from older humans are limited to postmortem data, experimental procedures with animals of known heredity can disrupt specific cochlear systems, model certain pathologic conditions, and introduce or minimize environmental exposures, while measuring subsequent changes in auditory function. Consistent with results from animal models linking audiometric profiles to specific cochlear pathologies, such as metabolic or sensory loss, audiograms from the Clinical Research Center's human subject database (Core B) were classified into four audiometric phenotypes, which provided a means to characterize the pathophysiology of hearing loss in older humans. Audiometric phenotypes determined using supervised machine learning classifiers were consistent with expected demographic and noise history patterns that segregate with patterns of hearing loss. Project 1 will refine and further validate these phenotyping methods using suprathreshold measures of cochlear and neural function beyond the audiogram that characterize metabolic and sensory presbyacusis, and the additive effects of morphologic and functional neural loss. To meet this goal Aim 1.1 tests the hypothesis that older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis differ in cochlear nonlinearities and lower frequency suprathreshold auditory function. Aim 1.2 tests the hypothesis that changes in auditory nerve activity result in unique and additive effects in older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis. Thus, Project 1 will assess age- related changes in auditory function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies and link findings to Project 2, focused on central auditory and cortical changes, and to translational Projects 3 and 4, which will determine the genetic and cellular mechanisms of age-related hearing loss using humans and human tissue. With these approaches, morphologic and physiologic changes characterizing metabolic, sensory, and neural presbyacusis provide a framework for assessing and interpreting age-related changes in human auditory function.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Knowledge of the variations in pathophysiology underlying human age-related hearing loss may dictate different diagnostic test batteries, hearing-aid fitting  algorithms, auditory-training regimens, and recommendations for communication strategies. This new information will lead to better diagnosis and treatments for this high-prevalence public health concern, and improved communication and quality of life for millions of older adults.",Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis,9012784,P50DC000422,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heredity', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical shape', 'Physiological', 'Predisposition', 'Presbycusis', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Structure', 'Temporal bone structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adult stem cell', 'age related', 'aging population', 'hearing impairment', 'human subject', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'support network', 'treatment strategy']",NIDCD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,P50,2016,2214679,136810522,0.0052584257644916685

"Administrative Supplement to 1R03MH105765: Neuropsychiatric Classification via Connectivity and Machine Learning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The diagnostic system for neuropsychiatric conditions embodied in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM) is based on clusters of symptoms rather than on underlying etiology or pathophysiology. The establishment of reliable diagnoses was a critical step in the advancement of psychiatric science three decades ago, but now it holds the field back by concealing relationships between brain biology and individual patients' symptoms - relationships that are obscure under the best of circumstances. This realization motivates a search for an alternative, brain-based diagnostic system, in the form of the NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative. The development of such an alternative diagnostic framework is in its infancy, and new strategies are needed for the rational categorization of pathophysiological states.  We have successfully used data-driven analysis of functional connectivity data, derived from functional neuroimaging of the brain at rest. This approach has revealed neural dysconnectivity across several neuropsychiatric conditions. We will apply these data-driven approaches, in conjunction with leading machine learning algorithms, to quantify dysconnectivity patterns across and within major DSM disorders.  We have assembled a dataset of 707 resting-state scans, performed on state-of-the-art 3T scanners and passing rigorous quality control standards, comprising five major DSM diagnoses: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder, with matched controls for each. Accompanying symptom assessments were administered by highly skilled personnel. This large hybrid dataset permits an unprecedented cross-diagnostic, data-driven search for shared or distinct dysconnectivity across diagnoses. Specifically, we will employ a powerful multi-tiered analytic approach using: fully data-driven connectivity analysis, focusing on networks defined a priori by work in healthy subjects, and a seed-based approach focused on circuits associated with the constituent DSM diagnoses.  We hypothesize several possible outcomes. First, patient groups derived from the data-driven connectivity analyses may indeed map onto symptom-based DSM diagnoses. This would be a validation of a symptom- focused nosology, at least across these conditions. Second, data-driven analysis may identify new categories that cut across DSM diagnoses. Third, results may follow continua of dysconnectivity, such as those proposed by the RDoC framework. A more complex outcome that blends these patterns is also probable. Finally, emergent patterns will be correlated against symptom measures, within and across disorders.  Irrespective of the ultimate pattern, results of this project will critically inform ongoing effort to refine a diagnostic scheme for psychiatric disorders that is firmly grounded in their pathophysiology.

"QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tissue identification and quantification plays a significant role in the study of aging and age-related diseases. For example, the accumulation of fat in the human body and its regional distribution with aging is associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Changes in muscle composition are strongly linked to decline of muscle strength, decreased mobility caused by aging, or musculoskeletal disorders. Especially interesting is analysis of longitudinal changes of morphometric descriptors that is significant for studying the aging process and for the diagnosis and prevention of age-related diseases.  Medical imaging has emerged as a major tool for estimation of body composition mainly due to being non- invasive and producing multi-dimensional information. Nowadays MRI and CT acquisition is a central component of clinical trials. An abundance of imaging data is collected, but this wealth of information has not been utilized to full extent. Therefore research on image analysis techniques for tissue quantification that are reproducible and can be used on large-scale clinical trials is of particular importance.  The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse body composition data from modern MRI and CT imaging. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that qualitative body composition phenotypes on clinical imaging will differentiate individuals who are healthy versus those who are not. The goal of our work is to provide a foundation for image analysis of the abdomen and lower extremities and to study the relationship between body morphological changes and age-related pathologies.  We will build upon recent advances in medical image computing to segment muscle, regional adipose tissue, and bone in clinical CT and MRI scans. We will also develop image registration procedures to achieve intra- and inter-subject correspondence and make efficient use of information provided by multi-modal and multi-temporal imaging data collected in clinical trials (aim 1). After these methods have been developed, we will address the hypothesis that quantitative use of clinical imaging can increase the prognostic accuracy of age-related pathologies (aim2).          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age-related diseases such as type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and sarcopenia have become a worldwide epidemic and affect the quality of life of millions. To give a global perspective, roughly 343.8 million people in the world have type-2 diabetes today, and 175 million don't know they have diabetes at all. Metabolic diseases are strongly linked to longitudinal changes in body composition, morphology and function. This project will contribute novel and non-invasive medical image analysis techniques for studying the human body composition and its changes with increasing age to achieve timely prognosis of these pathologies.                 ",QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES,8854343,SC3GM113754,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delaware', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Role', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Techniques', 'Thigh structure', 'Tissues', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age related', 'biophysical model', 'bone', 'effective therapy', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'morphometry', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'sarcopenia', 'statistics', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY,SC3,2015,63363,4139254,-0.007931231969643222
"Neuropsychiatric Classification via Connectivity and Machine Learning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The diagnostic system for neuropsychiatric conditions embodied in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM) is based on clusters of symptoms rather than on underlying etiology or pathophysiology. The establishment of reliable diagnoses was a critical step in the advancement of psychiatric science three decades ago, but now it holds the field back by concealing relationships between brain biology and individual patients' symptoms - relationships that are obscure under the best of circumstances. This realization motivates a search for an alternative, brain-based diagnostic system, in the form of the NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative. The development of such an alternative diagnostic framework is in its infancy, and new strategies are needed for the rational categorization of pathophysiological states.  We have successfully used data-driven analysis of functional connectivity data, derived from functional neuroimaging of the brain at rest. This approach has revealed neural dysconnectivity across several neuropsychiatric conditions. We will apply these data-driven approaches, in conjunction with leading machine learning algorithms, to quantify dysconnectivity patterns across and within major DSM disorders.  We have assembled a dataset of 707 resting-state scans, performed on state-of-the-art 3T scanners and passing rigorous quality control standards, comprising five major DSM diagnoses: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder, with matched controls for each. Accompanying symptom assessments were administered by highly skilled personnel. This large hybrid dataset permits an unprecedented cross-diagnostic, data-driven search for shared or distinct dysconnectivity across diagnoses. Specifically, we will employ a powerful multi-tiered analytic approach using: fully data-driven connectivity analysis, focusing on networks defined a priori by work in healthy subjects, and a seed-based approach focused on circuits associated with the constituent DSM diagnoses.  We hypothesize several possible outcomes. First, patient groups derived from the data-driven connectivity analyses may indeed map onto symptom-based DSM diagnoses. This would be a validation of a symptom- focused nosology, at least across these conditions. Second, data-driven analysis may identify new categories that cut across DSM diagnoses. Third, results may follow continua of dysconnectivity, such as those proposed by the RDoC framework. A more complex outcome that blends these patterns is also probable. Finally, emergent patterns will be correlated against symptom measures, within and across disorders.  Irrespective of the ultimate pattern, results of this project will critically inform ongoing effort to refine a diagnostic scheme for psychiatric disorders that is firmly grounded in their pathophysiology. Furthermore, the methodology will be applicable to other datasets. We anticipate that this approach will provide a key pillar to the development of a brain-based understanding of the heterogeneity of psychiatric disease.

"Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neurological diseases occur in the absence of neurodegenerative pathology, such as neurotransmission disorders. Deficient neurotransmission is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, deterioration in synaptic function also appears during ageing, accompanied by a decline in cognitive and behavioral function. Synaptic strength and plasticity, important in cognitive functions such as memory, are affected by synaptic activity. However, the regulators of synaptic strength, either activity-dependent or independent, are far from understood. Here, I propose to explore how environmental cues and ageing can affect synaptic morphology in the nematode C. elegans, and how this correlates to synaptic function and activity. In C. elegans, which is an excellent model for neuroscience, synaptic sites can be observed with fluorescent fusion proteins. However, fluorescently labeled synaptic sites are small and faint, and obtaining large number of high-content data poses many experimental limitations. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate regulators of synaptic function through multidimensional morphological profiling of synaptic sites. This work is composed of a mentored and an independent research phase. During the mentored phase, I will develop tools that allow high-throughput quantitative multidimensional profiling of synaptic morphology in large populations of animals. These tools are based on combining microfluidics, automation, and computer vision methods for image analysis, which enable streamlined quantitative morphological characterization of synaptic sites. In addition to this, tools to determine synaptic function in the motor circuit through the quantification of locomotive activity and controlled stimulation of excitatory neurons will be developed to correlate synaptic morphology to function. The mentored phase will also include extensive training in various aspects: technology development, biology and neuroscience, and career development. The scientific environment at the institution of the mentored phase is highly collaborative and provides excellent support in terms of facilities and intellectual opportunities. During the independent research phase, I plan to apply the developed tools during the mentored phase to uncover how environmental cues can affect synaptic function through activity dependent or independent mechanisms. I will also utilize these tools to study synaptic decline during aging, and how exposure to environmental regulators of synaptic function during development can alter synaptic decline during aging. In this way, we will be able to address a biological question unapproachable with conventional methods. This approach is innovative not only because the technology developed will greatly increase the throughput and quality of characterization, but also because it proposes studying the links between form and function in synaptic sites. This project is significant because it will enable streamlined morphological studies in neuroscience, which should lead to uncovering pathways, genes and potential therapies for synaptic function deficiencies due to disease or age-related decline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Defective neurotransmission is the cause of many neurological diseases ranging from depression to autism. Understanding the regulators of synaptic strength can shed light on pathways that play a role in establishing healthy synaptic function, and treatments for neurotransmission-related diseases.",Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization,8775624,K99AG046911,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Descriptor', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institution', 'Ion Channel', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Cleft', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'career development', 'cognitive function', 'excitatory neuron', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'neurotransmitter release', 'neurotransmitter uptake', 'normal aging', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'synaptic function', 'technology development', 'tissue fixing', 'tool']",NIA,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2015,90000,45341731,0.008130076317410952
"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,8935820,K01ES025442,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2015,146944,607172798,0.017463348234548974
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,8849802,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'human CCL26 protein', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2015,156324,507546965,-0.002289415916197279
"Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The quest for fast image acquisition speed has always been a perennial topic in the MRI community. To reduce the acquisition time for maximal spatial and temporal resolution, modern MRI protocols usually perform reduced acquisitions below the Nyquist rate. The reduced data is then used to reconstruct the image through advanced reconstruction techniques that leverage some prior information about the MRI system (e.g., parallel imaging) and/or MR signal (e.g., compressed sensing). Since such prior information is patient and system specific, recent techniques obtain the prior information using training data obtained through an empirical calibration procedure. All existing methods assume the prior models are linear. Since the intrinsic nonlinear relationship in the training data cannot be characterized in such simple models, the reconstruction is degraded by the inaccuracy of the prior information. Nonlinear learning from the training data have proven to be more powerful in machine learning because it is more general and includes the linear model as a special case. However, it is usually more challenging to learn the nonlinear models and even more challenging to incorporate the model in reconstruction due to the increased degree of freedom. We recently have introduced a novel concept of ""kernel"" in MR reconstruction to address the above challenges timely. Our preliminary results on parallel imaging and sparsity-constrained reconstruction demonstrate that the kernel-based algorithms improve the reconstruction quality over the original algorithms with linear prior models. Built upon our strong preliminary results, the objective of this application is to develop an innovative kernel-based framework for MR image reconstruction from undersampled data. This framework does not require explicit knowledge of nonlinear mapping (as in preliminary work) such that a broader family of nonlinear functions can be explored for different clinical applications. The proposed work is expected to advance the field of MR image reconstruction vertically. Specifically, the successful completion of the proposed project will result in a general framework leading to many new algorithms (including two developed in this project) for reconstruction from reduced acquisition. Therefore, virtually all of current clinical MRI could benefit from the improved resolution, image quality, and/or reduced acquisition times that the new framework will facilitate or the novel applications i may enable.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is to develop a general framework and two specific new techniques to improve the spatial resolution and/or reduce the scan time in magnetic resonance imaging and evaluate the performance of the techniques for 3D parallel imaging and quantitative imaging in brain. The development of such novel fast imaging techniques may greatly enhance diagnosis of neurological disease. Therefore the project will potentially benefit numerous subjects and the healthcare system.            ",Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling,8953102,R21EB020861,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Family', 'Freedom', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-linear Models', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R21,2015,180330,73424103,-0.012774695083696073
"Intrinsic Cortical Networks and Cognitive Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson's disease (PD) affects 1% of adults over age 65. While traditionally defined by motor symptoms, up to 75% of PD patients will eventually develop dementia making it the leading cause of nursing home placement in this population. Although there is currently no cure for PD, our ability to treat motor symptoms has advanced tremendously since the 1960's based on advances in our understanding of motor symptom neurophysiology. I propose that the treatment and prevention of dementia in PD may also prove possible through advances in our understanding of the neurophysiology of cognitive dysfunction. I will use modern network theory as a theoretical and mathematical framework for this endeavor. My long-term goal is to advance our fundamental understanding of the neurophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in PD to provide empirically testable models, clinically relevant biomarkers, and novel therapeutic targets. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that patterns of cortical functional connectivity critical to normal cognitive function are disruptd by subcortical pathology in PD and that interventions which normalize these patterns will improve cognition. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data presented in this proposal and other previously published work. The research objectives of this proposal are to further our understanding of how cortical connectivity relates to cognitive dysfunction in PD, develop a novel biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in PD based on cortical physiology and to determine whether modulation of cortical connectivity may result in cognitive improvements in PD. We will accomplish the objectives of this proposal through three Specific Aims: 1) Determine whether graph theory measures of functional cortical activity measured with magneto encephalography (MEG) are associated with cognitive dysfunction in PD subjects with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI); 2) Develop a novel state-defining biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in PD based on MEG features through a machine learning approach; and 3) Determine the effects of repetitive trans cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on MEG measures of cortical connectivity and cognitive outcomes in PD-MCI patients. The approach is innovative because it represents the first study to apply graph theory measures to understanding the relationship of cortical physiology and cognitive dysfunction in PD; the first study to apply machine learning approaches to cognitive PD biomarker development; and the first clinical trial or mechanistic study of rTMS in PD-MCI. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in PD and will provide biomarkers and pilot data essential to planning future therapeutic interventions. The training objectives and related research activities of this proposal will provide new skills, manuscripts and pilot data related to advanced MEG analysis, graph theory, biomarker development and rTMS trials necessary to establish my independence in these areas and obtain R01 funding to advance this unique research program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dementia is the leading cause of nursing home placement in Parkinson's disease (PD) yet little is known about the cause(s) of cognitive dysfunction in PD and there are no effective treatments. Our preliminary data and other published studies suggest that abnormalities in brain activity involving networks important for normal thinking and memory may contribute to cognitive dysfunction in PD and may represent a target for treatment. This proposal will identify abnormalities in cortical activity related to cognitive dysfunction in PD usng magneto encephalography and will perform a randomized control trial of frontal repetitive trans cranial magnetic stimulation to determine the therapeutic potential of modulating this brain activity.",Intrinsic Cortical Networks and Cognitive Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease,8853346,K02NS080885,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Cephalic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Elderly', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nursing Homes', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Rest', 'Symptoms', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'effective therapy', 'encephalography', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'physiologic model', 'programs', 'screening', 'skills', 'theories', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K02,2015,186354,292134808,0.026167089478867787
"A Strength Analysis Tool for Studying Healthy Aging via Exercise in C. elegans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exercise is arguably the most potent approach we can take to defer physical decline associated with aging and to protect against late onset diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. Molecular understanding of how exercise benefits translate into healthy aging is thus of definitive medical interest. We study fundamental processes relevant to healthy aging in the 959-celled nematode C. elegans. Recently we made a fascinating discovery-C. elegans can exercise (swim) to exhibit training benefits, and appear to gain benefits by molecular pathways conserved in humans. Our initial model development opens up a new research area for understanding how tissue-specific and organism-wide health benefits are induced by exercise, and creates a novel paradigm for identifying exercise mimetic drugs that might promote healthy aging. To really harvest the potential of this model, we need to measure the strength of the tiny C. elegans. We collaborated to develop a strength test in which trained animals thread through a matrix of deformable pillars, and the extent of pillar deflection is used to calculate force. Our ""NemaFlex"" force detection device is the quantitative foundation with which we expect to break new ground in understanding exercise impact on healthy aging. Here we propose required development to enhance assay throughput and pursue applications that will not only anchor this technology as an essential component of C. elegans exercise evaluation but also accelerate studies on exercise biology and healthy aging in this powerful model. Aim 1 is to develop a novel high throughput tool for direct strength evaluation in C. elegans.  This aim will generate an essential tool for analysis of C. elegans strength at multiple life stages, define the exercise regimen that will become the anchor protocol in the field, and reveal features of training in this model. Aim 2 is to use NemaFlex to evaluate exercise mimetic drugs & to facilitate focused pilot genetic screens. This aim will establish critical proof-of-principle for genetic and drug discovery using the NemaFlex. Aim 3 is to initiate dissection of the functional and molecular relationship between exercise and healthy aging, grounded in NemaFlex force measures of training benefits.  To begin, we will test how optimized strength training tracks with a broad spectrum of healthspan indicators that decline with age, we will investigate impact of cessation of training on aging quality, and we will ask if exercise mimetic drugs extend healthspan in the absence of training. Our goals will create novel technology that for the first time permits facile quantitativ analysis of exercise adaptations in the powerful C. elegans genetic model. Accomplishment of our tractable aims will anchor a new subfield of genetic investigation of exercise and healthy aging that may influence design of interventions that broadly promote health and defer aging.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Exercise has a profound positive impact on health of the aging population in that it protects against age-associated diseases including cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, at the same time it maintains muscle, immune system, and nervous system function in aging. We are developing the first exercise model in the simple animal C. elegans, in which training benefits appear mediated by conserved mechanisms and exercise promotes healthy aging. We will optimize a novel tool for direct strength measurement of these tiny 959-celled animals and show how our device can facilitate searches for exercise mimetic drugs and genes that are associated with training adaptations, and can also help define exercise impact on a broad range of healthy aging measures. The experimental advantages of C. elegans may yield unexpected insights that inspire development of novel interventions that protect against age-associated disease and age-associated decline.              ",A Strength Analysis Tool for Studying Healthy Aging via Exercise in C. elegans,8936078,R21AG050503,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biology of Aging', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Muscle', 'Muscle function', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pump', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Staging', 'Swimming', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Work', 'aging population', 'anti aging', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'fascinate', 'healthy aging', 'immune function', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'mimetics', 'model development', 'new technology', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'strength training', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NIA,TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,235630,5488393,-0.008513665615117271
"Neural Mechanisms of Aging Stereotypes on Cognition ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project uses neuroimaging to enrich our understanding of the impact of negative aging stereotypes on cognitive performance in older adults - a phenomenon known as ""stereotype threat"". We will identify task-related brain activity associated with stereotype threat, and the extent to which individual beliefs in memory ability, stereotype self-relevance, and anxiety mediate these neural effects. We also will test two hypothesized mechanisms of threat, using traditional fMRI methods and novel pattern classifier techniques. This project will inform theories of ageist stereotype threat at the psychological and neural level, which is critical for disentangling the effects of aging-related neural decline and social factors on brain activity. The impact of stereotype threat on cognitive tests has significan public health implications, not only for cognitive functioning in daily life, but because cognitive tests are used to diagnose the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease. To the extent that threat impairs performance on these tests, an individual's true cognitive ability would be underestimated. In our study, cognitively normal older adults will be explicitly exposed to negative stereotypes about aging memory (threat condition) or a positive, age-fair framing of the task (control condition). Next, during fMRI, they will take a recollection task known to be sensitive to aging stereotype threat effects. The neural mechanisms of stereotype threat will be determined by directly comparing brain activity between the threat and control groups, as well as comparisons to brain activity in younger adult groups that are tested in conditions that simulate the cognitive processes thought to drive stereotype threat. In determining which neural mechanisms drive stereotype threat in aging populations, we hope to minimize the negative impact of ageist stereotypes on older adults, in daily cognitive routines and in medical settings where cognitive tests are used for diagnosis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research studies ageist stereotype effects on cognition, using psychological measures and neuroimaging to identify the causes of stereotype effects in different people. Understanding stereotypes can help individuals avoid them, thereby increasing the well-being of older adults.            ",Neural Mechanisms of Aging Stereotypes on Cognition,8868661,R21AG049931,"['Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Automobile Driving', 'Belief', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stereotyping', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age difference', 'age related', 'anxiety states', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'emotion regulation', 'expectation', 'interest', 'mental state', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'sample fixation', 'social', 'theories', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2015,237000,246330700,0.003581622010010805
"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.            ",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,9004826,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mining', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'data mining', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'novel', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,319087,641965656,0.02416399865290204
"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.     What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.     What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented.         Protections for Human Subjects:    Acceptable        Vertebrate Animals:    Not applicable        Resource Sharing:    Acceptable. Data management plan is reasonable. Published data will be shared upon request when practically and ethically possible.        Budget and Period of Support:    Recommend as Requested Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms. By isolating the contribution of  different memory systems to learned choice, this project may help to guide future treatment strategies.",CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions,8926934,R01DA038891,"['Accounting', 'Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Budgets', 'Choice Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Drug abuse', 'Eating Disorders', 'Employee Strikes', 'Episodic memory', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Female', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Midbrain structure', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Vertebrates', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'data management', 'dopamine system', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human subject protection', 'improved', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'outreach', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'role model', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,329880,77336088,0.02247620125653631
"Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Designing an efficient Huntington's disease (HD) early intervention clinical trial for individuals who have an expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene requires identifying and combining clinical, biological, cognitive, and brain imaging markers to accurately distinguish among subjects who will have a diagnosis during a given intervention period and those who will not, and to track early changes in the disease course. The goal of this project is to identify sensitive biomarkers for HD risk stratification, indexing disease progression, and developing clinical trial endpoints. The proposal directly adheres to ""2P's"" of the NIH New Strategic Vision of the ""4P's"" of Medicine: they will offer promising ways to predict when the disease will develop; and increase the capacity to personalize early intervention based on the informative patient-specific markers our models identify. Combining biomarkers to predict HD onset and progression is an essential step in a continuum of research for development of disease-modifying therapies. Composite markers and their risk profiles created from our model will offer quantitative way to monitor and compare potential interventions. Evidence collected from these comparisons will advance the development of efficacy studies in premanifest HD, where neuroprotective treatments would be most beneficial. We develop and apply a series of cutting-edge statistical learning methods based on support vector machine (SVM), variable selection, and dimension reduction to achieve these goals. These modern statistical methods designed for correlated big data have quickly emerged as among the most successful tools for hypothesis generation, classification and prediction in biomedical studies. However, they have not been introduced to HD biomarker research. In aim 1, using counting process, we propose SVM to handle time-to-event outcomes (e.g., time-to-HD-diagnosis) to combine markers into risk scores to discriminate subjects who will experience HD onset in the immediate future from those who will not,  based on their personalized features. Although SVM is well studied for binary outcomes, it is far less explored for time-to-event outcomes. We fill this gap in knowledge. In aim 2, we propose new learning methods for longitudinal outcomes to combine markers that modify the course of HD signs to monitor disease process and distinguish subjects with rapid progression from those with slower progression. In aim 3, we propose to use novel and robust performance measures to compare derived combined markers with existing disease indices and key markers. These aims will fundamentally advance our understanding of markers linked to HD onset and progression. The creation of statistical models for composite markers and risk profiles is especially useful in: (1) offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare potential interventions, and (2) improving power of efficacy studies targeted at premanifest individuals by narrowing the predictive interval which leads to future clinical trials that can be made shorter with fewer subjects. Finally, our improved predictions of HD onset and progression will provide more informative genetic counseling sessions for pre-symptomatic subjects at risk of HD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of Huntington's disease (HD) research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay onset or slow disease progression, and to provide different treatment regimens at each disease stage. To meet this goal, this proposal develops and applies a series of advanced statistical approaches to rank and combine clinical, behavioral, and brain imaging markers to predict HD diagnosis in premanifest subjects during a given time period and to measure disease progression.

"Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurogenic (vasovagal) syncope (VVS) is a significant medical problem. The faint is preceded by a Vasovagal Response (VVR), characterized by a sudden drop in arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). VVS and VVRs are diagnosed using a tilt test, a vestibular stimulus. Despite being relatively common, the neural basis of the VVR and the role of the vestibular system in inducing VVRs are not known. Moreover, there is no small animal model of VVRs. We recently showed that low frequency sinusoidal galvanic vestibular stimulation (sGVS) induces VVRs in anesthetized rats. As in humans, VVRs are also induced in rats by tilt. In the proposed research we will characterize the physiological properties of VVRs in rats, thereby establishing a useful small animal model of human VVRs. We propose that VVRs are induced by strong, repeated stimulation of the vestibulo-sympathetic reflex (VSR), which maintains blood flow to the brain during changes in head position relative to gravity. Aim 1 will characterize the transitions from normal VSR to VVRs using pulses and sinusoids of galvanic stimulation to show that VVRs occur when the VSR is appropriately stimulated. Nose up tilt and Translation-While-Rotating (TWR) will be used to determine the axes of stimulation that are most likely to produce VVRs. Additionally, the low frequency oscillations in HR and BP that are produced by sGVS and tilt reflect activation of Mayer waves, thought to be of fundamental importance in maintaining BP stability. In Aim 2 these oscillations will be modeled using a novel concept in which Mayer wave function is represented by a non-linear relaxation oscillator. In Aim 3, single unit neurophysiological studies in otolith-recipient portions of the caudal vestibular nuclei will identify the functional characteristics and physiological signature of VVR- related neurons. Together, the proposed research will establish a model of VVS, document how the vestibular system controls BP, and demonstrate that VVRs are adaptive compensatory responses that serve to re- equilibrate BP after major perturbations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vasovagal syncope (VVS; unexpected fainting) and vasovagal responses (VVR) are a significant medical problem when they recur frequently; the underlying causes and neural mechanisms that produce such fainting are unknown. We have recently shown that activation of the vestibular system causes arterial blood pressure and heart rate changes in anesthetized rats that are similar to the changes in humans during these faints. In this project, we will characterize the changes in blood pressure and heart rate that are produced by activation of the vestibular system with tilts and galvanic stimulation, model the process that is causing the faints with a novel relaxation oscillator, and investigate the underlying neuronal basis for these responses.",Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response,8807937,R01DC012573,"['Acceleration', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Baroreflex', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Discontinuous Capillary', 'Drops', 'Feedback', 'Force of Gravity', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Reaction', 'Reflex action', 'Refractory', 'Relative (related person)', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Vasovagal', 'Vasovagal Syncope', 'Vestibular nucleus structure', 'Width', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'data modeling', 'falls', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'operation', 'otoconia', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'vector']",NIDCD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2015,341436,415711940,0.01258515973334002
"Neural Mechanisms of Fixation Choice while Searching Natural Scenes The overall goal of these experiments is to understand how the brain controls where we look. To accomplish this, it is important to study brain activity and behavior under conditions that closely approximate those in the real world. All of the experiments we propose to do will use awake behaving rhesus monkeys as subjects. In prior work, we have studied activity in the cortical frontal eye field while monkeys looked at images of natural scenes. The frontal eye field (FEF) is closely involved in the control of purposive voluntary eye movements. While the monkey searched for a target hidden in the images of natural scenes, the activity of FEF neurons consisted of combinations of activity related to planning upcoming eye movements, as well as activity that was sensitive to salient visual features of the image. In parallel with the development of our understanding of how the brain controls eye movements, there have been substantial advances in our understanding of the features of natural images that guide both human and monkey eye movements. These behavioral studies are at the advanced level of being able to accurately predict patterns of eye movements. Our goal in this proposal is to take advantage of these advancements in predicting patterns of eye movements in natural environments to help us understand the brain events that are responsible for this behavior. We will focus upon neuron activity in the FEF due to its essential role in the control of voluntary eye movements. The proposal has 3 Aims each focused upon a different factor that is known to guide eye movements under natural conditions. Salience describes how different a small part of a visual scene is from the remainder of the scene based upon stimulus features such as color, contrast, shape, and orientation. Our first aim will define the effects that salience has upon FEF activity. In our second aim, we'll quantify the effects of relevance. Relevance refers to the importance of visual features for the task at hand; for example, if we're looking for a red target, the red items in the image will be more likely to attract our attention and ultimately be the target for an eye movement. Knowing the broad composition of a scene, a quality that is called scene gist, can tell us the places where an object is more likely to be found. For example, if we are looking for a bicycle, we are more likely to search the sidewalks and roadways of a street scene and ignore other places where bicycles are unlikely to be found. Our final aim will look for the effects of scene gist upon monkey behavior and the FEF activity driving that behavior. In addition to the brain recording experiments outlined above, a large part of our effort will be devoted to mathematical analysis and modeling of the behavioral and neuronal data we obtain. Our ultimate goal is to provide a model that predicts the contributions of salience, relevance, and gist to the activity of FEF neurons. The successful model will be a mathematical representation that predicts search-related activity in the FEF for both artificial and real world conditions. Due to the known and expected similarities between monkey and human eye movement systems, these experiments provide a model for the functional organization of frontal eye field cortex in humans. The ability to make appropriate eye movements is a function that can be damaged by a number of diseases, including cerebral stroke, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Schizophrenia. More specifically, deficits in the proper control of fixation during search of complex visual stimuli have been described in patients suffering from simultanagnosia, as well as in individuals with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.",Neural Mechanisms of Fixation Choice while Searching Natural Scenes,8822295,R01EY021579,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory area', 'Banana', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bicycling', 'Brain', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Eye Movements', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Property', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Saccades', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'awake', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'driving behavior', 'expectation', 'frontal eye fields', 'image guided', 'interest', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical model', 'mind control', 'neuromechanism', 'research study', 'sample fixation', 'visual motor', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,376478,66720547,-0.003228644401788222
"Noninvasive imaging-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to establish a strategy that will make neuronal electrical signaling detectable via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a whole-brain level. Our approach is built on the novel concept of using cell-adhesive micron-scale electronic devices to transduce neuronal potentials across the brain into magnetic field fluctuations. As part of our validation of these voltage-sensing microprobes, we also propose to implement a new, scalable method for simultaneous recording of MRI and electrophysiological data. The methods we propose to develop will be broadly applicable to problems in neurobiology, and will transform neuroscientists' ability to study integrative functions of the brain. Our microprobe approach will also help establish a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine and molecular imaging, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology. Recent work has dem- onstrated that micron-scale electrodes, coated with cell-adhesive molecules and juxtaposed against cultured cells allow recording of millivolt-scale action potentials, comparable to intracellular recordings. The current induced in a microelectrode can be converted into a modest, transient magnetic field if it is channeled into an inductor. In Specific Aim 1, we will model the magnetic fields produced by feasible currents in spiral or solenoidal microcoils of defined geometry, compute predicted effects on MRI signal amplitude and phase as a function of microprobe distribution, and fabricate the microprobes themselves. Preliminary calculations indicate that localized, transient fields of about 10 nT could be produced in individual 10-turn microcoils of 1 5m diameter. Magnetic fields of this order are greater than endogenous neuronal fields detected in tech- nologies like magnetoencephalography, and have been shown previously to be measurable by MRI in some contexts. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the ability of our microprobes to report action potentials from neu- ronal populations in MRI. The microdevices wil first be applied to cultured neurons or neural tissue slices and placed in an MRI scanner. Data series will be obtained using multiple protocols to detect variations of MRI signal due to variations in neuronal activity. If experiments in culture are successful, microprobes will be site-specifically injected into the cerebral cortex of anesthetized rats, and tested in an somatosensory stimu- lation paradigm. In Specific Aim 3, we will establish a simultaneous MRI and conventional electrophysiology approach to validate the novel MRI voltage probes directly. Performing electrophysiology in an MRI scanner is complicated by artifacts induced by the scanning hardware, in particular due to switched gradient fields. To circumvent this problem, we will measure neuronal potentials using differential recording from pairs of channels on tetrodes or modified tetrodes. Once the in-scanner recording method has been refined, MRI- based and conventional electrophysiology data will be obtained and compared to assess performance of the voltage-sensing microprobes, and to guide further improvements, if necessary. Noninvasive MRI-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices will have high impact in biology, and specifically in brain research, both through applications to the study of neurological disease and as tools for the analysis of neural network function in basic neuroscience. The microprobes we propose to develop represent a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology.",Noninvasive imaging-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices,8850914,R01NS076462,"['Action Potentials', 'Adhesives', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bathing', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Caliber', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Chemicals', 'Child Development', 'Contralateral', 'Contrast Media', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Education', 'Electrodes', 'Electronics', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Electroplating', 'Engineering', 'Feedback', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incubators', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Organism', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain research', 'density', 'design', 'electrical potential', 'improved', 'information processing', 'magnetic field', 'molecular imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural stimulation', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'research study', 'sensor', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'voltage']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2015,392217,113554200,0.027124826780071443
"4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging allows safe, non-invasive measurement of brain structures and functions and their changes over time. This has led to many longitudinal studies to discover imaging biomarkers for better prediction of brain disorders. However, the associated longitudinal changes are often tiny within a short follow-up time, and are thus difficult to detect by conventional methods since the measurement errors could be larger than the actual changes. Also, with the significant increase of data with longitudinal follow-ups, it becomes challenging to capture a small set of effective imaging biomarkers from large data for accurate disease prediction. This issue becomes even more critical when there is missing data in the longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. The goal of this renewal project is to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. These tools wil allow elucidating subtle abnormal changes that would be otherwise left undetected with existing tools. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will create a novel multi-atlas guided 4D brain labelling method for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject. All longitudinal images of each subject will be first aligned by a novel groupwise 4D registration algorithm that can more accurately estimate longitudinal deformations. Then, these aligned longitudinal images can be further registered with multiple atlases guided by a graph that locally connects all (subject and atlas) images, thus obtaining more accurate/consistent registration and ROI labeling for the longitudinal images of same subject. In Aim 2, we will further create a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model to effectively integrate serial imaging and non-imaging biomarkers for early diagnosis and prediction of brain status. Also, to further extract effective biomarkers, a new machine learning technique, called deep learning, will be adapted to learn high-level features for helping prediction with a novel temporally-constrained group sparse learning method, which is able to predict clinical scores consistently for future time-points. Finally, in Aim 3, we will create nove methods to deal with missing data in longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. In particular, we will first develop several data completion methods (including matrix completion) to complete the missing data. Then, instead of designing a single predictor that may be limited, we will design multiple diverse predictors (by multi-task learning) for ensemble prediction, thus significantly increasing the overall prediction performance. Also, considering that the individual's future images are not available at early time-points, to improve the clinical utility of the proposed methods, we will apply our models to various cases with different numbers of longitudinal images and then further train them jointly to achieve the overall best performance. Note that the performance of all proposed methods will be evaluated in this project for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) study, although they are also applicable to studies of other brain disorders.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel multi-atlases guided 4D brain labelling framework for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across the longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject by harnessing the manifold of anatomical variation of 4D image and the atlases, 2) a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model that will automatically learn the relevant information from imaging and non-imaging data of past time-points to predict future status of brain, and 3) novel methods for missing data completion and then multiple diverse predictors for ensemble prediction. We will also make these methods practical for clinical diagnostics setting. Finally, we will package all our methods into a softwar tool and release it publicly, as we have done before. The methods that we will develop can find their applications not only in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that will be used as example in this project, but also in other fields such as longitudinal monitoring of other neurological diseases (i.e., schizophrenia) and measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain.            ",4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease,8814543,R01EB008374,"['4D Imaging', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Schizophrenia', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2015,477101,511185245,-0.017135297644644505
"Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging provides a safe, non-invasive measurement of the whole brain, and has enabled large clinical and research studies for brain development, aging, and disorders. However, many disorders, i.e., major neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alteration, which are often difficult to identify visually and compare over time. To address this critical issu, in the renewal phase of this project, we will continue to work with GE Research to develop and disseminate a software package for brain measurement, comparison, and diagnosis. The new tools include 1) a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases-based segmentation method for precise measurement of brain alteration patterns, and 2) novel pattern classification and regression methods for early detection and longitudinal monitoring of brain disorders. Aims. Currently, most existing atlas-based labeling methods simply warp each atlas independently to the individual brain for multi-atlases-based structural labeling. This could lead to 1) inaccurate labeling due to possible large registration error when the atlases are very different from the target individual brain, and 2) inconsistent labeling of the same brain structure across different individuals due to independent labeling of each individual brain. The first goal of this project is hence to develop a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases -based segmentation method for simultaneous registration and joint labeling of all individual brains by concurrent consideration of all atlases. With measurements of brain structures and their alteration patterns, univariate analysis methods are often used to understand how the disease affects brain structure and function at a group level. Although this can lead to better understanding of neurological pathology of brain disorders, more sophisticated image analysis methods are urgently needed for quantitative assessment and early diagnosis of brain abnormality at an individual level. Thus, the second goal of this project is to develop various novel machine learning methods for early diagnosis of brain disorders and better quantification of brain abnormality at an individual level. Specifically, we will take Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia, as an example for demonstrating the performance of our proposed methods in early diagnosis of AD, as well as in prediction of long-term outcomes of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The last goal of this project is to build, for ou developed methods, the respective software modules for the 3D Slicer (a free open-source software package with a flexible modular platform for medical image analysis and visualization, http://www.slicer.org/), to promote the potential clinical applications by using tools in 3D Slicer for preprocessing of patient data and our tools for diagnosis. Again, this software development work will be performed in collaboration with our current collaborator, GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) that is focused on developing 3D Slicer. Both source code and pre-compiled programs will be made freely available. Applications. These methods can find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormality of neurological diseases (i.e., AD and schizophrenia), measuring effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between structural and cognitive function variables. Description of Project This project aims to develop a novel method for accurate measurement of brain structure and function by groupwise registration and joint labeling of all individual images via multiple manual-labeled atlases. Moreover, several novel tools for brain abnormality measurement will also be developed for early detection and progression monitoring of brain disorders using both multimodal imaging and non-imaging data. By successful development of these brain measurement tools, the respective software modules will be developed and further incorporated into 3D Slicer via collaboration with GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC).

"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We will use a novel statistical approach to develop and validate the models.",Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler,8839318,R01NS082304,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anterior', 'Anterior Horn Cells', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Natural History', 'Neuraxis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Riluzole', 'Spinal', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'screening', 'spinal tract', 'treatment trial']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,577490,641965656,-0.00038123332877853584
"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.            ",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,8963132,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Controlled Study', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2015,593802,146629556,0.01768316713774747
"Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate mapping of normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and premature neonates is a key factor in the early detection of developmental disorders as well as understanding how external factors can influence early brain growth. The combination of fast multi-slice MRI techniques with computer vision algorithms has recently provided the ability to reliably image 3D brain structure in-utero providing valuable information inaccessible to ultrasound imaging. To complement this new structural information, recently there has been increasing interest in the use of functional MR imaging (fMRI) to map the development of resting state brain function in children, premature neonates and, most recently, fetuses in-utero. This work has revealed signs of a predictable developmental path in the formation of resting state patterns of brain activity present in adults and abnormalities in these patterns in children have been linked with neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions in later life. Such fMRI methods, previously used in adults and children, could provide a unique new window into functional activity in the developing fetal brain. However, the imaging techniques required suffer from an important limitation for use in the fetus: they make use of repeated acquisitions where subtle changes in MR signal provide the measure of interest. Fetal head motion within the scanner perturbs both measurement location and signal level due to the changing relationship between fetal anatomy, maternal anatomy and the scanner. Based on our preliminary results, in this proposal we plan to develop a set of new signal and geometry correction methods specifically for fetal fMRI that combine novel acquisition techniques with post-processing algorithms to provide a new route to addressing these unique problems. This will allow us to collect the first accurate functional MRI data from a range of un-sedated fetuses in ages and activity levels seen in clinical studies. We will develop and validate these methods together with complementary pattern analysis techniques specifically aimed at motion scattered data and employ them to build the first combined 4D structure-function map of brain development in-utero. This will show for the first time the temporal and spatial relationship between structural changes and the development of resting state patterns of brain activity covering the critical age of first clinical MRI scan and the following period of cortical folding. his will help answer such questions as: which tissue zones of the fetal brain such activity begins, and whether the functional patterns are related to the timing of the formation of specific cortical folds. We will collect a range of data that captures fetuses both at different ages and different states of activity representing those seen in typical clinical studies, and in addition collect valuable outcome measures on the babies after birth against which in-utero measure will be evaluated. We release the data to the community as a whole in the form of an open-access 4D atlas. This combined structure-function data will provide a unique new reference for both neuroscience and, in the longer term, clinical evaluation of brain health during pregnancy and premature birth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinically, improved in-utero evaluation of the fetal brain is a key concern for obstetricians and pediatricians in managing complex pregnancies and there is also now an increasing public health awareness of the influence of the in-utero environment, in terms of factors such as stress and diet, on long-term health in adult life. Functional connectivit imaging of the brain in childhood has revealed the presence of early markers of later cognitive and neuropsychological problems. The ability to map these same properties in utero, promises to provide a rich set of very specific early markers that can be used to understand the impact of the in-utero environment on brain function and feasibly provide a route to the use of early neuro-protective agents and procedures early in childhood.",Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero,8856234,R01EB017133,"['Accounting', 'Acoustic Stimulation', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Movement', 'Fetus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Prematurity of fetus', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protective Agents', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in utero', 'interest', 'neonate', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'population based', 'premature', 'research clinical testing', 'spatial relationship', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2015,614823,533302350,0.012989776697985685
"Computer-aided detection of focal cortical dysplasias ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project proposes to build computer-aided detection (CAD) software for use in identifying cortical malformations known as focal cortical dysplasia's (FCDs), which are a common cause of epileptic seizures. The intent is for the software, used by a neuroradiologist at a clinical workstation, to decrease the time- intensive nature of the visual search for cortical dysplasia's, while simultaneously increasing sensitivity o dysplasia identification, thus reducing the number of missed lesions and making neuroradiologists more effective and more efficient.  Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures, that exacts a large toll upon society in terms of both quality of life and health care costs. Malformations of cortical development (MCD) are the most common cause of seizures in children and the second most common cause in adults. Focal cortical dysplasia is a common form of MCD that is responsible for the vast majority of treatment resistant epilepsy in patients with MCD, and when anti-epileptic medication is ineffective, detection of FCD becomes critical to the ability of the epilepsy team to offer surgery which is often these patient's last hope for seizure freedom.  Unfortunately, the radiological diagnosis of FCD is exceedingly difficult in a large percentage of cases due to their focal and subtle nature. Thus, while resection of these dysplasias can often cure seizures, they can be missed for years or decades, resulting in increased neurological damage and degradation of quality of life due to chronic seizures. In principle high resolution MRI can be used to increase diagnostic accuracy. While this is becoming more common in clinical practice, the need for high patient throughput, lack of clinical information and inexperience often results i these lesions being missed on routine clinical reads by neuroradiologists.  The project will build upon a foundation of existing technology for the generation of quantitative measures of the human brain based on MRI imaging, known in the neuroimaging research domain as FreeSurfer. The project will make use of an MRI dataset of 100 subjects with histologically-confirmed FCD to be labeled by four neuroradiologists, and control subjects with epilepsy that is not due to FCD. The project has three aims: gathering the dataset and expansion of the detection algorithms tested in Phase I to include additional MRI biomarkers; development of an MRI scanner slice prescription component to ensure imaging of an FCD at the optimal visualization plane; and an aim to submit a commercialized version of FreeSurfer for FDA 510(k) clearance. The latter aim is important for the long-term project goal of advancing the state of other clinical detection methods through the building of additional CAD tools making use of FreeSurfer's brain measures, including diseases as varied as Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, tumor monitoring and hydrocephalus.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposal is to build software for computer-aided detection of focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs), a malformation of brain development that is a common cause of epileptic seizures in children and adults. The proposed software will offer a neuroradiologist a faster and more accurate detection method compared to visual inspection only. By identifying abnormalities otherwise missed, the ensuing surgical removal of an abnormality can often stop seizures.            ",Computer-aided detection of focal cortical dysplasias,8903251,R44NS083101,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Back', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Cortical Dysplasia', 'Cortical Malformation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Formulations', 'Dysplasia', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Equipment', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Freedom', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Seizures', 'Slice', 'Societies', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Vendor', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'brain malformation', 'clinical practice', 'computer aided detection', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'gray matter', 'interest', 'migration', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'vector', 'visual search', 'white matter']",NINDS,"CORTICOMETRICS, LLC",R44,2015,750677,733415,-0.049924041733491326
"Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this research is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). Currently, more than 28 million Americans have impaired hearing and approximately 75% of these persons are over the age of 55. The prevalence of presbycusis will increase substantially with the aging of the population. To meet the challenges of this most common chronic condition of aging, improved diagnostic methods, treatment approaches, and prevention strategies will be of great importance. To meet these objectives, four research projects are proposed. Project 1 assesses age-related changes in human cochlear and neural function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies. Project 2 examines the impact of metabolic and sensory presbycusis and aging on brain structure and functional networks that support speech recognition. Project 3 identifies genetic variations causing an increased susceptibility to age-related hearing loss using DNA samples from older adults in our study and defines their pathological consequences in human temporal bones. Project 4 studies adult stem cell dependency on the cochlear extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment using animal models of metabolic presbycusis and ECM deficiency, and observations of cochlear tissues from human temporal bones. A central goal is to relate changes observed in animal models of metabolic presbycusis to declines in hearing in older humans. In parallel with this goal, results from the large battery of tests obtained from participants in our longitudinal study (Human Subjects Core) will be analyzed to further define and validate phenotypes of age-related hearing loss. Thus, four interrelated research projects, supported by large numbers of well-characterized human subjects and a detailed database of cross-sectional and longitudinal data, form a cohesive program that addresses fundamental questions on human presbycusis. The Clinical Research Center is unique in several respects, including its 25-year longitudinal study of  hearing in older persons, the diversity of basic, translational, and clinical approaches, and its focus on a disorder that contributes to poor communication abilities and reduced quality of life for millions of older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Clinical Research Center leverages the multidisciplinary and wide-ranging expertise in each project, and the wealth of information available in the human subject database, to generate new knowledge on the high prevalence public health problem of age-related hearing loss. Our goals are to reduce its prevalence, slow its progression, and develop new prevention, diagnostic, and treatments strategies to improve communication and quality of life of older adults.      Subproject 1  Defining Phenotypes of Age-Related Hearing Loss  Lead Investigator: Judy R. Dubno, Ph.D.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complex genetic and environmental factors affecting human hearing over the lifespan contribute to a large variation in audiometric profiles and suprathreshold measures of auditory function. As a result, determining mechanisms of age-related hearing loss in older adults is challenging because genetic, age, noise history, injury, disease, medication, diet, and other factors can work independently and jointly to alter human auditory function. Although morphologic findings from older humans are limited to postmortem data, experimental procedures with animals of known heredity can disrupt specific cochlear systems, model certain pathologic conditions, and introduce or minimize environmental exposures, while measuring subsequent changes in auditory function. Consistent with results from animal models linking audiometric profiles to specific cochlear pathologies, such as metabolic or sensory loss, audiograms from the Clinical Research Center's human subject database (Core B) were classified into four audiometric phenotypes, which provided a means to characterize the pathophysiology of hearing loss in older humans. Audiometric phenotypes determined using supervised machine learning classifiers were consistent with expected demographic and noise history patterns that segregate with patterns of hearing loss. Project 1 will refine and further validate these phenotyping methods using suprathreshold measures of cochlear and neural function beyond the audiogram that characterize metabolic and sensory presbyacusis, and the additive effects of morphologic and functional neural loss. To meet this goal Aim 1.1 tests the hypothesis that older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis differ in cochlear nonlinearities and lower frequency suprathreshold auditory function. Aim 1.2 tests the hypothesis that changes in auditory nerve activity result in unique and additive effects in older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis. Thus, Project 1 will assess age- related changes in auditory function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies and link findings to Project 2, focused on central auditory and cortical changes, and to translational Projects 3 and 4, which will determine the genetic and cellular mechanisms of age-related hearing loss using humans and human tissue. With these approaches, morphologic and physiologic changes characterizing metabolic, sensory, and neural presbyacusis provide a framework for assessing and interpreting age-related changes in human auditory function.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Knowledge of the variations in pathophysiology underlying human age-related hearing loss may dictate different diagnostic test batteries, hearing-aid fitting  algorithms, auditory-training regimens, and recommendations for communication strategies. This new information will lead to better diagnosis and treatments for this high-prevalence public health concern, and improved communication and quality of life for millions of older adults.",Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis,8786533,P50DC000422,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heredity', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical shape', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Presbycusis', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Structure', 'Temporal bone structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adult stem cell', 'age related', 'hearing impairment', 'human subject', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'treatment strategy']",NIDCD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,P50,2015,2302752,136810522,0.0052584257644916685

"Synapse Elimination during Development: Pruning Rates, Models, and Diseases     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neural circuits are formed using a two-stage developmental process that includes an initial period of exuberant synapse formation, followed by a longer period of activity-dependent synapse elimination. While pruning has been well-documented in many organisms and brain regions, little attention has been paid to the rate at which synapses are eliminated during development. Different pruning rates have a strong effect on the quality and plasticity of the resulting neural circuits, and indeed, many neurological diseases have been linked to abnormal synapse levels in the cortex during critical developmental periods.  We hypothesize that pruning rates in the cortex have been optimized to achieve both connectivity and robustness of underlying neural circuits. To test our hypothesis, we propose a joint experimental-computational research plan to explore how synapse levels change during development and how these changes manifest at the network and phenotypic levels. First, we will quantify the precise rate of synapse elimination during development of the mouse barrel cortex using a specialized electron microscopy (EM) preparation that selectively stains for synapses. We will develop a fully-automated and high-throughput image processing pipeline that will allow us to count tens of thousands of synapses per time point and gain robust statistics of pruning rates and the time of peak synapse density. Second, we will develop computational models of synaptic pruning to evaluate how pruning rates affect information processing in neural circuits. Our computational experiments will explore how sparse circuits emerge that are capable of efficient and robust encoding, while still being flexible enough for plasticity and adaptation and while meeting metabolic costs. Our models will also help us answer questions about global neural circuitry, including whether hubs are likely to exist and how functional modules are formed. Third, we will examine cases of synapse rewiring and reorganization following abnormal developmental conditions. We will repeat our EM procedure using mouse models of Fragile X syndrome and Rett syndrome to compare synapse levels with respect to control, and we will extend our computational models to understand circuit-level differences in these conditions.  The proposed project will generate new computational and experimental solutions for analyzing network development and will lead to biological insights into how local pruning mechanisms affect global circuit properties.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Many neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Fragile X syndrome (Autism) and Rett syndrome, are believed to be caused by faulty developmental processes in the brain. To understand precisely when and how these changes manifest, it is important a) to quantify synapse levels in the brain over time in fast, automated, and scalable ways and b) to create models of how these changes affect circuit processing and function. Together, these approaches can help identify critical periods for diagnosing neurodevelopmental disorders and aid with their early detection and treatment.","Synapse Elimination during Development: Pruning Rates, Models, and Diseases",8722888,F32MH099784,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Targeting', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Onset of illness', 'Organism', 'Plastics', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Solutions', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Telecommunication Network', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Vertebral column', 'barrel cortex', 'base', 'computational network modeling', 'cost', 'critical developmental period', 'critical period', 'density', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'information processing', 'insight', 'meetings', 'mouse development', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'synaptogenesis', 'wireless network']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,F32,2014,8990,30434536,-0.0072758013820280526
"Neuropsychiatric Classification via Connectivity and Machine Learning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The diagnostic system for neuropsychiatric conditions embodied in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM) is based on clusters of symptoms rather than on underlying etiology or pathophysiology. The establishment of reliable diagnoses was a critical step in the advancement of psychiatric science three decades ago, but now it holds the field back by concealing relationships between brain biology and individual patients' symptoms - relationships that are obscure under the best of circumstances. This realization motivates a search for an alternative, brain-based diagnostic system, in the form of the NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative. The development of such an alternative diagnostic framework is in its infancy, and new strategies are needed for the rational categorization of pathophysiological states.  We have successfully used data-driven analysis of functional connectivity data, derived from functional neuroimaging of the brain at rest. This approach has revealed neural dysconnectivity across several neuropsychiatric conditions. We will apply these data-driven approaches, in conjunction with leading machine learning algorithms, to quantify dysconnectivity patterns across and within major DSM disorders.  We have assembled a dataset of 707 resting-state scans, performed on state-of-the-art 3T scanners and passing rigorous quality control standards, comprising five major DSM diagnoses: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder, with matched controls for each. Accompanying symptom assessments were administered by highly skilled personnel. This large hybrid dataset permits an unprecedented cross-diagnostic, data-driven search for shared or distinct dysconnectivity across diagnoses. Specifically, we will employ a powerful multi-tiered analytic approach using: fully data-driven connectivity analysis, focusing on networks defined a priori by work in healthy subjects, and a seed-based approach focused on circuits associated with the constituent DSM diagnoses.  We hypothesize several possible outcomes. First, patient groups derived from the data-driven connectivity analyses may indeed map onto symptom-based DSM diagnoses. This would be a validation of a symptom- focused nosology, at least across these conditions. Second, data-driven analysis may identify new categories that cut across DSM diagnoses. Third, results may follow continua of dysconnectivity, such as those proposed by the RDoC framework. A more complex outcome that blends these patterns is also probable. Finally, emergent patterns will be correlated against symptom measures, within and across disorders.  Irrespective of the ultimate pattern, results of this project will critically inform ongoing effort to refine a diagnostic scheme for psychiatric disorders that is firmly grounded in their pathophysiology. Furthermore, the methodology will be applicable to other datasets. We anticipate that this approach will provide a key pillar to the development of a brain-based understanding of the heterogeneity of psychiatric disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Current psychiatric nosology, embodied in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM), is based on symptom clusters rather than underlying etiology or pathophysiology, which fundamentally limits attempts to develop novel rationally guided and biologically informed interventions. We propose to use neuroimaging measures of functional brain connectivity from multiple DSM disorders to identify fully data- driven patterns of dysconnectivity across and within existing diagnostic entities. The identified patterns will reveal abnormalities in neural network function independent of DSM diagnoses and will critically inform new brain-based diagnostic proposals, such as that envisioned by the NIMH's RDoC initiative.            ",Neuropsychiatric Classification via Connectivity and Machine Learning,8808026,R03MH105765,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Arbitration', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality Control', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Secondary to', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'case control', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cost', 'disease classification', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R03,2014,74072,550947887,-0.005689218087003446
"Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neurological diseases occur in the absence of neurodegenerative pathology, such as neurotransmission disorders. Deficient neurotransmission is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, deterioration in synaptic function also appears during ageing, accompanied by a decline in cognitive and behavioral function. Synaptic strength and plasticity, important in cognitive functions such as memory, are affected by synaptic activity. However, the regulators of synaptic strength, either activity-dependent or independent, are far from understood. Here, I propose to explore how environmental cues and ageing can affect synaptic morphology in the nematode C. elegans, and how this correlates to synaptic function and activity. In C. elegans, which is an excellent model for neuroscience, synaptic sites can be observed with fluorescent fusion proteins. However, fluorescently labeled synaptic sites are small and faint, and obtaining large number of high-content data poses many experimental limitations. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate regulators of synaptic function through  multidimensional morphological profiling of synaptic sites. This work is composed of a mentored and an independent research phase. During the mentored phase, I will develop tools that allow high-throughput quantitative multidimensional profiling of synaptic morphology in large populations of animals. These tools are based on combining microfluidics, automation, and computer vision methods for image analysis, which enable streamlined quantitative morphological characterization of synaptic sites. In addition to this, tools to determine synaptic function in the motor circuit through the quantification of locomotive activity and controlled stimulation of excitatory neurons will be developed to correlate synaptic morphology to function. The mentored phase will also include extensive training in various aspects: technology development, biology and neuroscience, and career development. The scientific environment at the institution of the mentored phase is highly collaborative and provides excellent support in terms of facilities and intellectual opportunities. During the independent research phase, I plan to apply the developed tools during the mentored phase to uncover how environmental cues can affect synaptic function through activity dependent or independent mechanisms. I will also utilize these tools to study synaptic decline during aging, and how exposure to environmental regulators of synaptic function during development can alter synaptic decline during aging. In this way, we will be able to address a biological question unapproachable with conventional methods. This approach is innovative not only because the technology developed will greatly increase the throughput and quality of characterization, but also because it proposes studying the links between form and function in synaptic sites. This project is significant because it will enable streamlined morphological studies in neuroscience, which should lead to uncovering pathways, genes and potential therapies for synaptic function deficiencies due to disease or age-related decline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Defective neurotransmission is the cause of many neurological diseases ranging from depression to autism. Understanding the regulators of synaptic strength can shed light on pathways that play a role in establishing healthy synaptic function, and treatments for neurotransmission-related diseases.",Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization,8618418,K99AG046911,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Descriptor', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institution', 'Ion Channel', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Cleft', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'career development', 'cognitive function', 'excitatory neuron', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'neurotransmitter release', 'neurotransmitter uptake', 'normal aging', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'synaptic function', 'technology development', 'tissue fixing', 'tool']",NIA,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2014,90000,45341731,0.008130076317410952
"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.            ",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,8830000,K01ES025442,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2014,151804,607172798,0.017463348234548974
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,8723038,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'human CCL26 protein', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2014,156324,507546965,-0.002289415916197279
"Intrinsic Cortical Networks and Cognitive Dysfunction in Parkinson???s Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson's disease (PD) affects 1% of adults over age 65. While traditionally defined by motor symptoms, up to 75% of PD patients will eventually develop dementia making it the leading cause of nursing home placement in this population. Although there is currently no cure for PD, our ability to treat motor symptoms has advanced tremendously since the 1960's based on advances in our understanding of motor symptom neurophysiology. I propose that the treatment and prevention of dementia in PD may also prove possible through advances in our understanding of the neurophysiology of cognitive dysfunction. I will use modern network theory as a theoretical and mathematical framework for this endeavor. My long-term goal is to advance our fundamental understanding of the neurophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in PD to provide empirically testable models, clinically relevant biomarkers, and novel therapeutic targets. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that patterns of cortical functional connectivity critical to normal cognitive function are disruptd by subcortical pathology in PD and that interventions which normalize these patterns will improve cognition. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data presented in this proposal and other previously published work. The research objectives of this proposal are to further our understanding of how cortical connectivity relates to cognitive dysfunction in PD, develop a novel biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in PD based on cortical physiology and to determine whether modulation of cortical connectivity may result in cognitive improvements in PD. We will accomplish the objectives of this proposal through three Specific Aims: 1) Determine whether graph theory measures of functional cortical activity measured with magneto encephalography (MEG) are associated with cognitive dysfunction in PD subjects with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI); 2) Develop a novel state-defining biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in PD based on MEG features through a machine learning approach; and 3) Determine the effects of repetitive trans cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on MEG measures of cortical connectivity and cognitive outcomes in PD-MCI patients. The approach is innovative because it represents the first study to apply graph theory measures to understanding the relationship of cortical physiology and cognitive dysfunction in PD; the first study to apply machine learning approaches to cognitive PD biomarker development; and the first clinical trial or mechanistic study of rTMS in PD-MCI. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in PD and will provide biomarkers and pilot data essential to planning future therapeutic interventions. The training objectives and related research activities of this proposal will provide new skills, manuscripts and pilot data related to advanced MEG analysis, graph theory, biomarker development and rTMS trials necessary to establish my independence in these areas and obtain R01 funding to advance this unique research program.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dementia is the leading cause of nursing home placement in Parkinson's disease (PD) yet little is known about the cause(s) of cognitive dysfunction in PD and there are no effective treatments. Our preliminary data and other published studies suggest that abnormalities in brain activity involving networks important for normal thinking and memory may contribute to cognitive dysfunction in PD and may represent a target for treatment. This proposal will identify abnormalities in cortical activity related to cognitive dysfunction in PD usng magneto encephalography and will perform a randomized control trial of frontal repetitive trans cranial magnetic stimulation to determine the therapeutic potential of modulating this brain activity.

"Analytic Methods for Determining Multimodal Biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There has been considerable progress in understanding the biology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Reliable biomarkers are still lacking, however, for early stage detection of PD and for characterizing disease progression. Advances in biotechnology have led to the advent of mental health studies that collect large-scale, multi-dimensional data sets, including brain imaging data, genomic data, and biologic and clinical measures. Such studies provide an unprecedented opportunity for cross-cutting investigations that stand to gain a deeper understanding of PD. A major limiting factor to multidimensional biomarker development, however, is the lack of statistical tools available to accommodate diverse, large-scale data. Leveraging data from neuromelanin magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI) of the locus coeruleus and the substantia nigra, chemical shift imaging (CSI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting-state functional MRI, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analytes, genotype information, and numerous clinical variables, we plan to develop novel statistical techniques to identify multimodal PD biomarkers. Our data provide an unprecedented opportunity for cross-cutting methodological advances in multimodal PD biomarker discovery. Separately, we will consider a massive patient database with nearly 250,000 subscribers in Georgia. Building on our collective expertise in developing statistical and machine-learning methods for large-scale imaging data and in the pathophysiology of PD, we plan to advance methods for PD biomarker analyses and discovery through the following specific aims. First, we plan to develop new statistical techniques to reveal multimodal biomarkers for PD including imaging, clinical, and biologic variables. Secondly, we plan to utilize the massive clinical database to identify clinical risk factors for early stage PD. Thirdly, we will develop software equipped with a friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to implement the multimodal biomarker detection methods.          There is a critical unmet need for the discovery of early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) biomarkers to assist and accelerate the process for conducting clinical trials targeting neuroprotective treatments. Large studies with clinical, molecular, genetic, and neuroimaging measures produce complex multidimensional datasets, which may be useful to help establish such biomarkers. We plan to develop new statistical methods that integrate multiple high-dimensional data sets to identify accurate and robust multimodal biomarkers of PD.

"Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurogenic (vasovagal) syncope (VVS) is a significant medical problem. The faint is preceded by a Vasovagal Response (VVR), characterized by a sudden drop in arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). VVS and VVRs are diagnosed using a tilt test, a vestibular stimulus. Despite being relatively common, the neural basis of the VVR and the role of the vestibular system in inducing VVRs are not known. Moreover, there is no small animal model of VVRs. We recently showed that low frequency sinusoidal galvanic vestibular stimulation (sGVS) induces VVRs in anesthetized rats. As in humans, VVRs are also induced in rats by tilt. In the proposed research we will characterize the physiological properties of VVRs in rats, thereby establishing a useful small animal model of human VVRs. We propose that VVRs are induced by strong, repeated stimulation of the vestibulo-sympathetic reflex (VSR), which maintains blood flow to the brain during changes in head position relative to gravity. Aim 1 will characterize the transitions from normal VSR to VVRs using pulses and sinusoids of galvanic stimulation to show that VVRs occur when the VSR is appropriately stimulated. Nose up tilt and Translation-While-Rotating (TWR) will be used to determine the axes of stimulation that are most likely to produce VVRs. Additionally, the low frequency oscillations in HR and BP that are produced by sGVS and tilt reflect activation of Mayer waves, thought to be of fundamental importance in maintaining BP stability. In Aim 2 these oscillations will be modeled using a novel concept in which Mayer wave function is represented by a non-linear relaxation oscillator. In Aim 3, single unit neurophysiological studies in otolith-recipient portions of the caudal vestibular nuclei will identify the functional characteristics and physiological signature of VVR- related neurons. Together, the proposed research will establish a model of VVS, document how the vestibular system controls BP, and demonstrate that VVRs are adaptive compensatory responses that serve to re- equilibrate BP after major perturbations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vasovagal syncope (VVS; unexpected fainting) and vasovagal responses (VVR) are a significant medical problem when they recur frequently; the underlying causes and neural mechanisms that produce such fainting are unknown. We have recently shown that activation of the vestibular system causes arterial blood pressure and heart rate changes in anesthetized rats that are similar to the changes in humans during these faints. In this project, we will characterize the changes in blood pressure and heart rate that are produced by activation of the vestibular system with tilts and galvanic stimulation, model the process that is causing the faints with a novel relaxation oscillator, and investigate the underlying neuronal basis for these responses.            ",Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response,8624688,R01DC012573,"['Acceleration', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Baroreflex', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Discontinuous Capillary', 'Drops', 'Feedback', 'Force of Gravity', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Head', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Reaction', 'Reflex action', 'Refractory', 'Relative (related person)', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Stimulus', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Vasovagal', 'Vasovagal Syncope', 'Vestibular nucleus structure', 'Width', 'base', 'blood pressure regulation', 'data modeling', 'falls', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'operation', 'otoconia', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'vector']",NIDCD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2014,344886,415711940,0.01258515973334002
"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.  What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.  What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented. Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms. By isolating the contribution of  different memory systems to learned choice, this project may help to guide future treatment strategies.",CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions,8837113,R01DA038891,"['Accounting', 'Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Choice Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Drug abuse', 'Eating Disorders', 'Employee Strikes', 'Episodic memory', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Female', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Midbrain structure', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'dopamine system', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'outreach', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'role model', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,347054,77336088,0.021825146096111525
"Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Designing an efficient Huntington's disease (HD) early intervention clinical trial for individuals who have an expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene requires identifying and combining clinical, biological, cognitive, and brain imaging markers to accurately distinguish among subjects who will have a diagnosis during a given intervention period and those who will not, and to track early changes in the disease course. The goal of this project is to identify sensitive biomarkers for HD risk stratification, indexing disease progression, and developing clinical trial endpoints. The proposal directly adheres to ""2P's"" of the NIH New Strategic Vision of the ""4P's"" of Medicine: they will offer promising ways to predict when the disease will develop; and increase the capacity to personalize early intervention based on the informative patient-specific markers our models identify. Combining biomarkers to predict HD onset and progression is an essential step in a continuum of research for development of disease-modifying therapies. Composite markers and their risk profiles created from our model will offer quantitative way to monitor and compare potential interventions. Evidence collected from these comparisons will advance the development of efficacy studies in premanifest HD, where neuroprotective treatments would be most beneficial. We develop and apply a series of cutting-edge statistical learning methods based on support vector machine (SVM), variable selection, and dimension reduction to achieve these goals. These modern statistical methods designed for correlated big data have quickly emerged as among the most successful tools for hypothesis generation, classification and prediction in biomedical studies. However, they have not been introduced to HD biomarker research. In aim 1, using counting process, we propose SVM to handle time-to-event outcomes (e.g., time-to-HD-diagnosis) to combine markers into risk scores to discriminate subjects who will experience HD onset in the immediate future from those who will not,  based on their personalized features. Although SVM is well studied for binary outcomes, it is far less explored for time-to-event outcomes. We fill this gap in knowledge. In aim 2, we propose new learning methods for longitudinal outcomes to combine markers that modify the course of HD signs to monitor disease process and distinguish subjects with rapid progression from those with slower progression. In aim 3, we propose to use novel and robust performance measures to compare derived combined markers with existing disease indices and key markers. These aims will fundamentally advance our understanding of markers linked to HD onset and progression. The creation of statistical models for composite markers and risk profiles is especially useful in: (1) offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare potential interventions, and (2) improving power of efficacy studies targeted at premanifest individuals by narrowing the predictive interval which leads to future clinical trials that can be made shorter with fewer subjects. Finally, our improved predictions of HD onset and progression will provide more informative genetic counseling sessions for pre-symptomatic subjects at risk of HD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of Huntington's disease (HD) research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay onset or slow disease progression, and to provide different treatment regimens at each disease stage. To meet this goal, this proposal develops and applies a series of advanced statistical approaches to rank and combine clinical, behavioral, and brain imaging markers to predict HD diagnosis in premanifest subjects during a given time period and to measure disease progression. The creation of model for composite markers and risk profiles is useful in offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare interventions and powering clinical trials for premanifest HD individuals.            ",Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.,8721037,U01NS082062,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'CAG repeat', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Early intervention trials', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic screening method', 'Goals', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'affection', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'human Huntingtin protein', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'tool']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2014,359539,558628098,-0.009523001031058288
"Neural Mechanisms of Fixation Choice while Searching Natural Scenes  The overall goal of these experiments is to understand how the brain controls where we look. To accomplish this, it is important to study brain activity and behavior under conditions that closely approximate those in the real world. All of the experiments we propose to do will use awake behaving rhesus monkeys as subjects. In prior work, we have studied activity in the cortical frontal eye field while monkeys looked at images of natural scenes. The frontal eye field (FEF) is closely involved in the control of purposive voluntary eye movements. While the monkey searched for a target hidden in the images of natural scenes, the activity of FEF neurons consisted of combinations of activity related to planning upcoming eye movements, as well as activity that was sensitive to salient visual features of the image. In parallel with the development of our understanding of how the brain controls eye movements, there have been substantial advances in our understanding of the features of natural images that guide both human and monkey eye movements. These behavioral studies are at the advanced level of being able to accurately predict patterns of eye movements. Our goal in this proposal is to take advantage of these advancements in predicting patterns of eye movements in natural environments to help us understand the brain events that are responsible for this behavior. We will focus upon neuron activity in the FEF due to its essential role in the control of voluntary eye movements. The proposal has 3 Aims each focused upon a different factor that is known to guide eye movements under natural conditions. Salience describes how different a small part of a visual scene is from the remainder of the scene based upon stimulus features such as color, contrast, shape, and orientation. Our first aim will define the effects that salience has upon FEF activity. In our second aim, we'll quantify the effects of relevance. Relevance refers to the importance of visual features for the task at hand; for example, if we're looking for a red target, the red items in the image will be more likely to attract our attention and ultimately be the target for an eye movement. Knowing the broad composition of a scene, a quality that is called scene gist, can tell us the places where an object is more likely to be found. For example, if we are looking for a bicycle, we are more likely to search the sidewalks and roadways of a street scene and ignore other places where bicycles are unlikely to be found. Our final aim will look for the effects of scene gist upon monkey behavior and the FEF activity driving that behavior. In addition to the brain recording experiments outlined above, a large part of our effort will be devoted to mathematical analysis and modeling of the behavioral and neuronal data we obtain. Our ultimate goal is to provide a model that predicts the contributions of salience, relevance, and gist to the activity of FEF neurons. The successful model will be a mathematical representation that predicts search-related activity in the FEF for both artificial and real world conditions.  Due to the known and expected similarities between monkey and human eye movement systems, these experiments provide a model for the functional organization of frontal eye field cortex in humans. The ability to make appropriate eye movements is a function that can be damaged by a number of diseases, including cerebral stroke, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Schizophrenia. More specifically, deficits in the proper control of fixation during search of complex visual stimuli have been described in patients suffering from simultanagnosia, as well as in individuals with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.",Neural Mechanisms of Fixation Choice while Searching Natural Scenes,8634100,R01EY021579,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory area', 'Banana', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bicycling', 'Brain', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Eye Movements', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Property', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Saccades', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'awake', 'base', 'driving behavior', 'expectation', 'frontal eye fields', 'interest', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical model', 'mind control', 'neuromechanism', 'research study', 'sample fixation', 'visual motor', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,376478,66720547,-0.003228644401788222
"Noninvasive imaging-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to establish a strategy that will make neuronal electrical signaling detectable via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a whole-brain level. Our approach is built on the novel concept of using cell-adhesive micron-scale electronic devices to transduce neuronal potentials across the brain into magnetic field fluctuations. As part of our validation of these voltage-sensing microprobes, we also propose to implement a new, scalable method for simultaneous recording of MRI and electrophysiological data. The methods we propose to develop will be broadly applicable to problems in neurobiology, and will transform neuroscientists' ability to study integrative functions of the brain. Our microprobe approach will also help establish a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine and molecular imaging, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology. Recent work has dem- onstrated that micron-scale electrodes, coated with cell-adhesive molecules and juxtaposed against cultured cells allow recording of millivolt-scale action potentials, comparable to intracellular recordings. The current induced in a microelectrode can be converted into a modest, transient magnetic field if it is channeled into an inductor. In Specific Aim 1, we will model the magnetic fields produced by feasible currents in spiral or solenoidal microcoils of defined geometry, compute predicted effects on MRI signal amplitude and phase as a function of microprobe distribution, and fabricate the microprobes themselves. Preliminary calculations indicate that localized, transient fields of about 10 nT could be produced in individual 10-turn microcoils of 1 5m diameter. Magnetic fields of this order are greater than endogenous neuronal fields detected in tech- nologies like magnetoencephalography, and have been shown previously to be measurable by MRI in some contexts. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the ability of our microprobes to report action potentials from neu- ronal populations in MRI. The microdevices wil first be applied to cultured neurons or neural tissue slices and placed in an MRI scanner. Data series will be obtained using multiple protocols to detect variations of MRI signal due to variations in neuronal activity. If experiments in culture are successful, microprobes will be site-specifically injected into the cerebral cortex of anesthetized rats, and tested in an somatosensory stimu- lation paradigm. In Specific Aim 3, we will establish a simultaneous MRI and conventional electrophysiology approach to validate the novel MRI voltage probes directly. Performing electrophysiology in an MRI scanner is complicated by artifacts induced by the scanning hardware, in particular due to switched gradient fields. To circumvent this problem, we will measure neuronal potentials using differential recording from pairs of channels on tetrodes or modified tetrodes. Once the in-scanner recording method has been refined, MRI- based and conventional electrophysiology data will be obtained and compared to assess performance of the voltage-sensing microprobes, and to guide further improvements, if necessary.         Noninvasive MRI-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices will have high impact in biology, and specifically in brain research, both through applications to the study of neurological disease and as tools for the analysis of neural network function in basic neuroscience. The microprobes we propose to develop represent a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology.

"Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging provides a safe, non-invasive measurement of the whole brain, and has enabled large clinical and research studies for brain development, aging, and disorders. However, many disorders, i.e., major neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alteration, which are often difficult to identify visually and compare over time. To address this critical issu, in the renewal phase of this project, we will continue to work with GE Research to develop and disseminate a software package for brain measurement, comparison, and diagnosis. The new tools include 1) a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases-based segmentation method for precise measurement of brain alteration patterns, and 2) novel pattern classification and regression methods for early detection and longitudinal monitoring of brain disorders. Aims. Currently, most existing atlas-based labeling methods simply warp each atlas independently to the individual brain for multi-atlases-based structural labeling. This could lead to 1) inaccurate labeling due to possible large registration error when the atlases are very different from the target individual brain, and 2) inconsistent labeling of the same brain structure across different individuals due to independent labeling of each individual brain. The first goal of this project is hence to develop a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases -based segmentation method for simultaneous registration and joint labeling of all individual brains by concurrent consideration of all atlases. With measurements of brain structures and their alteration patterns, univariate analysis methods are often used to understand how the disease affects brain structure and function at a group level. Although this can lead to better understanding of neurological pathology of brain disorders, more sophisticated image analysis methods are urgently needed for quantitative assessment and early diagnosis of brain abnormality at an individual level. Thus, the second goal of this project is to develop various novel machine learning methods for early diagnosis of brain disorders and better quantification of brain abnormality at an individual level. Specifically, we will take Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia, as an example for demonstrating the performance of our proposed methods in early diagnosis of AD, as well as in prediction of long-term outcomes of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The last goal of this project is to build, for ou developed methods, the respective software modules for the 3D Slicer (a free open-source software package with a flexible modular platform for medical image analysis and visualization, http://www.slicer.org/), to promote the potential clinical applications by using tools in 3D Slicer for preprocessing of patient data and our tools for diagnosis. Again, this software development work will be performed in collaboration with our current collaborator, GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) that is focused on developing 3D Slicer. Both source code and pre-compiled programs will be made freely available. Applications. These methods can find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormality of neurological diseases (i.e., AD and schizophrenia), measuring effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between structural and cognitive function variables.          Description of Project This project aims to develop a novel method for accurate measurement of brain structure and function by groupwise registration and joint labeling of all individual images via multiple manual-labeled atlases. Moreover, several novel tools for brain abnormality measurement will also be developed for early detection and progression monitoring of brain disorders using both multimodal imaging and non-imaging data. By successful development of these brain measurement tools, the respective software modules will be developed and further incorporated into 3D Slicer via collaboration with GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC).

"Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate mapping of normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and premature neonates is a key factor in the early detection of developmental disorders as well as understanding how external factors can influence early brain growth. The combination of fast multi-slice MRI techniques with computer vision algorithms has recently provided the ability to reliably image 3D brain structure in-utero providing valuable information inaccessible to ultrasound imaging. To complement this new structural information, recently there has been increasing interest in the use of functional MR imaging (fMRI) to map the development of resting state brain function in children, premature neonates and, most recently, fetuses in-utero. This work has revealed signs of a predictable developmental path in the formation of resting state patterns of brain activity present in adults and abnormalities in these patterns in children have been linked with neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions in later life. Such fMRI methods, previously used in adults and children, could provide a unique new window into functional activity in the developing fetal brain. However, the imaging techniques required suffer from an important limitation for use in the fetus: they make use of repeated acquisitions where subtle changes in MR signal provide the measure of interest. Fetal head motion within the scanner perturbs both measurement location and signal level due to the changing relationship between fetal anatomy, maternal anatomy and the scanner. Based on our preliminary results, in this proposal we plan to develop a set of new signal and geometry correction methods specifically for fetal fMRI that combine novel acquisition techniques with post-processing algorithms to provide a new route to addressing these unique problems. This will allow us to collect the first accurate functional MRI data from a range of un-sedated fetuses in ages and activity levels seen in clinical studies. We will develop and validate these methods together with complementary pattern analysis techniques specifically aimed at motion scattered data and employ them to build the first combined 4D structure-function map of brain development in-utero. This will show for the first time the temporal and spatial relationship between structural changes and the development of resting state patterns of brain activity covering the critical age of first clinical MRI scan and the following period of cortical folding. his will help answer such questions as: which tissue zones of the fetal brain such activity begins, and whether the functional patterns are related to the timing of the formation of specific cortical folds. We will collect a range of data that captures fetuses both at different ages and different states of activity representing those seen in typical clinical studies, and in addition collect valuable outcome measures on the babies after birth against which in-utero measure will be evaluated. We release the data to the community as a whole in the form of an open-access 4D atlas. This combined structure-function data will provide a unique new reference for both neuroscience and, in the longer term, clinical evaluation of brain health during pregnancy and premature birth.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinically, improved in-utero evaluation of the fetal brain is a key concern for obstetricians and pediatricians in managing complex pregnancies and there is also now an increasing public health awareness of the influence of the in-utero environment, in terms of factors such as stress and diet, on long-term health in adult life. Functional connectivit imaging of the brain in childhood has revealed the presence of early markers of later cognitive and neuropsychological problems. The ability to map these same properties in utero, promises to provide a rich set of very specific early markers that can be used to understand the impact of the in-utero environment on brain function and feasibly provide a route to the use of early neuro-protective agents and procedures early in childhood.                ",Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero,8688242,R01EB017133,"['Accounting', 'Acoustic Stimulation', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Movement', 'Fetus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Prematurity of fetus', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protective Agents', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'interest', 'neonate', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'population based', 'premature', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'spatial relationship', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2014,602789,533302350,0.012989776697985685
"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We will use a novel statistical approach to develop and validate the models.            ",Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler,8695570,R01NS082304,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anterior', 'Anterior Horn Cells', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Natural History', 'Neuraxis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Riluzole', 'Spinal', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'spinal tract', 'treatment trial']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2014,616625,641965656,-0.00038123332877853584
"Manipulating Neural Tissue with Ultra-Short Laser Pulses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We seek to renew our joint discovery and technology based bioengineering research partnership (BRP).  Our program advances the use of amplified ultrashort laser pulses as a tool to manipulate living and histological tissue.  This unique technology, pioneered by the BRP team, permits tissue to be cut on the micrometer scale by light-fueled plasma-meditated ablation.  Cutting occurs without thermal damage and can be combined with spectroscopic feedback to identify and limit the region being perturbed.  We advance this technology in new ways, including the use of temporal focusing for deep ablation, and apply it to three key test beds.  The first is construction of the angiotome, i.e., a complete vectorized map of cortical vasculature; here we use plasma mediated ablation to automate a form of block-face imaging along with novel algorithms to filter and vectorize features in the data.  The second is the study of neuronal viability in response to perturbations of subcortical blood flow; here we use plasma-mediated ablation to block flow in individual targeted microvessels that lie below the cortical surface.  The third test bed is the automation of cranial and spinal surgery; we combine plasma-mediated ablation with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy to cut bone yet avoid injury to soft tissue.  These investigations are particularly relevant to diagnosing and understanding microinfarctions, i.e., damage to the brain as the result of damage to single cortical vessels, that accumulate with age and trauma.        Program Director (Last, first, middle): Kleinfeld, David, Kaufhold, John and Squier, Jeffrey. These studies advance the use of light to image and manipulate the flow of blood in the brain. We make use of rats and mice as model systems for our experiments. The new capabilities from the proposed work hold two promises for advances in medicine: One is an understanding of micro- infarctions - lesions of individual blood vessels in cortex that lead to the death of brain cells- that accrue with age and trauma. The second is an understanding of the normal patterns of blood flow throughout the brain, which provide the basis for interpreting medical images of brain function.",Manipulating Neural Tissue with Ultra-Short Laser Pulses,8729873,R01EB003832,"['3-Dimensional', 'Ablation', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Beds', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Cessation of life', 'Craniotomy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Fluorescence', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Laminectomy', 'Lasers', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Organelles', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Ursidae Family', 'Veins', 'Work', 'arteriole', 'base', 'bone', 'brain cell', 'capillary', 'design', 'hemodynamics', 'meetings', 'millimeter', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'second harmonic', 'soft tissue', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2014,812810,524978793,0.01799544212304463
"Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this research is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). Currently, more than 28 million Americans have impaired hearing and approximately 75% of these persons are over the age of 55. The prevalence of presbycusis will increase substantially with the aging of the population. To meet the challenges of this most common chronic condition of aging, improved diagnostic methods, treatment approaches, and prevention strategies will be of great importance. To meet these objectives, four research projects are proposed. Project 1 assesses age-related changes in human cochlear and neural function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies. Project 2 examines the impact of metabolic and sensory presbycusis and aging on brain structure and functional networks that support speech recognition. Project 3 identifies genetic variations causing an increased susceptibility to age-related hearing loss using DNA samples from older adults in our study and defines their pathological consequences in human temporal bones. Project 4 studies adult stem cell dependency on the cochlear extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment using animal models of metabolic presbycusis and ECM deficiency, and observations of cochlear tissues from human temporal bones. A central goal is to relate changes observed in animal models of metabolic presbycusis to declines in hearing in older humans. In parallel with this goal, results from the large battery of tests obtained from participants in our longitudinal study (Human Subjects Core) will be analyzed to further define and validate phenotypes of age-related hearing loss. Thus, four interrelated research projects, supported by large numbers of well-characterized human subjects and a detailed database of cross-sectional and longitudinal data, form a cohesive program that addresses fundamental questions on human presbycusis. The Clinical Research Center is unique in several respects, including its 25-year longitudinal study of  hearing in older persons, the diversity of basic, translational, and clinical approaches, and its focus on a disorder that contributes to poor communication abilities and reduced quality of life for millions of older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Clinical Research Center leverages the multidisciplinary and wide-ranging expertise in each project, and the wealth of information available in the human subject database, to generate new knowledge on the high prevalence public health problem of age-related hearing loss. Our goals are to reduce its prevalence, slow its progression, and develop new prevention, diagnostic, and treatments strategies to improve communication and quality of life of older adults.      Subproject 1  Defining Phenotypes of Age-Related Hearing Loss  Lead Investigator: Judy R. Dubno, Ph.D.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complex genetic and environmental factors affecting human hearing over the lifespan contribute to a large variation in audiometric profiles and suprathreshold measures of auditory function. As a result, determining mechanisms of age-related hearing loss in older adults is challenging because genetic, age, noise history, injury, disease, medication, diet, and other factors can work independently and jointly to alter human auditory function. Although morphologic findings from older humans are limited to postmortem data, experimental procedures with animals of known heredity can disrupt specific cochlear systems, model certain pathologic conditions, and introduce or minimize environmental exposures, while measuring subsequent changes in auditory function. Consistent with results from animal models linking audiometric profiles to specific cochlear pathologies, such as metabolic or sensory loss, audiograms from the Clinical Research Center's human subject database (Core B) were classified into four audiometric phenotypes, which provided a means to characterize the pathophysiology of hearing loss in older humans. Audiometric phenotypes determined using supervised machine learning classifiers were consistent with expected demographic and noise history patterns that segregate with patterns of hearing loss. Project 1 will refine and further validate these phenotyping methods using suprathreshold measures of cochlear and neural function beyond the audiogram that characterize metabolic and sensory presbyacusis, and the additive effects of morphologic and functional neural loss. To meet this goal Aim 1.1 tests the hypothesis that older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis differ in cochlear nonlinearities and lower frequency suprathreshold auditory function. Aim 1.2 tests the hypothesis that changes in auditory nerve activity result in unique and additive effects in older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis. Thus, Project 1 will assess age- related changes in auditory function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies and link findings to Project 2, focused on central auditory and cortical changes, and to translational Projects 3 and 4, which will determine the genetic and cellular mechanisms of age-related hearing loss using humans and human tissue.

"Assessment of Gene Effects on the Brain and Disease Risk through Machine Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several neuroimaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are becoming increasingly important for diagnostic classification, prognostic evaluation and tracking treatment response in patients with brain disorders. They provide detailed, quantitative information about brain structure and function, and aspects of ongoing disease processes. Measures derived from these neuroimaging modalities have been studied through automated algorithms as potential predictors of disease outcomes. This proposal aims to introduce and evaluate new computerized algorithms, based on the field of machine learning that would incorporate not only brain imaging measures, but also biochemical and genetic information to create more powerful predictions of diagnostic and prognostic outcomes. Such novel, automated, multimodal predictors, we propose, may have important applications in future clinical decision making and clinical trial design. Brain imaging offers new quantitative measures that may be closer than cognitive assessments to the underlying biological mechanisms that lead to disease. By studying the associations of genetic factors with phenotypes based on cutting edge imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we plan to examine mechanistically meaningful genetic contributions to brain disorders. The rapidly expanding field of neuroimaging genetics will provide the nexus for the applicant's intensive training in the world-class imaging and genetics programs at the UCLA School of Medicine. This proposal will introduce new automated algorithms for gene discovery and risk prediction into the field of neuroimaging genetics. Algorithms that consider multiple genetic variants jointly, we propose, are likely to (1) more powerfully detect new gene effects on brain images, and (2) identify profiles of candidate genetic variants to assist prediction of an individual's brain integrity and risk for disease.       Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability across the world. By developing new computerized models for the prediction of clinical outcomes based on disease-specific neuroimaging, biochemical and genetic biomarkers as well as the early prediction of white matter integrity based on genetic profiles, we hope to pave the way to personalized prevention and management of brain disorders.",Assessment of Gene Effects on the Brain and Disease Risk through Machine Learning,8448904,F30AG041681,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anisotropy', 'Back', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Photons', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized', 'design', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'endophenotype', 'gene discovery', 'gene interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'molecular imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'response', 'time interval', 'treatment response', 'white matter', 'working group']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F30,2013,47232,673201228,0.024342012766365856
"Synapse Elimination during Development: Pruning Rates, Models, and Diseases     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neural circuits are formed using a two-stage developmental process that includes an initial period of exuberant synapse formation, followed by a longer period of activity-dependent synapse elimination. While pruning has been well-documented in many organisms and brain regions, little attention has been paid to the rate at which synapses are eliminated during development. Different pruning rates have a strong effect on the quality and plasticity of the resulting neural circuits, and indeed, many neurological diseases have been linked to abnormal synapse levels in the cortex during critical developmental periods.  We hypothesize that pruning rates in the cortex have been optimized to achieve both connectivity and robustness of underlying neural circuits. To test our hypothesis, we propose a joint experimental-computational research plan to explore how synapse levels change during development and how these changes manifest at the network and phenotypic levels. First, we will quantify the precise rate of synapse elimination during development of the mouse barrel cortex using a specialized electron microscopy (EM) preparation that selectively stains for synapses. We will develop a fully-automated and high-throughput image processing pipeline that will allow us to count tens of thousands of synapses per time point and gain robust statistics of pruning rates and the time of peak synapse density. Second, we will develop computational models of synaptic pruning to evaluate how pruning rates affect information processing in neural circuits. Our computational experiments will explore how sparse circuits emerge that are capable of efficient and robust encoding, while still being flexible enough for plasticity and adaptation and while meeting metabolic costs. Our models will also help us answer questions about global neural circuitry, including whether hubs are likely to exist and how functional modules are formed. Third, we will examine cases of synapse rewiring and reorganization following abnormal developmental conditions. We will repeat our EM procedure using mouse models of Fragile X syndrome and Rett syndrome to compare synapse levels with respect to control, and we will extend our computational models to understand circuit-level differences in these conditions.  The proposed project will generate new computational and experimental solutions for analyzing network development and will lead to biological insights into how local pruning mechanisms affect global circuit properties.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Many neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Fragile X syndrome (Autism) and Rett syndrome, are believed to be caused by faulty developmental processes in the brain. To understand precisely when and how these changes manifest, it is important a) to quantify synapse levels in the brain over time in fast, automated, and scalable ways and b) to create models of how these changes affect circuit processing and function. Together, these approaches can help identify critical periods for diagnosing neurodevelopmental disorders and aid with their early detection and treatment.                ","Synapse Elimination during Development: Pruning Rates, Models, and Diseases",8527041,F32MH099784,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Targeting', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Onset of illness', 'Organism', 'Plastics', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Solutions', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Telecommunication Network', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Vertebral column', 'barrel cortex', 'base', 'computational network modeling', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'critical developmental period', 'critical period', 'density', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'information processing', 'insight', 'meetings', 'mouse development', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'statistics', 'synaptogenesis', 'wireless network']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,F32,2013,52190,30434536,-0.0072758013820280526
"The Role of LFP Spatial Structure in the Hippocampus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this work is to understand how the activity of neurons is coordinated within the hippocampus, a brain region involved in the storage of memories. One manifestation of this coordination is the local field potential (LFP), the summed electrical activity of a small volume of neural tissue. Recently, multi- electrode arrays (MEAs) have enabled the simultaneous measurement of LFPs and single-neuron activity from multiple sites within the brain of an animal as it performs a task. This advance motivates the development of new computational methods that can identify the relationships that exist within these rich, large data sets. The temporal structure of hippocampal LFPs is known to correlate with single-neuron activity, as well as with behavioral state. In contrast, the spatial structure of these LFPs remains relatively unexplored. An interesting example of this spatial structure are the traveling LFP waves that propagate through the hippocampus. This project will examine whether the spatial dynamics of the hippocampal LFP influence neuronal activity and its relationship to behavior. Its aims are 1) to identify a parsimonious model for explaining the observed spatio- temporal structure in the LFP; 2) to investigate the relationship of LFP structure to single-neuron activity; and 3) to understand how LFP structure governs circuit-level neuronal processing within the hippocampus. To achieve these goals, this project will employ statistical learning techniques to extract spatio-temporal regularities from within the LFP, and use predictive models to examine the influence of different LFP structures on the population activity of hippocampal neurons. This work will identify concise metrics that capture the richness of high-dimensional hippocampal LFP measurements. Furthermore, it will examine the utility of incorporating complex dynamical features into current models of hippocampal processing. This work may help understand how distortions in electrical activity within the hippocampus lead to conditions such as epilepsy and amnesia. It will evaluate the suitability of the LFP as a direct target for neuroprosthetic interventions. Finally, it may lead to screening procedures for rapidly finding potential abnormalities in patients' brain activity, and help understand the implications of such abnormalities for patients' lifestyles.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a more complete description of the electrical waves of activity found in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that stores memories. These waves exhibit spatial patterns that may help guide the proper function of the hippocampus. This work could potentially explain how distortions in electrical activity relate to defects in people's abilities to form and recall memories.

"Analytic Methods for Determining Multimodal Biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There has been considerable progress in understanding the biology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Reliable biomarkers are still lacking, however, for early stage detection of PD and for characterizing disease progression. Advances in biotechnology have led to the advent of mental health studies that collect large-scale, multi-dimensional data sets, including brain imaging data, genomic data, and biologic and clinical measures. Such studies provide an unprecedented opportunity for cross-cutting investigations that stand to gain a deeper understanding of PD. A major limiting factor to multidimensional biomarker development, however, is the lack of statistical tools available to accommodate diverse, large-scale data. Leveraging data from neuromelanin magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI) of the locus coeruleus and the substantia nigra, chemical shift imaging (CSI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting-state functional MRI, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analytes, genotype information, and numerous clinical variables, we plan to develop novel statistical techniques to identify multimodal PD biomarkers. Our data provide an unprecedented opportunity for cross-cutting methodological advances in multimodal PD biomarker discovery. Separately, we will consider a massive patient database with nearly 250,000 subscribers in Georgia. Building on our collective expertise in developing statistical and machine-learning methods for large-scale imaging data and in the pathophysiology of PD, we plan to advance methods for PD biomarker analyses and discovery through the following specific aims. First, we plan to develop new statistical techniques to reveal multimodal biomarkers for PD including imaging, clinical, and biologic variables. Secondly, we plan to utilize the massive clinical database to identify clinical risk factors for early stage PD. Thirdly, we will develop software equipped with a friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to implement the multimodal biomarker detection methods.          There is a critical unmet need for the discovery of early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) biomarkers to assist and accelerate the process for conducting clinical trials targeting neuroprotective treatments. Large studies with clinical, molecular, genetic, and neuroimaging measures produce complex multidimensional datasets, which may be useful to help establish such biomarkers. We plan to develop new statistical methods that integrate multiple high-dimensional data sets to identify accurate and robust multimodal biomarkers of PD.

"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,8593988,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'human CCL26 protein', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2013,156324,507546965,-0.002289415916197279
"Integrating Multimodal Brain Imaging Data to Assess Subtle Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional neuroimaging studies of the human brain have become increasingly important in the understanding of normal and pathological processes of cognition. Sophisticated statistical analytic frameworks have been developed to locate signal change and define brain networks involved in various tasks. However, in subtle cognitive impairment-e.g., exposure-related illness, early stages of degenerative diseases, injury, secondary illness following adjuvant therapy for cancer-these methods tend to have low sensitivity for detecting small changes in brain states resulting from mild brain dysfunction. An understanding of disease mechanism or progression of subtle cognitive dysfunction requires a novel statistical analytic framework with improved sensitivity to measure small changes in brain states. We have developed an innovative methodology that we successfully applied in measures of regional cerebral blood flow experiments. These methods use well established spatial modeling procedures, new to the functional brain imaging field, to derive statistically optimal spatial summaries within effective resolution groups or ""kriging"", shown by preliminary studies to improve signal detection sensitivity and mitigate the multiple testing burden. Within this new spatial modeling framework, we propose to extend the kriging methodology to fMRI and EEG, modify existing techniques for characterizing brain networks of connectivity (e.g., kriging-based independent components analysis), and integrate the imaging modalities using a statistical classifier based on derived inputs of data driven effective resolution groups. Our primary goal is to develop this analysis framework to provide insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms of mild cognitive dysfunction. Achieving this goal may suggest treatments to alleviate symptoms, prevent progression, or at minimum, provide an informed clinical management of cognitively impaired patients.        Cognitive impairment is a major health concern, affecting people of all ages. Causes range from traumatic injury to toxin exposures, including chemotherapy for cancer treatment, to degenerative diseases. Mechanisms of damage or disease remain difficult to establish using current methods in functional brain imaging studies due to an inability to measure very small changes in brain states. We propose a new analytic framework using existing technology to improve the ability to measure subtle changes important in the understanding of disease pathology of impaired cognition and to greatly facilitate the integration of information from several imaging modalities with potential implications for clinical management and treatment.

"Intrinsic Cortical Networks and Cognitive Dysfunction in Parkinson???s Disease  7. Project Summary/Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) affects 1% of adults over age 65. While traditionally defined by motor symptoms, up to 75% of PD patients will eventually develop dementia making it the leading cause of nursing home placement in this population. Although there is currently no cure for PD, our ability to treat motor symptoms has advanced tremendously since the 1960's based on advances in our understanding of motor symptom neurophysiology. I propose that the treatment and prevention of dementia in PD may also prove possible through advances in our understanding of the neurophysiology of cognitive dysfunction. I will use modern network theory as a theoretical and mathematical framework for this endeavor. My long-term goal is to advance our fundamental understanding of the neurophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in PD to provide empirically testable models, clinically relevant biomarkers, and novel therapeutic targets. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that patterns of cortical functional connectivity critical to normal cognitive function are disrupted by subcortical pathology in PD and that interventions which normalize these patterns will improve cognition. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data presented in this proposal and other previously published work. The research objectives of this proposal are to further our understanding of how cortical connectivity relates to cognitive dysfunction in PD, develop a novel biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in PD based on cortical physiology and to determine whether modulation of cortical connectivity may result in cognitive improvements in PD. We will accomplish the objectives of this proposal through three Specific Aims: 1) Determine whether graph theory measures of functional cortical activity measured with magnetoencephalography (MEG) are associated with cognitive dysfunction in PD subjects with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI); 2) Develop a novel state-defining biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in PD based on MEG features through a machine learning approach; and 3) Determine the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on MEG measures of cortical connectivity and cognitive outcomes in PD-MCI patients. The approach is innovative because it represents the first study to apply graph theory measures to understanding the relationship of cortical physiology and cognitive dysfunction in PD; the first study to apply machine learning approaches to cognitive PD biomarker development; and the first clinical trial or mechanistic study of rTMS in PD-MCI. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in PD and will provide biomarkers and pilot data essential to planning future therapeutic interventions. The training objectives and related research activities of this proposal will provide new skills, manuscripts and pilot data related to advanced MEG analysis, graph theory, biomarker development and rTMS trials necessary to establish my independence in these areas and obtain R01 funding to advance this unique research program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dementia is the leading cause of nursing home placement in Parkinson's disease (PD) yet little is known about the cause(s) of cognitive dysfunction in PD and there are no effective treatments. Our preliminary data and other published studies suggest that abnormalities in brain activity involving networks important for normal thinking and memory may contribute to cognitive dysfunction in PD and may represent a target for treatment. This proposal will identify abnormalities in cortical activity related to cognitive dysfunction in PD usng magneto encephalography and will perform a randomized control trial of frontal repetitive trans cranial magnetic stimulation to determine the therapeutic potential of modulating this brain activity.            ",Intrinsic Cortical Networks and Cognitive Dysfunction in Parkinson???s Disease,8635587,K02NS080885,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Cephalic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Elderly', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nursing Homes', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Rest', 'Symptoms', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'effective therapy', 'encephalography', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'physiologic model', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'skills', 'theories', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K02,2013,186354,292134808,0.02563552108979734
"Coupled level set framework for retinal segmentation and atlasing in SD-OCT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Some eye diseases exhibit abnormalities or atrophy of the retina, which can impair vision and cause blindness. Certain other diseases traditionally thought to be exclusively associated with the brain are now known to be associated with changes or differences in the retina, which can also impair vision. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), an imaging device that is enabling modern in-vivo high-resolution studies of the retina, is rapidly becoming a key imaging technology both in ophthalmology, where clinical diagnoses and disease monitoring are experiencing a dramatic technical revolution, and also in neurology, where noninvasive retinal markers of brain disease are beginning to emerge. A key limitation in the current technology is the lack of detailed, accurate, and fully-automated analysis of the retinal layers that are observed throughout the retina in a typical three-dimensional spectral domain (SD)-OCT exam. Although tools are beginning to appear in association with commercial devices, they are currently lacking in sophistication and are not validated or standardized across manufacturers. This deficiency is problematic for both clinical and scientific application of SD-OCT since the measurements are not of known precision and are therefore not easily compared both in the same subject longitudinally and in population cross sections. The proposed research takes advantage of state-of-the-art algorithms that are emerging in both computer vision and medical imaging and will apply, adapt, and extend them to the specific application of layer segmentation in three-dimensional retinal SD-OCT. Advanced tools for population averaging in a normalized space will also be developed specifically for retinal SD-OCT data. The methods will be validated against manual segmentation and normalization on both normal subjects and patients experiencing retinal degeneration largely associated with thinning of selective layers of the retina. Scans of patients with diseases causing significant retinopathy such as cysts, detachment, or scarring will be evaluated, but further development beyond the present research is expected to be needed to properly segment and quantify such cases. The developed software will be developed within the open-source Java Image Science Toolkit (JIST) framework and released as open source software.        The project will develop software for the image analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the retina. Segmentation and quantification of the characteristics of nerve layers within the retina is expected to be of great use on both ophthalmology and neurology, where the retina can be a sensitive indicator of both vision and neurological problems or diseases. Open source software written in a highly portable language will be made available to the research community at the conclusion of the research grant.

"Neural Mechanisms of Fixation Choice while Searching Natural Scenes  The overall goal of these experiments is to understand how the brain controls where we look. To accomplish this, it is important to study brain activity and behavior under conditions that closely approximate those in the real world. All of the experiments we propose to do will use awake behaving rhesus monkeys as subjects. In prior work, we have studied activity in the cortical frontal eye field while monkeys looked at images of natural scenes. The frontal eye field (FEF) is closely involved in the control of purposive voluntary eye movements. While the monkey searched for a target hidden in the images of natural scenes, the activity of FEF neurons consisted of combinations of activity related to planning upcoming eye movements, as well as activity that was sensitive to salient visual features of the image. In parallel with the development of our understanding of how the brain controls eye movements, there have been substantial advances in our understanding of the features of natural images that guide both human and monkey eye movements. These behavioral studies are at the advanced level of being able to accurately predict patterns of eye movements. Our goal in this proposal is to take advantage of these advancements in predicting patterns of eye movements in natural environments to help us understand the brain events that are responsible for this behavior. We will focus upon neuron activity in the FEF due to its essential role in the control of voluntary eye movements. The proposal has 3 Aims each focused upon a different factor that is known to guide eye movements under natural conditions. Salience describes how different a small part of a visual scene is from the remainder of the scene based upon stimulus features such as color, contrast, shape, and orientation. Our first aim will define the effects that salience has upon FEF activity. In our second aim, we'll quantify the effects of relevance. Relevance refers to the importance of visual features for the task at hand; for example, if we're looking for a red target, the red items in the image will be more likely to attract our attention and ultimately be the target for an eye movement. Knowing the broad composition of a scene, a quality that is called scene gist, can tell us the places where an object is more likely to be found. For example, if we are looking for a bicycle, we are more likely to search the sidewalks and roadways of a street scene and ignore other places where bicycles are unlikely to be found. Our final aim will look for the effects of scene gist upon monkey behavior and the FEF activity driving that behavior. In addition to the brain recording experiments outlined above, a large part of our effort will be devoted to mathematical analysis and modeling of the behavioral and neuronal data we obtain. Our ultimate goal is to provide a model that predicts the contributions of salience, relevance, and gist to the activity of FEF neurons. The successful model will be a mathematical representation that predicts search-related activity in the FEF for both artificial and real world conditions.  Due to the known and expected similarities between monkey and human eye movement systems, these experiments provide a model for the functional organization of frontal eye field cortex in humans. The ability to make appropriate eye movements is a function that can be damaged by a number of diseases, including cerebral stroke, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Schizophrenia. More specifically, deficits in the proper control of fixation during search of complex visual stimuli have been described in patients suffering from simultanagnosia, as well as in individuals with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.",Neural Mechanisms of Fixation Choice while Searching Natural Scenes,8451290,R01EY021579,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory area', 'Banana', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Bicycling', 'Brain', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Eye Movements', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Property', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Saccades', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'awake', 'base', 'driving behavior', 'expectation', 'frontal eye fields', 'interest', 'mind control', 'neuromechanism', 'research study', 'sample fixation', 'visual motor', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,364955,66720547,-0.003228644401788222
"Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurogenic (vasovagal) syncope (VVS) is a significant medical problem. The faint is preceded by a Vasovagal Response (VVR), characterized by a sudden drop in arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). VVS and VVRs are diagnosed using a tilt test, a vestibular stimulus. Despite being relatively common, the neural basis of the VVR and the role of the vestibular system in inducing VVRs are not known. Moreover, there is no small animal model of VVRs. We recently showed that low frequency sinusoidal galvanic vestibular stimulation (sGVS) induces VVRs in anesthetized rats. As in humans, VVRs are also induced in rats by tilt. In the proposed research we will characterize the physiological properties of VVRs in rats, thereby establishing a useful small animal model of human VVRs. We propose that VVRs are induced by strong, repeated stimulation of the vestibulo-sympathetic reflex (VSR), which maintains blood flow to the brain during changes in head position relative to gravity. Aim 1 will characterize the transitions from normal VSR to VVRs using pulses and sinusoids of galvanic stimulation to show that VVRs occur when the VSR is appropriately stimulated. Nose up tilt and Translation-While-Rotating (TWR) will be used to determine the axes of stimulation that are most likely to produce VVRs. Additionally, the low frequency oscillations in HR and BP that are produced by sGVS and tilt reflect activation of Mayer waves, thought to be of fundamental importance in maintaining BP stability. In Aim 2 these oscillations will be modeled using a novel concept in which Mayer wave function is represented by a non-linear relaxation oscillator. In Aim 3, single unit neurophysiological studies in otolith-recipient portions of the caudal vestibular nuclei will identify the functional characteristics and physiological signature of VVR- related neurons. Together, the proposed research will establish a model of VVS, document how the vestibular system controls BP, and demonstrate that VVRs are adaptive compensatory responses that serve to re- equilibrate BP after major perturbations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vasovagal syncope (VVS; unexpected fainting) and vasovagal responses (VVR) are a significant medical problem when they recur frequently; the underlying causes and neural mechanisms that produce such fainting are unknown. We have recently shown that activation of the vestibular system causes arterial blood pressure and heart rate changes in anesthetized rats that are similar to the changes in humans during these faints. In this project, we will characterize the changes in blood pressure and heart rate that are produced by activation of the vestibular system with tilts and galvanic stimulation, model the process that is causing the faints with a novel relaxation oscillator, and investigate the underlying neuronal basis for these responses.            ",Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response,8505855,R01DC012573,"['Acceleration', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Baroreflex', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Discontinuous Capillary', 'Drops', 'Feedback', 'Force of Gravity', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Head', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Reaction', 'Reflex action', 'Refractory', 'Relative (related person)', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Stimulus', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Vasovagal', 'Vasovagal Syncope', 'Vestibular nucleus structure', 'Width', 'base', 'blood pressure regulation', 'data modeling', 'falls', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'operation', 'otoconia', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'vector']",NIDCD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2013,365000,415711940,0.01258515973334002
"Noninvasive imaging-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to establish a strategy that will make neuronal electrical signaling detectable via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a whole-brain level. Our approach is built on the novel concept of using cell-adhesive micron-scale electronic devices to transduce neuronal potentials across the brain into magnetic field fluctuations. As part of our validation of these voltage-sensing microprobes, we also propose to implement a new, scalable method for simultaneous recording of MRI and electrophysiological data. The methods we propose to develop will be broadly applicable to problems in neurobiology, and will transform neuroscientists' ability to study integrative functions of the brain. Our microprobe approach will also help establish a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine and molecular imaging, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology. Recent work has dem- onstrated that micron-scale electrodes, coated with cell-adhesive molecules and juxtaposed against cultured cells allow recording of millivolt-scale action potentials, comparable to intracellular recordings. The current induced in a microelectrode can be converted into a modest, transient magnetic field if it is channeled into an inductor. In Specific Aim 1, we will model the magnetic fields produced by feasible currents in spiral or solenoidal microcoils of defined geometry, compute predicted effects on MRI signal amplitude and phase as a function of microprobe distribution, and fabricate the microprobes themselves. Preliminary calculations indicate that localized, transient fields of about 10 nT could be produced in individual 10-turn microcoils of 1 5m diameter. Magnetic fields of this order are greater than endogenous neuronal fields detected in tech- nologies like magnetoencephalography, and have been shown previously to be measurable by MRI in some contexts. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the ability of our microprobes to report action potentials from neu- ronal populations in MRI. The microdevices wil first be applied to cultured neurons or neural tissue slices and placed in an MRI scanner. Data series will be obtained using multiple protocols to detect variations of MRI signal due to variations in neuronal activity. If experiments in culture are successful, microprobes will be site-specifically injected into the cerebral cortex of anesthetized rats, and tested in an somatosensory stimu- lation paradigm. In Specific Aim 3, we will establish a simultaneous MRI and conventional electrophysiology approach to validate the novel MRI voltage probes directly. Performing electrophysiology in an MRI scanner is complicated by artifacts induced by the scanning hardware, in particular due to switched gradient fields. To circumvent this problem, we will measure neuronal potentials using differential recording from pairs of channels on tetrodes or modified tetrodes. Once the in-scanner recording method has been refined, MRI- based and conventional electrophysiology data will be obtained and compared to assess performance of the voltage-sensing microprobes, and to guide further improvements, if necessary.         Noninvasive MRI-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices will have high impact in biology, and specifically in brain research, both through applications to the study of neurological disease and as tools for the analysis of neural network function in basic neuroscience. The microprobes we propose to develop represent a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology.

"Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging provides a safe, non-invasive measurement of the whole brain, and has enabled large clinical and research studies for brain development, aging, and disorders. However, many disorders, i.e., major neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alteration, which are often difficult to identify visually and compare over time. To address this critical issu, in the renewal phase of this project, we will continue to work with GE Research to develop and disseminate a software package for brain measurement, comparison, and diagnosis. The new tools include 1) a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases-based segmentation method for precise measurement of brain alteration patterns, and 2) novel pattern classification and regression methods for early detection and longitudinal monitoring of brain disorders. Aims. Currently, most existing atlas-based labeling methods simply warp each atlas independently to the individual brain for multi-atlases-based structural labeling. This could lead to 1) inaccurate labeling due to possible large registration error when the atlases are very different from the target individual brain, and 2) inconsistent labeling of the same brain structure across different individuals due to independent labeling of each individual brain. The first goal of this project is hence to develop a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases -based segmentation method for simultaneous registration and joint labeling of all individual brains by concurrent consideration of all atlases. With measurements of brain structures and their alteration patterns, univariate analysis methods are often used to understand how the disease affects brain structure and function at a group level. Although this can lead to better understanding of neurological pathology of brain disorders, more sophisticated image analysis methods are urgently needed for quantitative assessment and early diagnosis of brain abnormality at an individual level. Thus, the second goal of this project is to develop various novel machine learning methods for early diagnosis of brain disorders and better quantification of brain abnormality at an individual level. Specifically, we will take Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia, as an example for demonstrating the performance of our proposed methods in early diagnosis of AD, as well as in prediction of long-term outcomes of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The last goal of this project is to build, for ou developed methods, the respective software modules for the 3D Slicer (a free open-source software package with a flexible modular platform for medical image analysis and visualization, http://www.slicer.org/), to promote the potential clinical applications by using tools in 3D Slicer for preprocessing of patient data and our tools for diagnosis. Again, this software development work will be performed in collaboration with our current collaborator, GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) that is focused on developing 3D Slicer. Both source code and pre-compiled programs will be made freely available. Applications. These methods can find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormality of neurological diseases (i.e., AD and schizophrenia), measuring effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between structural and cognitive function variables.          Description of Project This project aims to develop a novel method for accurate measurement of brain structure and function by groupwise registration and joint labeling of all individual images via multiple manual-labeled atlases. Moreover, several novel tools for brain abnormality measurement will also be developed for early detection and progression monitoring of brain disorders using both multimodal imaging and non-imaging data. By successful development of these brain measurement tools, the respective software modules will be developed and further incorporated into 3D Slicer via collaboration with GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC).

"Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate mapping of normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and premature neonates is a key factor in the early detection of developmental disorders as well as understanding how external factors can influence early brain growth. The combination of fast multi-slice MRI techniques with computer vision algorithms has recently provided the ability to reliably image 3D brain structure in-utero providing valuable information inaccessible to ultrasound imaging. To complement this new structural information, recently there has been increasing interest in the use of functional MR imaging (fMRI) to map the development of resting state brain function in children, premature neonates and, most recently, fetuses in-utero. This work has revealed signs of a predictable developmental path in the formation of resting state patterns of brain activity present in adults and abnormalities in these patterns in children have been linked with neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions in later life. Such fMRI methods, previously used in adults and children, could provide a unique new window into functional activity in the developing fetal brain. However, the imaging techniques required suffer from an important limitation for use in the fetus: they make use of repeated acquisitions where subtle changes in MR signal provide the measure of interest. Fetal head motion within the scanner perturbs both measurement location and signal level due to the changing relationship between fetal anatomy, maternal anatomy and the scanner. Based on our preliminary results, in this proposal we plan to develop a set of new signal and geometry correction methods specifically for fetal fMRI that combine novel acquisition techniques with post-processing algorithms to provide a new route to addressing these unique problems. This will allow us to collect the first accurate functional MRI data from a range of un-sedated fetuses in ages and activity levels seen in clinical studies. We will develop and validate these methods together with complementary pattern analysis techniques specifically aimed at motion scattered data and employ them to build the first combined 4D structure-function map of brain development in-utero. This will show for the first time the temporal and spatial relationship between structural changes and the development of resting state patterns of brain activity covering the critical age of first clinical MRI scan and the following period of cortical folding. his will help answer such questions as: which tissue zones of the fetal brain such activity begins, and whether the functional patterns are related to the timing of the formation of specific cortical folds. We will collect a range of data that captures fetuses both at different ages and different states of activity representing those seen in typical clinical studies, and in addition collect valuable outcome measures on the babies after birth against which in-utero measure will be evaluated. We release the data to the community as a whole in the form of an open-access 4D atlas. This combined structure-function data will provide a unique new reference for both neuroscience and, in the longer term, clinical evaluation of brain health during pregnancy and premature birth.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinically, improved in-utero evaluation of the fetal brain is a key concern for obstetricians and pediatricians in managing complex pregnancies and there is also now an increasing public health awareness of the influence of the in-utero environment, in terms of factors such as stress and diet, on long-term health in adult life. Functional connectivit imaging of the brain in childhood has revealed the presence of early markers of later cognitive and neuropsychological problems. The ability to map these same properties in utero, promises to provide a rich set of very specific early markers that can be used to understand the impact of the in-utero environment on brain function and feasibly provide a route to the use of early neuro-protective agents and procedures early in childhood.                ",Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero,8509448,R01EB017133,"['Accounting', 'Acoustic Stimulation', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Movement', 'Fetus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Prematurity of fetus', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protective Agents', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'interest', 'neonate', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'population based', 'premature', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'spatial relationship', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2013,650062,533302350,0.012989776697985685
"Manipulating Neural Tissue with Ultra-Short Laser Pulses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We seek to renew our joint discovery and technology based bioengineering research partnership (BRP).  Our program advances the use of amplified ultrashort laser pulses as a tool to manipulate living and histological tissue.  This unique technology, pioneered by the BRP team, permits tissue to be cut on the micrometer scale by light-fueled plasma-meditated ablation.  Cutting occurs without thermal damage and can be combined with spectroscopic feedback to identify and limit the region being perturbed.  We advance this technology in new ways, including the use of temporal focusing for deep ablation, and apply it to three key test beds.  The first is construction of the angiotome, i.e., a complete vectorized map of cortical vasculature; here we use plasma mediated ablation to automate a form of block-face imaging along with novel algorithms to filter and vectorize features in the data.  The second is the study of neuronal viability in response to perturbations of subcortical blood flow; here we use plasma-mediated ablation to block flow in individual targeted microvessels that lie below the cortical surface.  The third test bed is the automation of cranial and spinal surgery; we combine plasma-mediated ablation with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy to cut bone yet avoid injury to soft tissue.  These investigations are particularly relevant to diagnosing and understanding microinfarctions, i.e., damage to the brain as the result of damage to single cortical vessels, that accumulate with age and trauma.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  These studies advance the use of light to image and manipulate the flow of blood in the brain.  We make use of rats and mice as model systems for our experiments.  The new capabilities from the proposed work hold two promises for advances in medicine:  One is an understanding of micro- infarctions - lesions of individual blood vessels in cortex that lead to the death of brain cells- that accrue with age and trauma.  The second is an understanding of the normal patterns of blood flow throughout the brain, which provide the basis for interpreting medical images of brain function.

"Pattern Analysis of Large-Scale Functional Connectivity in SAD The current proposal is aimed at developing a novel neurobiological marker based on patterns of whole-brain functional connectivity during implicit and subliminal threat-related facial emotion perception to aid the diagnosis and assessment of treatment response in social anxiety (SAD) and panic disorder (PD). The following Specific Aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1). Develop, apply and validate an approach to estimate the large-scale functional networks of implicit and subliminal threat-related and ambiguous facial emotion processing in a healthy control subject pool. We will perform this by first testing whether large-scale partial correlations measured during a particular condition (i.e. presentation of visible or invisible fearful and neutral faces) can be used as features to predict the stimulus type presented during the condition (Sub-aim 1a). We will then test whether the most informative features for predicting fearful vs. neutral face conditions are connections among primarily limbic and paralimbic nodes, and that the most informative features in predicting neutral vs. resting states conditions are connections among primarily attention, motor and sensory related regions (Sub-aim 1b). Specific Aim 2). Determine whether the approach developed in SA1 may have potential clinical application towards the diagnosis and treatment of SAD and PD. We will perform this by testing whether the above functional networks are informative brain signatures that can be used to discriminate between healthy controls, SAD and PD subjects (Sub-aim 2a). We will also test whether the approach can be used to determine the particular sub-networks that are aberrant in SAD and PD (Sub-aim 2b). PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed approach may contribute toward the development of effective biomarkers in the diagnosis of SAD and PD. It may also identify the functional connections whose patterns differ between control and SAD, control and PD, and SAD and PD. This would contribute to our understanding of and aid in the development of therapies for these distinct anxiety disorders.",Pattern Analysis of Large-Scale Functional Connectivity in SAD,8262402,F31MH088104,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Atlases', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Panic Disorder', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Perception', 'Population Control', 'Process', 'Rest', 'Sensory', 'Social Controls', 'Stimulus', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinical application', 'disorder control', 'improved', 'novel', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'therapy development', 'treatment response']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2012,38180,558628098,0.013350665897206293
"The Role of LFP Spatial Structure in the Hippocampus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this work is to understand how the activity of neurons is coordinated within the hippocampus, a brain region involved in the storage of memories. One manifestation of this coordination is the local field potential (LFP), the summed electrical activity of a small volume of neural tissue. Recently, multi- electrode arrays (MEAs) have enabled the simultaneous measurement of LFPs and single-neuron activity from multiple sites within the brain of an animal as it performs a task. This advance motivates the development of new computational methods that can identify the relationships that exist within these rich, large data sets. The temporal structure of hippocampal LFPs is known to correlate with single-neuron activity, as well as with behavioral state. In contrast, the spatial structure of these LFPs remains relatively unexplored. An interesting example of this spatial structure are the traveling LFP waves that propagate through the hippocampus. This project will examine whether the spatial dynamics of the hippocampal LFP influence neuronal activity and its relationship to behavior. Its aims are 1) to identify a parsimonious model for explaining the observed spatio- temporal structure in the LFP; 2) to investigate the relationship of LFP structure to single-neuron activity; and 3) to understand how LFP structure governs circuit-level neuronal processing within the hippocampus. To achieve these goals, this project will employ statistical learning techniques to extract spatio-temporal regularities from within the LFP, and use predictive models to examine the influence of different LFP structures on the population activity of hippocampal neurons. This work will identify concise metrics that capture the richness of high-dimensional hippocampal LFP measurements. Furthermore, it will examine the utility of incorporating complex dynamical features into current models of hippocampal processing. This work may help understand how distortions in electrical activity within the hippocampus lead to conditions such as epilepsy and amnesia. It will evaluate the suitability of the LFP as a direct target for neuroprosthetic interventions. Finally, it may lead to screening procedures for rapidly finding potential abnormalities in patients' brain activity, and help understand the implications of such abnormalities for patients' lifestyles.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a more complete description of the electrical waves of activity found in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that stores memories. These waves exhibit spatial patterns that may help guide the proper function of the hippocampus. This work could potentially explain how distortions in electrical activity relate to defects in people's abilities to form and recall memories.

"Functional neuroimaging of language processing in primary progressive aphasia  Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a clinical syndrome in which degeneration of language regions in the dominant hemisphere is associated with progressive deficits in speech and/or language function. The overall goals of this project are to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural changes underlying linguistic deficits in PPA, and to use this information to better discriminate patients with variants of PPA from each other and from normal aging. Recent studies have identified three clinical variants of PPA: progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA), semantic dementia (SD) and logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA). Each variant is associated with characteristic linguistic features, distinct patterns of brain atrophy, and different likelihoods of particular underlying pathogenic processes, making correct differential diagnosis highly relevant. We will recruit 48 patients with PPA (16 of each variant) and 24 normal controls over a three year period, and acquire fMRI data along with structural MRI, linguistic and cognitive measures. The fMRI paradigm consists of a syntactic processing task with seven conditions parametrically varying in syntactic complexity. The research will address two specific aims. The first is to identify the relationships between volume loss, changes in functional MRI activation, and linguistic deficits, in the different PPA variants. The second aim is to improve differential diagnosis of PPA variants using machine learning algorithms incorporating both structural and functional imaging measures.  PPA is a devastating disorder that prevents individuals from communicating and functioning in society. The knowledge gained in this study will increase our understanding of the neural basis of language processing and its breakdown in PPA, and will contribute to earlier, more accurate differential diagnosis of PPA variants, enabling emerging therapies to be targeted to likely underlying etiologies.",Functional neuroimaging of language processing in primary progressive aphasia,8247172,R03DC010878,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Agrammatism', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anterior', 'Aphasia', 'Atrophic', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Comprehension', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Functional Aphasias', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Left', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Progressive Aphasias', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Role', 'Semantic Dementias', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Taxes', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cohort', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'normal aging', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'syntax']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R03,2012,121968,161094826,-0.02708051677378645
"Integrating Multimodal Brain Imaging Data to Assess Subtle Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional neuroimaging studies of the human brain have become increasingly important in the understanding of normal and pathological processes of cognition. Sophisticated statistical analytic frameworks have been developed to locate signal change and define brain networks involved in various tasks. However, in subtle cognitive impairment-e.g., exposure-related illness, early stages of degenerative diseases, injury, secondary illness following adjuvant therapy for cancer-these methods tend to have low sensitivity for detecting small changes in brain states resulting from mild brain dysfunction. An understanding of disease mechanism or progression of subtle cognitive dysfunction requires a novel statistical analytic framework with improved sensitivity to measure small changes in brain states. We have developed an innovative methodology that we successfully applied in measures of regional cerebral blood flow experiments. These methods use well established spatial modeling procedures, new to the functional brain imaging field, to derive statistically optimal spatial summaries within effective resolution groups or ""kriging"", shown by preliminary studies to improve signal detection sensitivity and mitigate the multiple testing burden. Within this new spatial modeling framework, we propose to extend the kriging methodology to fMRI and EEG, modify existing techniques for characterizing brain networks of connectivity (e.g., kriging-based independent components analysis), and integrate the imaging modalities using a statistical classifier based on derived inputs of data driven effective resolution groups. Our primary goal is to develop this analysis framework to provide insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms of mild cognitive dysfunction. Achieving this goal may suggest treatments to alleviate symptoms, prevent progression, or at minimum, provide an informed clinical management of cognitively impaired patients.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cognitive impairment is a major health concern, affecting people of all ages. Causes range from traumatic injury to toxin exposures, including chemotherapy for cancer treatment, to degenerative diseases. Mechanisms of damage or disease remain difficult to establish using current methods in functional brain imaging studies due to an inability to measure very small changes in brain states. We propose a new analytic framework using existing technology to improve the ability to measure subtle changes important in the understanding of disease pathology of impaired cognition and to greatly facilitate the integration of information from several imaging modalities with potential implications for clinical management and treatment.              Cognitive impairment is a major health concern, affecting people of all ages.

"Fusion of Electromagnetic Brain Imaging and fMRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multimodal non-invasive functional brain imaging has made a tremendous impact in improving our understanding of the neural correlates of human behavior, and is now an indispensable tool for systems and cognitive neuroscientists. We propose to develop state-of-the-art multimodal functional imaging fusion algorithms for accurate visualization of the brain's dynamic activity and high spatial and temporal resolution. We propose to develop algorithms that combine complementary high spatial resolution of functional MRI (fMRI) and high-temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) data for high-fidelity reconstruction of brain activity. In recent years, our research group has developed a suite of novel and powerful algorithms for MEG/EEG imaging superior to existing benchmark algorithms, and we have compared these results with electrocorticography (ECOG). Specifically, our algorithms can solve for many brain sources, including sources located far from the sensors, in the presence of large interference from unrelated brain sources using fast and robust probabilistic inference techniques. Here, we propose to extend this success in M/EEG inverse algorithms into the domain of multimodal imaging data fusion. Our overall goal here is to ultimately produce robust, high fidelity videos of event-related brain activation at a sub-millimeter and sub-millisecond resolution from noisy MEG/EEG and fMRI data using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we propose to extend a powerful new algorithm that we have recently developed, called Champagne, into two new fusion algorithms that combine fMRI, MEG and EEG data in different ways. Performance of both algorithms will first be rigorously evaluated in simulations, including performance comparisons with existing benchmark fusion algorithms. Algorithms will then tested for consistency on four fMRI-MEG+EEG datasets from healthy controls obtained for identical paradigms (auditory, motor, picture naming and verb-generation) and two fMRI-EEG datasets (face and motion perception). Additional validation studies will also be performed on fMRI-MEG/EEG datasets obtained from epilepsy patients and compared to electrocorticography (ECoG). Following successful testing and evaluation, all algorithms developed in this grant proposal, as well as example validation datasets, will be distributed using NUTMEG (nutmeg.berkeley.edu), an open-source software toolbox that we have developed.        Multimodal non-invasive functional brain imaging has made a tremendous impact in improving our understanding of the neural correlates of human behavior, and is now an indispensable tool for systems and cognitive neuroscientists. With the development of appropriate analytical tools, multimodal functional brain imaging is in the process of revolutionizing the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, dementia, and epilepsy that affect tens of millions of Americans.

"Coupled level set framework for retinal segmentation and atlasing in SD-OCT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Some eye diseases exhibit abnormalities or atrophy of the retina, which can impair vision and cause blindness. Certain other diseases traditionally thought to be exclusively associated with the brain are now known to be associated with changes or differences in the retina, which can also impair vision. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), an imaging device that is enabling modern in-vivo high-resolution studies of the retina, is rapidly becoming a key imaging technology both in ophthalmology, where clinical diagnoses and disease monitoring are experiencing a dramatic technical revolution, and also in neurology, where noninvasive retinal markers of brain disease are beginning to emerge. A key limitation in the current technology is the lack of detailed, accurate, and fully-automated analysis of the retinal layers that are observed throughout the retina in a typical three-dimensional spectral domain (SD)-OCT exam. Although tools are beginning to appear in association with commercial devices, they are currently lacking in sophistication and are not validated or standardized across manufacturers. This deficiency is problematic for both clinical and scientific application of SD-OCT since the measurements are not of known precision and are therefore not easily compared both in the same subject longitudinally and in population cross sections. The proposed research takes advantage of state-of-the-art algorithms that are emerging in both computer vision and medical imaging and will apply, adapt, and extend them to the specific application of layer segmentation in three-dimensional retinal SD-OCT. Advanced tools for population averaging in a normalized space will also be developed specifically for retinal SD-OCT data. The methods will be validated against manual segmentation and normalization on both normal subjects and patients experiencing retinal degeneration largely associated with thinning of selective layers of the retina. Scans of patients with diseases causing significant retinopathy such as cysts, detachment, or scarring will be evaluated, but further development beyond the present research is expected to be needed to properly segment and quantify such cases. The developed software will be developed within the open-source Java Image Science Toolkit (JIST) framework and released as open source software.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will develop software for the image analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the retina. Segmentation and quantification of the characteristics of nerve layers within the retina is expected to be of great use on both ophthalmology and neurology, where the retina can be a sensitive indicator of both vision and neurological problems or diseases.

"Analytic Methods for Determining Multimodal Biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There has been considerable progress in understanding the biology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Reliable biomarkers are still lacking, however, for early stage detection of PD and for characterizing disease progression. Advances in biotechnology have led to the advent of mental health studies that collect large-scale, multi-dimensional data sets, including brain imaging data, genomic data, and biologic and clinical measures. Such studies provide an unprecedented opportunity for cross-cutting investigations that stand to gain a deeper understanding of PD. A major limiting factor to multidimensional biomarker development, however, is the lack of statistical tools available to accommodate diverse, large-scale data. Leveraging data from neuromelanin magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI) of the locus coeruleus and the substantia nigra, chemical shift imaging (CSI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting-state functional MRI, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analytes, genotype information, and numerous clinical variables, we plan to develop novel statistical techniques to identify multimodal PD biomarkers. Our data provide an unprecedented opportunity for cross-cutting methodological advances in multimodal PD biomarker discovery. Separately, we will consider a massive patient database with nearly 250,000 subscribers in Georgia. Building on our collective expertise in developing statistical and machine-learning methods for large-scale imaging data and in the pathophysiology of PD, we plan to advance methods for PD biomarker analyses and discovery through the following specific aims. First, we plan to develop new statistical techniques to reveal multimodal biomarkers for PD including imaging, clinical, and biologic variables. Secondly, we plan to utilize the massive clinical database to identify clinical risk factors for early stage PD.

"Noninvasive imaging-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to establish a strategy that will make neuronal electrical signaling detectable via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a whole-brain level. Our approach is built on the novel concept of using cell-adhesive micron-scale electronic devices to transduce neuronal potentials across the brain into magnetic field fluctuations. As part of our validation of these voltage-sensing microprobes, we also propose to implement a new, scalable method for simultaneous recording of MRI and electrophysiological data. The methods we propose to develop will be broadly applicable to problems in neurobiology, and will transform neuroscientists' ability to study integrative functions of the brain. Our microprobe approach will also help establish a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine and molecular imaging, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology. Recent work has dem- onstrated that micron-scale electrodes, coated with cell-adhesive molecules and juxtaposed against cultured cells allow recording of millivolt-scale action potentials, comparable to intracellular recordings. The current induced in a microelectrode can be converted into a modest, transient magnetic field if it is channeled into an inductor. In Specific Aim 1, we will model the magnetic fields produced by feasible currents in spiral or solenoidal microcoils of defined geometry, compute predicted effects on MRI signal amplitude and phase as a function of microprobe distribution, and fabricate the microprobes themselves. Preliminary calculations indicate that localized, transient fields of about 10 nT could be produced in individual 10-turn microcoils of 1 5m diameter. Magnetic fields of this order are greater than endogenous neuronal fields detected in tech- nologies like magnetoencephalography, and have been shown previously to be measurable by MRI in some contexts. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the ability of our microprobes to report action potentials from neu- ronal populations in MRI. The microdevices wil first be applied to cultured neurons or neural tissue slices and placed in an MRI scanner. Data series will be obtained using multiple protocols to detect variations of MRI signal due to variations in neuronal activity. If experiments in culture are successful, microprobes will be site-specifically injected into the cerebral cortex of anesthetized rats, and tested in an somatosensory stimu- lation paradigm. In Specific Aim 3, we will establish a simultaneous MRI and conventional electrophysiology approach to validate the novel MRI voltage probes directly. Performing electrophysiology in an MRI scanner is complicated by artifacts induced by the scanning hardware, in particular due to switched gradient fields. To circumvent this problem, we will measure neuronal potentials using differential recording from pairs of channels on tetrodes or modified tetrodes. Once the in-scanner recording method has been refined, MRI- based and conventional electrophysiology data will be obtained and compared to assess performance of the voltage-sensing microprobes, and to guide further improvements, if necessary.         Noninvasive MRI-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices will have high impact in biology, and specifically in brain research, both through applications to the study of neurological disease and as tools for the analysis of neural network function in basic neuroscience. The microprobes we propose to develop represent a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology.

"Neural Mechanisms of Fixation Choice while Searching Natural Scenes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of these experiments is to understand how the brain controls where we look. To accomplish this, it is important to study brain activity and behavior under conditions that closely approximate those in the real world. All of the experiments we propose to do will use awake behaving rhesus monkeys as subjects. In prior work, we have studied activity in the cortical frontal eye field while monkeys looked at images of natural scenes. The frontal eye field (FEF) is closely involved in the control of purposive voluntary eye movements. While the monkey searched for a target hidden in the images of natural scenes, the activity of FEF neurons consisted of combinations of activity related to planning upcoming eye movements, as well as activity that was sensitive to salient visual features of the image. In parallel with the development of our understanding of how the brain controls eye movements, there have been substantial advances in our understanding of the features of natural images that guide both human and monkey eye movements. These behavioral studies are at the advanced level of being able to accurately predict patterns of eye movements. Our goal in this proposal is to take advantage of these advancements in predicting patterns of eye movements in natural environments to help us understand the brain events that are responsible for this behavior. We will focus upon neuron activity in the FEF due to its essential role in the control of voluntary eye movements. The proposal has 3 Aims each focused upon a different factor that is known to guide eye movements under natural conditions. Salience describes how different a small part of a visual scene is from the remainder of the scene based upon stimulus features such as color, contrast, shape, and orientation. Our first aim will define the effects that salience has upon FEF activity. In our second aim, we'll quantify the effects of relevance. Relevance refers to the importance of visual features for the task at hand; for example, if we're looking for a red target, the red items in the image will be more likely to attrat our attention and ultimately be the target for an eye movement. Knowing the broad composition of a scene, a quality that is called scene gist, can tell us the places where an object is more likely to be found. For example, if we are looking for a bicycle, we are more likely to search the sidewalks and roadways of a street scene and ignore other places where bicycles are unlikely to be found. Our final aim will look for the effects of scene gist upon monkey behavior and the FEF activity driving that behavior. In addition to the brain recording experiments outlined above, a large part of our effort will be devoted to mathematical analysis and modeling of the behavioral and neuronal data we obtain. Our ultimate goal is to provide a model that predicts the contributions of salience, relevance, and gist to the activity of FEF neurons. The successful model will be a mathematical representation that predicts search-related activity in the FEF for both artificial and real world conditions.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Due to the known and expected similarities between monkey and human eye movement systems, these experiments provide a model for the functional organization of frontal eye field cortex in humans. The ability to make appropriate eye movements is a function that can be damaged by a number of diseases, including cerebral stroke, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Schizophrenia. More specifically, deficits in the proper control of fixation during search of complex visual stimuli have been described in patients suffering from simultanagnosia, as well as in individuals with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.                  Due to the known and expected similarities between monkey and human eye movement systems, these experiments provide a model for the functional organization of frontal eye field cortex in humans.

"Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging provides a safe, non-invasive measurement of the whole brain, and has enabled large clinical and research studies for brain development, aging, and disorders. However, many disorders, i.e., major neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alteration, which are often difficult to identify visually and compare over time. To address this critical issu, in the renewal phase of this project, we will continue to work with GE Research to develop and disseminate a software package for brain measurement, comparison, and diagnosis. The new tools include 1) a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases-based segmentation method for precise measurement of brain alteration patterns, and 2) novel pattern classification and regression methods for early detection and longitudinal monitoring of brain disorders. Aims. Currently, most existing atlas-based labeling methods simply warp each atlas independently to the individual brain for multi-atlases-based structural labeling. This could lead to 1) inaccurate labeling due to possible large registration error when the atlases are very different from the target individual brain, and 2) inconsistent labeling of the same brain structure across different individuals due to independent labeling of each individual brain. The first goal of this project is hence to develop a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases -based segmentation method for simultaneous registration and joint labeling of all individual brains by concurrent consideration of all atlases. With measurements of brain structures and their alteration patterns, univariate analysis methods are often used to understand how the disease affects brain structure and function at a group level. Although this can lead to better understanding of neurological pathology of brain disorders, more sophisticated image analysis methods are urgently needed for quantitative assessment and early diagnosis of brain abnormality at an individual level. Thus, the second goal of this project is to develop various novel machine learning methods for early diagnosis of brain disorders and better quantification of brain abnormality at an individual level. Specifically, we will take Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia, as an example for demonstrating the performance of our proposed methods in early diagnosis of AD, as well as in prediction of long-term outcomes of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The last goal of this project is to build, for ou developed methods, the respective software modules for the 3D Slicer (a free open-source software package with a flexible modular platform for medical image analysis and visualization, http://www.slicer.org/), to promote the potential clinical applications by using tools in 3D Slicer for preprocessing of patient data and our tools for diagnosis. Again, this software development work will be performed in collaboration with our current collaborator, GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) that is focused on developing 3D Slicer. Both source code and pre-compiled programs will be made freely available. Applications. These methods can find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormality of neurological diseases (i.e., AD and schizophrenia), measuring effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between structural and cognitive function variables.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Description of Project This project aims to develop a novel method for accurate measurement of brain structure and function by groupwise registration and joint labeling of all individual images via multiple manual-labeled atlases. Moreover, several novel tools for brain abnormality measurement will also be developed for early detection and progression monitoring of brain disorders using both multimodal imaging and non-imaging data. By successful development of these brain measurement tools, the respective software modules will be developed and further incorporated into 3D Slicer via collaboration with GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC).

"Early Diagnosis of Human Prion Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human prion diseases, such as Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease (CJD), are difficult to diagnose and are of increasing public health concern due to the risk of transmission. Our dementia program is a major referral center for prion diseases in the United States with 952 potential CJD referrals over the past six years. We also are conducting the first ever US sporadic CJD (sCJD) treatment trial, sponsored by the NIH. Unfortunately, many cases of sCJD are misdiagnosed or are diagnosed too late in the course for any future potential treatment to be effective. We, and others, have shown that brain MRI has very high sensitivity and specificity for sCJD diagnosis. Unfortunately, the most widely used diagnostic criteria for sCJD, Revised 1998 WHO Criteria, are problematic for several reasons: 1. they require symptoms that often do not occur until late in the disease course; 2. they do not use MRI; 3. they use a surrogate biomarker in the spinal fluid, the 14-3-3 protein, which we have found lacks sensitivity and specificity; and 4. they rely on certain electroencephalography (EEG) findings that have low sensitivity, particularly earlier in the disease. We will prospectively evaluate 100 patients with sCJD, 20 patients with symptomatic gCJD, and 40 patients with asymptomatic (presymptomatic gCJD) and 80 with other forms of rapidly progressive dementia (RPDs) over five years. We will conduct comprehensive assessments, including clinical, behavioral, spinal fluid surrogate marker, EEG, and MRI analyses. We will evaluate our gCJD at an age close to their predicted age of onset which will help us to identify the earliest signs of prion disease. A major focus will be to identify specific regions and patterns of abnormality on FLAIR and DTI MRI that can differentiate sCJD from other RPDs. Through this prospectively acquired data, we will devise a state of the art diagnostic scheme, using contemporary statistical classification techniques and logistic regression, for early diagnosis of sCJD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prion diseases are uniformly fatal, transmissible neurodegenerative diseases. At least one form can be transmitted by blood transfusion, and prions have now been found in several other tissues outside of the nervous system, including muscle, lymphoreticular tissues, and olfactory epithelia. Through earlier diagnosis, patients may be spared unnecessary and time-consuming diagnostic procedures and have better chance of responding to potential treatments, and the risk of transmission can be greatly reduced.          n/a",Early Diagnosis of Human Prion Disease,8305521,R01AG031189,"['Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologist', 'Olfactory Epithelium', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prion Diseases', 'Prions', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serological', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'base', 'cohort', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'forest', 'improved', 'meetings', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'programs', 'tertiary care', 'transmission process', 'treatment program', 'treatment trial']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2012,569059,685608202,0.004802182572785664
"Toward Individually-tailored Medicine: Probabilistic Models of Cerebral Aneurysms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding, both from incidental discovery on imaging studies and on autopsy; it is estimated that anywhere from 1-6% of the American population will develop this problem. Unfortunately, while our ability to detect ICAs has grown, our fundamental understanding of this disease entity remains lacking and significant debate continues in regards to its treatment. Given the high degree of mortality and comorbidity associated with ruptured intracranial aneurysms, it is imperative that new insights and approaches be developed to inform medical decision making involving ICAs. Thus, the objective of this proposal is the creation of an informatics infrastructure to help elucidate the genesis, progression, and treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Building from our efforts from the previous R01, a set of technical developments is outlined to transform the array of information routinely collected from clinical as- sessment of ICA patients into a Bayesian belief network (BBN) that models the disease. First, we evolve the concept of a phenomenon-centric data model (PCDM) as the basis for (temporally) organizing clinically-derived observations, enabling the model to be associated with processing pipelines that can identify and transform targeted variables from the content of clinical data sources. Through these pipelines, specific values in free- text reports (radiology, surgery, pathology, discharge summaries) and imaging studies will be automatically extracted into a scientific-quality database. Second, the PCDM schema for ICAs is mapped to a Bayesian belief network: the linkage between the PCDM and BBN allows automatic updating of the network and its progressive refinement from a growing dataset. The BBN's topology will be determined by clinical experts and conditional probabilities computed from the extracted clinical data. A basic graphical user interface (GUI) will permit users to interact with the BBN, aiding in medical decision making tasks. The GUI will allow a clinician to pose questions from either a set of common clinical queries or to create new queries: loading a patient's medical record into this application will automatically populate BBN variables with extracted information (i.e., from the pipelines). Each technical component of this proposal will be evaluated in a laboratory setting. In addition, the BBN will be tested for its predictive capabilities and compared to other statistical models to assess its potential in guiding ICA treatment. This proposal leverages a clinical collaboration with the UCLA Division of Interventional Neuroradiology, a leader in ICA research and treatment. A combined dataset of 2,000 retrospective and prospective subjects will be used to create the ICA database and BBN. Data collection will encompass a comprehensive set of variables including clinical presentation, imaging assessment (morphology, hemodynamics), histopathology, gene expression, treatment, and outcomes. We will additionally leverage the NIH/NINDS Human Genetic DNA and Cell Line Repository for additional ICA-related data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding on routine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) neuro-imaging studies. The associated mortality rate and comorbidity resultant from ruptured ICAs are extreme: subarachnoid hemorrhage causes 50% of individuals to die within one month of rupture, and more than one third of survivors develop major neurological deficits. Hence, the focus of this re- search is the creation of a comprehensive research database for ICA patients, using the spectrum of data routinely acquired in the diagnosis and treatment of the problem; from this database, a new probabilistic model of ICAs will be created, providing new insights into the disease and its optimal treatment for a given individual.

"Manipulating Neural Tissue with Ultra-Short Laser Pulses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We seek to renew our joint discovery and technology based bioengineering research partnership (BRP).  Our program advances the use of amplified ultrashort laser pulses as a tool to manipulate living and histological tissue.  This unique technology, pioneered by the BRP team, permits tissue to be cut on the micrometer scale by light-fueled plasma-meditated ablation.  Cutting occurs without thermal damage and can be combined with spectroscopic feedback to identify and limit the region being perturbed.  We advance this technology in new ways, including the use of temporal focusing for deep ablation, and apply it to three key test beds.  The first is construction of the angiotome, i.e., a complete vectorized map of cortical vasculature; here we use plasma mediated ablation to automate a form of block-face imaging along with novel algorithms to filter and vectorize features in the data.  The second is the study of neuronal viability in response to perturbations of subcortical blood flow; here we use plasma-mediated ablation to block flow in individual targeted microvessels that lie below the cortical surface.  The third test bed is the automation of cranial and spinal surgery; we combine plasma-mediated ablation with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy to cut bone yet avoid injury to soft tissue.  These investigations are particularly relevant to diagnosing and understanding microinfarctions, i.e., damage to the brain as the result of damage to single cortical vessels, that accumulate with age and trauma.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  These studies advance the use of light to image and manipulate the flow of blood in the brain.  We make use of rats and mice as model systems for our experiments.  The new capabilities from the proposed work hold two promises for advances in medicine:  One is an understanding of micro- infarctions - lesions of individual blood vessels in cortex that lead to the death of brain cells- that accrue with age and trauma.  The second is an understanding of the normal patterns of blood flow throughout the brain, which provide the basis for interpreting medical images of brain function.

"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase. Dementia has many possible underlying causes and several different causes are at work in most elderly demented subjects. In this grant, we will use modern brain imaging to identify specific mechanisms underlying progression to dementia.",Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging,8292033,R01AG011378,"['6-hydroxybenzothiazole', 'Abbreviations', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease Pathway', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Amyloidosis', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Applications Grants', 'Attenuated', 'Autopsy', 'Base of the Brain', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Correlation Studies', 'Critiques', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inositol', 'Label', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'N-acetylaspartate', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pittsburgh Compound-B', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scheme', 'Senile Plaques', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Spin Labels', 'Staging', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Syndrome', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'amyloid imaging', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'molecular imaging', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'population based', 'primary outcome', 'tool']",NIA,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2012,934653,276703803,-0.017946869576625498
"Bayesian Methods for Localizing Dynamic Brain Activity and Epileptogenic Zones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and related electroencephalography (EEG) use an array of sensors to non-invasively measure electromagnetic (EM) fields produced by synchronous current activity within the brain. While the temporal resolution is excellent relative to other functional imaging modalities, accurately localizing in 3D space the sources of brain activity involves solving a difficult, underdetermined inverse problem. Existing localization methods used clinically and for research purposes maintain significant shortcomings, including the inability to resolve complex source configurations, bias caused by source correlations, and sensitivity to sources of noise and interference. The latter can arise from eye blinks, heart beats, sensor imperfections, and industrial noise as well as from spontaneous background brain activity not associated with the brain sources of interest. Additionally, prototype algorithms ostensibly designed to deal with some of these issues are heuristic in nature and have not been rigorously evaluated or compared, making their ultimate utility difficult to assess for neuroelectromagnetic imaging practitioners. The proposed research plan addresses all of these concerns by developing a principled localization scheme that unifies and extends existing localization strategies using modern concepts from Bayesian statistics and machine learning. Based on the notion of automatic relevance determination (ARD), brain regions with probable (relevant) activity are located with high spatial resolution. Interference sources are effectively removed by integrating with a variation factor analysis model. To quantify the improvement afforded by the proposed methodology, source location estimates will be compared with standard algorithms using realistic simulations, near-ground-truth data obtained from invasive electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings, and surgical data. The result will be implemented as a user-friendly localization toolbox and made freely available to the community by integrating with existing open-source functional brain imaging software. Non-invasive mapping of brain activity with high spatio-temporal resolution has important consequences for basic neuroscience studies of human cognition. It also has profound implications for the diagnosis, characterization and treatment of various neurological, neurooncological, mental health, developmental, and communication disorders. For example, localizations of brain sources are used to map cognitive function in epileptogenic areas and in neighboring brain regions. Such brain mapping procedures are then useful to guide neurosurgical planning, navigation, and resection and to minimize post-operative deficits.           n/a",Bayesian Methods for Localizing Dynamic Brain Activity and Epileptogenic Zones,7942859,F32NS061395,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Bayesian Method', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blinking', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive Science', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Communication Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetic Fields', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Imaging', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resected', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'genetic pedigree', 'heuristics', 'human CYP2B6 protein', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'neurophysiology', 'open source', 'operation', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2011,19755,685608202,0.023443078033729126
"Assessment of Gene Effects on the Brain and Disease Risk through Machine Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several neuroimaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are becoming increasingly important for diagnostic classification, prognostic evaluation and tracking treatment response in patients with brain disorders. They provide detailed, quantitative information about brain structure and function, and aspects of ongoing disease processes. Measures derived from these neuroimaging modalities have been studied through automated algorithms as potential predictors of disease outcomes. This proposal aims to introduce and evaluate new computerized algorithms, based on the field of machine learning that would incorporate not only brain imaging measures, but also biochemical and genetic information to create more powerful predictions of diagnostic and prognostic outcomes. Such novel, automated, multimodal predictors, we propose, may have important applications in future clinical decision making and clinical trial design. Brain imaging offers new quantitative measures that may be closer than cognitive assessments to the underlying biological mechanisms that lead to disease. By studying the associations of genetic factors with phenotypes based on cutting edge imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we plan to examine mechanistically meaningful genetic contributions to brain disorders. The rapidly expanding field of neuroimaging genetics will provide the nexus for the applicant's intensive training in the world-class imaging and genetics programs at the UCLA School of Medicine. This proposal will introduce new automated algorithms for gene discovery and risk prediction into the field of neuroimaging genetics. Algorithms that consider multiple genetic variants jointly, we propose, are likely to (1) more powerfully detect new gene effects on brain images, and (2) identify profiles of candidate genetic variants to assist prediction of an individual's brain integrity and risk for disease.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability across the world.

"Pattern analysis of large-scale functional connectivity to predict implicit emoti The current proposal is aimed at developing a novel neurobiological marker based on patterns of whole-brain functional connectivity during implicit and subliminal threat-related facial emotion perception to aid the diagnosis and assessment of treatment response in social anxiety (SAD) and panic disorder (PD). The following Specific Aims are proposed:    Specific Aim 1). Develop, apply and validate an approach to estimate the large-scale functional networks of implicit and subliminal threat-related and ambiguous facial emotion processing in a healthy control subject pool.    We will perform this by first testing whether large-scale partial correlations measured during a particular condition (i.e. presentation of visible or invisible fearful and neutral faces) can be used as features to predict the stimulus type presented during the condition (Sub-aim 1a). We will then test whether the most informative features for predicting fearful vs. neutral face conditions are connections among primarily limbic and paralimbic nodes, and that the most informative features in predicting neutral vs. resting states conditions are connections among primarily attention, motor and sensory related regions (Sub-aim 1b).    Specific Aim 2). Determine whether the approach developed in SA1 may have potential clinical application towards the diagnosis and treatment of SAD and PD.    We will perform this by testing whether the above functional networks are informative brain signatures that can be used to discriminate between healthy controls, SAD and PD subjects (Sub-aim 2a). We will also test whether the approach can be used to determine the particular sub-networks that are aberrant in SAD and PD (Sub-aim 2b). PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed approach may contribute toward the development of effective biomarkers in the diagnosis of SAD and PD. It may also identify the functional connections whose patterns differ between control and SAD, control and PD, and SAD and PD.

"Independent Component Analysis Based Support Vector Machine Classification Method    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional MRI (fMRI) techniques have provided the addiction field with a unique and profoundly valuable ability to explore brain mechanisms in human subjects. Despite the resultant advances in our understanding of neural mechanisms, the diagnostic utility of neuroimaging methods has not been realized. In addition, our ability to assess the reactivity of neural networks over time remains limited. To explore new approaches to further our understanding and diagnosis of substance use disorders, this proposal will utilize novel and powerful analytic methods to assess an existing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data set in cocaine-addicted subjects and healthy controls. The PI, new to the substance abuse field, will bring analytic approaches developed in other areas of investigation to the field of addiction. The broad goal of this project is to examine differentiations of brain functions in cocaine-addicted subjects using fMRI data and to reveal functional connectivity between regions involving disinhibition and decision-making tasks. This study will exploit data from an ongoing NIDA-funded study, ""Impulsivity, Neural Deficits and Cocaine Addiction."" This study assesses BOLD response during a motor disinhibition task and a decision- making task of response reversal as well as basal measures of interconnectivity measures during rest. A data driven entropy-based algorithm, independent component analysis (ICA), will be used to extract spatially independent regions that show differences in addicted and control subjects (Aim 1). We hypothesize that the proposed method will identify certain groups of voxels (not necessarily spatially connected) serving separation of two groups who are under disinhibition and decision-making tasks. To uncover how the functional connectivity changes over time between those differentiated regions, we will perform dynamic (changes over short time) dynamic functional network connectivity (DFNC) analysis using various window sizes on time course (Aim 2). These findings are expected to reveal a temporal distinction between ICA-derived network changes in cocaine-addicted and healthy control populations. Since the first aim will find significantly discriminative clouds of voxels, we will use a machine-learning algorithm, the support vector machines (SVM), to automatically map a subject into one of the groups, cocaine-addicted or control, by using subject's fMRI data (Aim 3). We hypothesize that SVM based subject classification tool will provide high sensitivity in selection between the two groups. The framework potentially offers a useful clinical diagnostic instrument as well as demonstrating key brain neural differences between the groups. The last aim is designed to reveal dynamic connectivity between pairs of given anatomic regions of relevance, such as the mesial prefrontal cortex (PFC), inferior PFC, insular cortex, and anterior cingulate (for the disinhibition task) and the orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate (for the decision-making task). We hypothesize that a clear boundary will be observed in interaction patterns of two groups regarding two tasks. The contrast between brain regions in fMRI data of cocaine-addicted and control subjects will be investigated for the first time using very powerful data analysis tool (ICA) and will be used in classification framework of SVM. The proposal will bring together two extremely innovative techniques (DFNC and SVM) and a promising junior investigator into the field of addiction. The utilization of a pre-existing database offers a highly cost-effective approach to a clinically important, perplexing and persistent problem in the field.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The abuse and dependence of stimulants is a major public health problem with significant health, legal, social and occupational associated costs. While biologically-oriented studies, particularly those using imaging techniques, have produced significant advances in our understanding of brain activity relevant to the development and persistence of addiction, this knowledge has done little to assist in the diagnosis of these disorders. This study will bring statistical procedures used in other fields of research to imaging data obtained from cocaine-addicted subjects to assess changes in brain networks and determine whether the cocaine-addicted patients can be distinguished from non-cocaine using subjects.            The abuse and dependence of stimulants is a major public health problem with significant health, legal, social and occupational associated costs.

"Fusion of Electromagnetic Brain Imaging and fMRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multimodal non-invasive functional brain imaging has made a tremendous impact in improving our understanding of the neural correlates of human behavior, and is now an indispensable tool for systems and cognitive neuroscientists. We propose to develop state-of-the-art multimodal functional imaging fusion algorithms for accurate visualization of the brain's dynamic activity and high spatial and temporal resolution. We propose to develop algorithms that combine complementary high spatial resolution of functional MRI (fMRI) and high-temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) data for high-fidelity reconstruction of brain activity. In recent years, our research group has developed a suite of novel and powerful algorithms for MEG/EEG imaging superior to existing benchmark algorithms, and we have compared these results with electrocorticography (ECOG). Specifically, our algorithms can solve for many brain sources, including sources located far from the sensors, in the presence of large interference from unrelated brain sources using fast and robust probabilistic inference techniques. Here, we propose to extend this success in M/EEG inverse algorithms into the domain of multimodal imaging data fusion. Our overall goal here is to ultimately produce robust, high fidelity videos of event-related brain activation at a sub-millimeter and sub-millisecond resolution from noisy MEG/EEG and fMRI data using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we propose to extend a powerful new algorithm that we have recently developed, called Champagne, into two new fusion algorithms that combine fMRI, MEG and EEG data in different ways. Performance of both algorithms will first be rigorously evaluated in simulations, including performance comparisons with existing benchmark fusion algorithms. Algorithms will then tested for consistency on four fMRI-MEG+EEG datasets from healthy controls obtained for identical paradigms (auditory, motor, picture naming and verb-generation) and two fMRI-EEG datasets (face and motion perception). Additional validation studies will also be performed on fMRI-MEG/EEG datasets obtained from epilepsy patients and compared to electrocorticography (ECoG). Following successful testing and evaluation, all algorithms developed in this grant proposal, as well as example validation datasets, will be distributed using NUTMEG (nutmeg.berkeley.edu), an open-source software toolbox that we have developed.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Multimodal non-invasive functional brain imaging has made a tremendous impact in improving our understanding of the neural correlates of human behavior, and is now an indispensable tool for systems and cognitive neuroscientists.

"Noninvasive imaging-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to establish a strategy that will make neuronal electrical signaling detectable via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a whole-brain level. Our approach is built on the novel concept of using cell-adhesive micron-scale electronic devices to transduce neuronal potentials across the brain into magnetic field fluctuations. As part of our validation of these voltage-sensing microprobes, we also propose to implement a new, scalable method for simultaneous recording of MRI and electrophysiological data. The methods we propose to develop will be broadly applicable to problems in neurobiology, and will transform neuroscientists' ability to study integrative functions of the brain. Our microprobe approach will also help establish a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine and molecular imaging, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology. Recent work has dem- onstrated that micron-scale electrodes, coated with cell-adhesive molecules and juxtaposed against cultured cells allow recording of millivolt-scale action potentials, comparable to intracellular recordings. The current induced in a microelectrode can be converted into a modest, transient magnetic field if it is channeled into an inductor. In Specific Aim 1, we will model the magnetic fields produced by feasible currents in spiral or solenoidal microcoils of defined geometry, compute predicted effects on MRI signal amplitude and phase as a function of microprobe distribution, and fabricate the microprobes themselves. Preliminary calculations indicate that localized, transient fields of about 10 nT could be produced in individual 10-turn microcoils of 1 5m diameter. Magnetic fields of this order are greater than endogenous neuronal fields detected in tech- nologies like magnetoencephalography, and have been shown previously to be measurable by MRI in some contexts. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the ability of our microprobes to report action potentials from neu- ronal populations in MRI. The microdevices wil first be applied to cultured neurons or neural tissue slices and placed in an MRI scanner. Data series will be obtained using multiple protocols to detect variations of MRI signal due to variations in neuronal activity. If experiments in culture are successful, microprobes will be site-specifically injected into the cerebral cortex of anesthetized rats, and tested in an somatosensory stimu- lation paradigm. In Specific Aim 3, we will establish a simultaneous MRI and conventional electrophysiology approach to validate the novel MRI voltage probes directly. Performing electrophysiology in an MRI scanner is complicated by artifacts induced by the scanning hardware, in particular due to switched gradient fields. To circumvent this problem, we will measure neuronal potentials using differential recording from pairs of channels on tetrodes or modified tetrodes.

"Early Diagnosis of Human Prion Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human prion diseases, such as Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease (CJD), are difficult to diagnose and are of increasing public health concern due to the risk of transmission. Our dementia program is a major referral center for prion diseases in the United States with 952 potential CJD referrals over the past six years. We also are conducting the first ever US sporadic CJD (sCJD) treatment trial, sponsored by the NIH. Unfortunately, many cases of sCJD are misdiagnosed or are diagnosed too late in the course for any future potential treatment to be effective. We, and others, have shown that brain MRI has very high sensitivity and specificity for sCJD diagnosis. Unfortunately, the most widely used diagnostic criteria for sCJD, Revised 1998 WHO Criteria, are problematic for several reasons: 1. they require symptoms that often do not occur until late in the disease course; 2. they do not use MRI; 3. they use a surrogate biomarker in the spinal fluid, the 14-3-3 protein, which we have found lacks sensitivity and specificity; and 4. they rely on certain electroencephalography (EEG) findings that have low sensitivity, particularly earlier in the disease. We will prospectively evaluate 100 patients with sCJD, 20 patients with symptomatic gCJD, and 40 patients with asymptomatic (presymptomatic gCJD) and 80 with other forms of rapidly progressive dementia (RPDs) over five years. We will conduct comprehensive assessments, including clinical, behavioral, spinal fluid surrogate marker, EEG, and MRI analyses. We will evaluate our gCJD at an age close to their predicted age of onset which will help us to identify the earliest signs of prion disease. A major focus will be to identify specific regions and patterns of abnormality on FLAIR and DTI MRI that can differentiate sCJD from other RPDs. Through this prospectively acquired data, we will devise a state of the art diagnostic scheme, using contemporary statistical classification techniques and logistic regression, for early diagnosis of sCJD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prion diseases are uniformly fatal, transmissible neurodegenerative diseases. At least one form can be transmitted by blood transfusion, and prions have now been found in several other tissues outside of the nervous system, including muscle, lymphoreticular tissues, and olfactory epithelia. Through earlier diagnosis, patients may be spared unnecessary and time-consuming diagnostic procedures and have better chance of responding to potential treatments, and the risk of transmission can be greatly reduced.          n/a",Early Diagnosis of Human Prion Disease,8113956,R01AG031189,"['Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologist', 'Olfactory Epithelium', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prion Diseases', 'Prions', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serological', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'base', 'cohort', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'forest', 'improved', 'meetings', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'programs', 'tertiary care', 'transmission process', 'treatment program', 'treatment trial']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2011,475594,685608202,0.004802182572785664
"Toward Individually-tailored Medicine: Probabilistic Models of Cerebral Aneurysms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding, both from incidental discovery on imaging studies and on autopsy; it is estimated that anywhere from 1-6% of the American population will develop this problem. Unfortunately, while our ability to detect ICAs has grown, our fundamental understanding of this disease entity remains lacking and significant debate continues in regards to its treatment. Given the high degree of mortality and comorbidity associated with ruptured intracranial aneurysms, it is imperative that new insights and approaches be developed to inform medical decision making involving ICAs. Thus, the objective of this proposal is the creation of an informatics infrastructure to help elucidate the genesis, progression, and treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Building from our efforts from the previous R01, a set of technical developments is outlined to transform the array of information routinely collected from clinical as- sessment of ICA patients into a Bayesian belief network (BBN) that models the disease. First, we evolve the concept of a phenomenon-centric data model (PCDM) as the basis for (temporally) organizing clinically-derived observations, enabling the model to be associated with processing pipelines that can identify and transform targeted variables from the content of clinical data sources. Through these pipelines, specific values in free- text reports (radiology, surgery, pathology, discharge summaries) and imaging studies will be automatically extracted into a scientific-quality database. Second, the PCDM schema for ICAs is mapped to a Bayesian belief network: the linkage between the PCDM and BBN allows automatic updating of the network and its progressive refinement from a growing dataset. The BBN's topology will be determined by clinical experts and conditional probabilities computed from the extracted clinical data. A basic graphical user interface (GUI) will permit users to interact with the BBN, aiding in medical decision making tasks. The GUI will allow a clinician to pose questions from either a set of common clinical queries or to create new queries: loading a patient's medical record into this application will automatically populate BBN variables with extracted information (i.e., from the pipelines). Each technical component of this proposal will be evaluated in a laboratory setting. In addition, the BBN will be tested for its predictive capabilities and compared to other statistical models to assess its potential in guiding ICA treatment. This proposal leverages a clinical collaboration with the UCLA Division of Interventional Neuroradiology, a leader in ICA research and treatment. A combined dataset of 2,000 retrospective and prospective subjects will be used to create the ICA database and BBN. Data collection will encompass a comprehensive set of variables including clinical presentation, imaging assessment (morphology, hemodynamics), histopathology, gene expression, treatment, and outcomes. We will additionally leverage the NIH/NINDS Human Genetic DNA and Cell Line Repository for additional ICA-related data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding on routine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) neuro-imaging studies. The associated mortality rate and comorbidity resultant from ruptured ICAs are extreme: subarachnoid hemorrhage causes 50% of individuals to die within one month of rupture, and more than one third of survivors develop major neurological deficits. Hence, the focus of this re- search is the creation of a comprehensive research database for ICA patients, using the spectrum of data routinely acquired in the diagnosis and treatment of the problem; from this database, a new probabilistic model of ICAs will be created, providing new insights into the disease and its optimal treatment for a given individual.           PROGRAM NARRATIVE Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding on routine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) neuro-imaging studies.

"Manipulating Neural Tissue with Ultra-Short Laser Pulses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We seek to renew our joint discovery and technology based bioengineering research partnership (BRP).  Our program advances the use of amplified ultrashort laser pulses as a tool to manipulate living and histological tissue.  This unique technology, pioneered by the BRP team, permits tissue to be cut on the micrometer scale by light-fueled plasma-meditated ablation.  Cutting occurs without thermal damage and can be combined with spectroscopic feedback to identify and limit the region being perturbed.  We advance this technology in new ways, including the use of temporal focusing for deep ablation, and apply it to three key test beds.  The first is construction of the angiotome, i.e., a complete vectorized map of cortical vasculature; here we use plasma mediated ablation to automate a form of block-face imaging along with novel algorithms to filter and vectorize features in the data.  The second is the study of neuronal viability in response to perturbations of subcortical blood flow; here we use plasma-mediated ablation to block flow in individual targeted microvessels that lie below the cortical surface.  The third test bed is the automation of cranial and spinal surgery; we combine plasma-mediated ablation with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy to cut bone yet avoid injury to soft tissue.  These investigations are particularly relevant to diagnosing and understanding microinfarctions, i.e., damage to the brain as the result of damage to single cortical vessels, that accumulate with age and trauma.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  These studies advance the use of light to image and manipulate the flow of blood in the brain.  We make use of rats and mice as model systems for our experiments.  The new capabilities from the proposed work hold two promises for advances in medicine:  One is an understanding of micro- infarctions - lesions of individual blood vessels in cortex that lead to the death of brain cells- that accrue with age and trauma.  The second is an understanding of the normal patterns of blood flow throughout the brain, which provide the basis for interpreting medical images of brain function.              Program Director (Last, first, middle): Kleinfeld, David, Kaufhold, John and Squier, Jeffrey.

"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase. Dementia has many possible underlying causes and several different causes are at work in most elderly demented subjects.

"Functional neuroimaging of language processing in primary progressive aphasia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a clinical syndrome in which degeneration of language regions in the dominant hemisphere is associated with progressive deficits in speech and/or language function. The overall goals of this project are to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural changes underlying linguistic deficits in PPA, and to use this information to better discriminate patients with variants of PPA from each other and from normal aging. Recent studies have identified three clinical variants of PPA: progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA), semantic dementia (SD) and logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA). Each variant is associated with characteristic linguistic features, distinct patterns of brain atrophy, and different likelihoods of particular underlying pathogenic processes, making correct differential diagnosis highly relevant. We will recruit 48 patients with PPA (16 of each variant) and 24 normal controls over a three year period, and acquire fMRI data along with structural MRI, linguistic and cognitive measures. The fMRI paradigm consists of a syntactic processing task with seven conditions parametrically varying in syntactic complexity. The research will address two specific aims. The first is to identify the relationships between volume loss, changes in functional MRI activation, and linguistic deficits, in the different PPA variants. The second aim is to improve differential diagnosis of PPA variants using machine learning algorithms incorporating both structural and functional imaging measures.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PPA is a devastating disorder that prevents individuals from communicating and functioning in society. The knowledge gained in this study will increase our understanding of the neural basis of language processing and its breakdown in PPA, and will contribute to earlier, more accurate differential diagnosis of PPA variants, enabling emerging therapies to be targeted to likely underlying etiologies.              PPA is a devastating disorder that prevents individuals from communicating and functioning in society.

"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.  Therefore, application of these algorithms is also likely to lead to eventual improvements in neural prosthetics for motor control and action.       n/a",Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems,7798636,R01MH066990,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Formulations', 'Engineering', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Intention', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'disease diagnosis', 'feeding', 'motor control', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2010,35821,148186688,0.034468563244185485
"High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Understanding normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and neonates is a key factor in early detection of developmental disorders. This project proposal seeks to develop and refine novel magnetic resonance image reconstruction and analysis methodology to allow, for the first time, the mapping of in-utero fetal brain development. One of the most common abnormalities detected by clinical imaging of the developing fetal brain is ventriculomegaly, which, despite the absence of other clinical or imaging findings, is associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities in infancy and childhood in up to 50% of cases. Although ultrasound allows diagnosis of the condition, it has not been able to distinguish those fetus that will have poor neurological outcome from those with normal outcome. Recent developments in fast magnetic resonance imaging have permitted the use of MRI to study the fetal anatomy and this technique is now being routinely used at a small number of sites around the world including UCSF. However, MR imaging of the fetal brain is still challenging because of imaging distortions caused by motion of the fetus within the mother and by artifacts caused by the surrounding maternal anatomy. Higher resolution or 3D acquisitions are not possible because of motion of the fetus during the acquisition time^ required. The current clinical 2D slice data individually provide limited resolution and contrast and, most importantly, often contain severe motion corruption between slices. This project is motivated by the observation that it is possible to apply computer vision and image processing techniques to correct relative motion between the multiple stacks of low resolution fetal slices, and create a single volumetric image with high isotropic 3D resolution and consistent geometry. Such higher resolution images provide structure that may be analyzed using computational morphometric techniques that can detect subtle focal differences in the pattern of tissue volume, location and surface folding. This project will combine such powerful techniques with extensive fetal and neonatal imaging experience at UCSF, allowing direct clinical application of the methodology to study morphologic aberrations associated with ventriculomegaly and to correlate these with clinical outcome. The ability to apply these computational techniques to in-utero data will provide an entirely new view of the developing brain, which promises to shed new light on early developmental problems both in fetuses and premature neonates.           n/a",High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI,7904306,R01NS055064,"['Anatomy', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evolution', 'Fetus', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurological outcome', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Premature Infant', 'Prematurity of fetus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'insight', 'neonate', 'novel', 'premature', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2010,48929,685608202,0.011660497126875155
"The Role of LFP Spatial Structure in the Hippocampus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this work is to understand how the activity of neurons is coordinated within the hippocampus, a brain region involved in the storage of memories. One manifestation of this coordination is the local field potential (LFP), the summed electrical activity of a small volume of neural tissue. Recently, multi- electrode arrays (MEAs) have enabled the simultaneous measurement of LFPs and single-neuron activity from multiple sites within the brain of an animal as it performs a task. This advance motivates the development of new computational methods that can identify the relationships that exist within these rich, large data sets. The temporal structure of hippocampal LFPs is known to correlate with single-neuron activity, as well as with behavioral state. In contrast, the spatial structure of these LFPs remains relatively unexplored. An interesting example of this spatial structure are the traveling LFP waves that propagate through the hippocampus. This project will examine whether the spatial dynamics of the hippocampal LFP influence neuronal activity and its relationship to behavior. Its aims are 1) to identify a parsimonious model for explaining the observed spatio- temporal structure in the LFP; 2) to investigate the relationship of LFP structure to single-neuron activity; and 3) to understand how LFP structure governs circuit-level neuronal processing within the hippocampus. To achieve these goals, this project will employ statistical learning techniques to extract spatio-temporal regularities from within the LFP, and use predictive models to examine the influence of different LFP structures on the population activity of hippocampal neurons. This work will identify concise metrics that capture the richness of high-dimensional hippocampal LFP measurements. Furthermore, it will examine the utility of incorporating complex dynamical features into current models of hippocampal processing. This work may help understand how distortions in electrical activity within the hippocampus lead to conditions such as epilepsy and amnesia. It will evaluate the suitability of the LFP as a direct target for neuroprosthetic interventions. Finally, it may lead to screening procedures for rapidly finding potential abnormalities in patients' brain activity, and help understand the implications of such abnormalities for patients' lifestyles.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a more complete description of the electrical waves of activity found in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that stores memories. These waves exhibit spatial patterns that may help guide the proper function of the hippocampus. This work could potentially explain how distortions in electrical activity relate to defects in people's abilities to form and recall memories.              Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop a more complete description of the electrical waves of activity found in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that stores memories.

"Functional neuroimaging of language processing in primary progressive aphasia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a clinical syndrome in which degeneration of language regions in the dominant hemisphere is associated with progressive deficits in speech and/or language function. The overall goals of this project are to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural changes underlying linguistic deficits in PPA, and to use this information to better discriminate patients with variants of PPA from each other and from normal aging. Recent studies have identified three clinical variants of PPA: progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA), semantic dementia (SD) and logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA). Each variant is associated with characteristic linguistic features, distinct patterns of brain atrophy, and different likelihoods of particular underlying pathogenic processes, making correct differential diagnosis highly relevant. We will recruit 48 patients with PPA (16 of each variant) and 24 normal controls over a three year period, and acquire fMRI data along with structural MRI, linguistic and cognitive measures. The fMRI paradigm consists of a syntactic processing task with seven conditions parametrically varying in syntactic complexity. The research will address two specific aims. The first is to identify the relationships between volume loss, changes in functional MRI activation, and linguistic deficits, in the different PPA variants. The second aim is to improve differential diagnosis of PPA variants using machine learning algorithms incorporating both structural and functional imaging measures.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PPA is a devastating disorder that prevents individuals from communicating and functioning in society. The knowledge gained in this study will increase our understanding of the neural basis of language processing and its breakdown in PPA, and will contribute to earlier, more accurate differential diagnosis of PPA variants, enabling emerging therapies to be targeted to likely underlying etiologies.              PPA is a devastating disorder that prevents individuals from communicating and functioning in society.

"Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compromised inhibitory control is a hallmark neuropsychological deficit underlying complex disorders and behaviors as drug addiction and aggression. Individuals with compromised mechanisms of control are difficult to identify unless they are subjected to challenging conditions directly. This is possibly due to the subtle ways in which poor inhibitory control is expressed in their baseline functioning, making classification and most importantly, prediction of future behavior, extremely challenging. We propose novel computational techniques to analyze brain-behavior relationships underlying mechanisms of inhibitory control, focusing on performing classification of hard-to-categorize groups of subjects based on brain activation response patterns to behavioral challenges of inhibitory control using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl). These classification methods are applied on two distinct datasets: one of substance dependent individuals and the other of individuals with a particular genotype conferring vulnerability to poor inhibitory control. We hypothesize that unique patterns of variability in brain function can assist in identification of brain mechanisms rooted in compromised inhibitory control. Such patterns will increase our understanding of brain connectivity and circuitry as we move iteratively between a-priori and exploratory means of describing circuits of inhibitory control. Machine Learning techniques have been shown to be successful in discovering optimal features and patterns in complex high dimensional datasets. The diversity of the underlying questions when studying inhibitory control and the subtlety of the effects that can be used for classification, motivate us to propose an integrated machine learning framework for the joint exploration of spatial, temporal and functional information for the analysis of fMRI signals, thus allowing the testing of hypotheses and development of applications that are not supported by traditional analysis methods. We hypothesize that: 1) A differential  spatial brain pattern will indicate a diagnosis of drug addiction and a membership in one or another level ol MAOA genotype. Spatial information from static 3D contrast maps will be input to PCA-based and Voxel-based methods, Adaboosting and Learning with Side information 2) A temporally accounted intrasubject pattern of response to the inhibitory control challenge conditions in the fMRI paradigms will reveal group membership in both data sets. Temporal fMRl information wilt be used for Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, etc. 3) A connectivity map corresponding to brain circuits functionally subserving inhibitory control wilt be revealed with indications of directionality of influence between brain regions by analyzing functional information with Dynamic Bayesian Networks, Dynamically Multi-Linked HMMs, etc. n/a",Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control,7761665,R01DA020949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Architectures', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Addiction', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'addiction', 'adverse outcome', 'approach behavior', 'assault', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'computer based statistical methods', 'improved', 'markov model', 'middle column', 'monoamine', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'programs', 'response']",NIDA,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2010,214701,77607041,0.01054600287159024
"High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Understanding normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and neonates is a key factor in early detection of developmental disorders. This project proposal seeks to develop and refine novel magnetic resonance image reconstruction and analysis methodology to allow, for the first time, the mapping of in-utero fetal brain development. One of the most common abnormalities detected by clinical imaging of the developing fetal brain is ventriculomegaly, which, despite the absence of other clinical or imaging findings, is associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities in infancy and childhood in up to 50% of cases. Although ultrasound allows diagnosis of the condition, it has not been able to distinguish those fetus that will have poor neurological outcome from those with normal outcome. Recent developments in fast magnetic resonance imaging have permitted the use of MRI to study the fetal anatomy and this technique is now being routinely used at a small number of sites around the world including UCSF. However, MR imaging of the fetal brain is still challenging because of imaging distortions caused by motion of the fetus within the mother and by artifacts caused by the surrounding maternal anatomy. Higher resolution or 3D acquisitions are not possible because of motion of the fetus during the acquisition time^ required. The current clinical 2D slice data individually provide limited resolution and contrast and, most importantly, often contain severe motion corruption between slices. This project is motivated by the observation that it is possible to apply computer vision and image processing techniques to correct relative motion between the multiple stacks of low resolution fetal slices, and create a single volumetric image with high isotropic 3D resolution and consistent geometry. Such higher resolution images provide structure that may be analyzed using computational morphometric techniques that can detect subtle focal differences in the pattern of tissue volume, location and surface folding. This project will combine such powerful techniques with extensive fetal and neonatal imaging experience at UCSF, allowing direct clinical application of the methodology to study morphologic aberrations associated with ventriculomegaly and to correlate these with clinical outcome. The ability to apply these computational techniques to in-utero data will provide an entirely new view of the developing brain, which promises to shed new light on early developmental problems both in fetuses and premature neonates.           n/a",High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI,8287830,R01NS055064,[' '],NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2010,223596,533302350,0.011660497126875155
"Early Diagnosis of Human Prion Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human prion diseases, such as Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease (CJD), are difficult to diagnose and are of increasing public health concern due to the risk of transmission. Our dementia program is a major referral center for prion diseases in the United States with 952 potential CJD referrals over the past six years. We also are conducting the first ever US sporadic CJD (sCJD) treatment trial, sponsored by the NIH. Unfortunately, many cases of sCJD are misdiagnosed or are diagnosed too late in the course for any future potential treatment to be effective. We, and others, have shown that brain MRI has very high sensitivity and specificity for sCJD diagnosis. Unfortunately, the most widely used diagnostic criteria for sCJD, Revised 1998 WHO Criteria, are problematic for several reasons: 1. they require symptoms that often do not occur until late in the disease course; 2. they do not use MRI; 3. they use a surrogate biomarker in the spinal fluid, the 14-3-3 protein, which we have found lacks sensitivity and specificity; and 4. they rely on certain electroencephalography (EEG) findings that have low sensitivity, particularly earlier in the disease. We will prospectively evaluate 100 patients with sCJD, 20 patients with symptomatic gCJD, and 40 patients with asymptomatic (presymptomatic gCJD) and 80 with other forms of rapidly progressive dementia (RPDs) over five years. We will conduct comprehensive assessments, including clinical, behavioral, spinal fluid surrogate marker, EEG, and MRI analyses. We will evaluate our gCJD at an age close to their predicted age of onset which will help us to identify the earliest signs of prion disease. A major focus will be to identify specific regions and patterns of abnormality on FLAIR and DTI MRI that can differentiate sCJD from other RPDs. Through this prospectively acquired data, we will devise a state of the art diagnostic scheme, using contemporary statistical classification techniques and logistic regression, for early diagnosis of sCJD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prion diseases are uniformly fatal, transmissible neurodegenerative diseases. At least one form can be transmitted by blood transfusion, and prions have now been found in several other tissues outside of the nervous system, including muscle, lymphoreticular tissues, and olfactory epithelia. Through earlier diagnosis, patients may be spared unnecessary and time-consuming diagnostic procedures and have better chance of responding to potential treatments, and the risk of transmission can be greatly reduced.          n/a",Early Diagnosis of Human Prion Disease,7904787,R01AG031189,"['Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Arts', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologist', 'Olfactory Epithelium', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prion Diseases', 'Prions', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serological', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'base', 'cohort', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'forest', 'improved', 'meetings', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'tertiary care', 'transmission process', 'treatment program', 'treatment trial']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2010,489910,685608202,0.004802182572785664
"Toward Individually-tailored Medicine: Probabilistic Models of Cerebral Aneurysms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding, both from incidental discovery on imaging studies and on autopsy; it is estimated that anywhere from 1-6% of the American population will develop this problem. Unfortunately, while our ability to detect ICAs has grown, our fundamental understanding of this disease entity remains lacking and significant debate continues in regards to its treatment. Given the high degree of mortality and comorbidity associated with ruptured intracranial aneurysms, it is imperative that new insights and approaches be developed to inform medical decision making involving ICAs. Thus, the objective of this proposal is the creation of an informatics infrastructure to help elucidate the genesis, progression, and treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Building from our efforts from the previous R01, a set of technical developments is outlined to transform the array of information routinely collected from clinical as- sessment of ICA patients into a Bayesian belief network (BBN) that models the disease. First, we evolve the concept of a phenomenon-centric data model (PCDM) as the basis for (temporally) organizing clinically-derived observations, enabling the model to be associated with processing pipelines that can identify and transform targeted variables from the content of clinical data sources. Through these pipelines, specific values in free- text reports (radiology, surgery, pathology, discharge summaries) and imaging studies will be automatically extracted into a scientific-quality database. Second, the PCDM schema for ICAs is mapped to a Bayesian belief network: the linkage between the PCDM and BBN allows automatic updating of the network and its progressive refinement from a growing dataset. The BBN's topology will be determined by clinical experts and conditional probabilities computed from the extracted clinical data. A basic graphical user interface (GUI) will permit users to interact with the BBN, aiding in medical decision making tasks. The GUI will allow a clinician to pose questions from either a set of common clinical queries or to create new queries: loading a patient's medical record into this application will automatically populate BBN variables with extracted information (i.e., from the pipelines). Each technical component of this proposal will be evaluated in a laboratory setting. In addition, the BBN will be tested for its predictive capabilities and compared to other statistical models to assess its potential in guiding ICA treatment. This proposal leverages a clinical collaboration with the UCLA Division of Interventional Neuroradiology, a leader in ICA research and treatment. A combined dataset of 2,000 retrospective and prospective subjects will be used to create the ICA database and BBN. Data collection will encompass a comprehensive set of variables including clinical presentation, imaging assessment (morphology, hemodynamics), histopathology, gene expression, treatment, and outcomes. We will additionally leverage the NIH/NINDS Human Genetic DNA and Cell Line Repository for additional ICA-related data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding on routine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) neuro-imaging studies. The associated mortality rate and comorbidity resultant from ruptured ICAs are extreme: subarachnoid hemorrhage causes 50% of individuals to die within one month of rupture, and more than one third of survivors develop major neurological deficits. Hence, the focus of this re- search is the creation of a comprehensive research database for ICA patients, using the spectrum of data routinely acquired in the diagnosis and treatment of the problem; from this database, a new probabilistic model of ICAs will be created, providing new insights into the disease and its optimal treatment for a given individual.           PROGRAM NARRATIVE Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding on routine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) neuro-imaging studies.

"Manipulating Neural Tissue with Ultra-Short Laser Pulses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We seek to renew our joint discovery and technology based bioengineering research partnership (BRP).  Our program advances the use of amplified ultrashort laser pulses as a tool to manipulate living and histological tissue.  This unique technology, pioneered by the BRP team, permits tissue to be cut on the micrometer scale by light-fueled plasma-meditated ablation.  Cutting occurs without thermal damage and can be combined with spectroscopic feedback to identify and limit the region being perturbed.  We advance this technology in new ways, including the use of temporal focusing for deep ablation, and apply it to three key test beds.  The first is construction of the angiotome, i.e., a complete vectorized map of cortical vasculature; here we use plasma mediated ablation to automate a form of block-face imaging along with novel algorithms to filter and vectorize features in the data.  The second is the study of neuronal viability in response to perturbations of subcortical blood flow; here we use plasma-mediated ablation to block flow in individual targeted microvessels that lie below the cortical surface.  The third test bed is the automation of cranial and spinal surgery; we combine plasma-mediated ablation with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy to cut bone yet avoid injury to soft tissue.  These investigations are particularly relevant to diagnosing and understanding microinfarctions, i.e., damage to the brain as the result of damage to single cortical vessels, that accumulate with age and trauma.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  These studies advance the use of light to image and manipulate the flow of blood in the brain.

"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging.

"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.  Therefore, application of these algorithms is also likely to lead to eventual improvements in neural prosthetics for motor control and action.       n/a",Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems,7616408,R01MH066990,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Formulations', 'Engineering', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Intention', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'disease diagnosis', 'feeding', 'motor control', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2009,35821,148186688,0.034468563244185485
"Bayesian Methods for Localizing Dynamic Brain Activity and Epileptogenic Zones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and related electroencephalography (EEG) use an array of sensors to non-invasively measure electromagnetic (EM) fields produced by synchronous current activity within the brain. While the temporal resolution is excellent relative to other functional imaging modalities, accurately localizing in 3D space the sources of brain activity involves solving a difficult, underdetermined inverse problem. Existing localization methods used clinically and for research purposes maintain significant shortcomings, including the inability to resolve complex source configurations, bias caused by source correlations, and sensitivity to sources of noise and interference. The latter can arise from eye blinks, heart beats, sensor imperfections, and industrial noise as well as from spontaneous background brain activity not associated with the brain sources of interest. Additionally, prototype algorithms ostensibly designed to deal with some of these issues are heuristic in nature and have not been rigorously evaluated or compared, making their ultimate utility difficult to assess for neuroelectromagnetic imaging practitioners. The proposed research plan addresses all of these concerns by developing a principled localization scheme that unifies and extends existing localization strategies using modern concepts from Bayesian statistics and machine learning. Based on the notion of automatic relevance determination (ARD), brain regions with probable (relevant) activity are located with high spatial resolution. Interference sources are effectively removed by integrating with a variation factor analysis model. To quantify the improvement afforded by the proposed methodology, source location estimates will be compared with standard algorithms using realistic simulations, near-ground-truth data obtained from invasive electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings, and surgical data. The result will be implemented as a user-friendly localization toolbox and made freely available to the community by integrating with existing open-source functional brain imaging software. Non-invasive mapping of brain activity with high spatio-temporal resolution has important consequences for basic neuroscience studies of human cognition. It also has profound implications for the diagnosis, characterization and treatment of various neurological, neurooncological, mental health, developmental, and communication disorders. For example, localizations of brain sources are used to map cognitive function in epileptogenic areas and in neighboring brain regions. Such brain mapping procedures are then useful to guide neurosurgical planning, navigation, and resection and to minimize post-operative deficits.           n/a",Bayesian Methods for Localizing Dynamic Brain Activity and Epileptogenic Zones,7751495,F32NS061395,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Automation', 'Bayesian Method', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blinking', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive Science', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Communication Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetic Fields', 'Electromagnetics', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Imaging', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Nutmeg - dietary', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resected', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'genetic pedigree', 'heuristics', 'human CYP2B6 protein', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'neurophysiology', 'open source', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2009,46257,685608202,0.023443078033729126
"Processing Discourse Reference in Mind and Brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research aims to uncover the functional and neural processes that underlie reference comprehension, especially with respect to the relation between reference form and referent salience. Explaining how reference is processed is critical for understanding natural language use, which crucially depends on the matching between referential expressions and real world referents. The specific hypothesis tested in this research is that the choice and processing of referential form reflect general memory processes that are involved in the representation of multiple referents and that are prone to interference, especially when the referents are salient. According to this ""interference view"", the use of general referential forms such as pronouns can reduce this interference and is therefore preferred when referents could be easily identified. At the neural level this hypothesis predicts that repeated full reference to salient referents would increase brain activation both in areas that are involved in the semantic representation of referents (e.g., regions in the temporal lobe for many types of object referents) and in areas that are known to support the manipulation and integration of multiple representations such as the areas around the intra parietal sulcus (IPS). Self paced reading and matching functional MRI (fMRI) experiments will test the central predictions of this view. The first prediction that will be tested is that behavioral and neural interference is associated with repeated reference to a salient referent but not to a non salient referent. The second prediction that will be tested is that not only repeated names (e.g., 'Joe') but also repeated definite description referents (e.g., 'the man') lead to behavioral and neural interference when the referent is salient. The third and last prediction that will be tested is that non repeated category definite description references (e.g., 'the bird' as a reference to 'the robin') lead to reduced interference similar to pronouns. Because little is currently known about the brain basis of referential processing, any data about these issues would be valuable. The application of converging behavioral and fMRI methodologies to this new theoretical account is unique in discourse research and holds promise for bridging functional accounts of discourse processes with their possible brain basis. Therefore, tying referential processing to underlying brain mechanisms would represent a major leap forward in terms of the scientific understanding of these issues. Such understanding is important for the diagnosis and treatment of language disorders, especially ones that involve deficits in referential processing such as Alzheimer's disease. The better understanding of these processes may also lead to methods and strategies for improving life quality in patients suffering from language disorders and their families.

"Bayesian Parallel Imaging For Arbitrarily Sampled MR Data Using Edge-Preserving S    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful imaging tool but many important clinical applications are limited by long scan times and/or poor SNR. This proposal aims to improve the speed of MRI without losing SNR, through a Bayesian inference approach. Improvement in scan speed can enable new time-critical clinical and diagnostic MR applications, like cardiac imaging, time-resolved 4D coronary angiography, high-resolution volumetric brain imaging, dynamic contrast enhanced imaging, etc. A Bayesian framework for the reconstruction of raw MR data from multiple coils in parallel will be developed. This framework makes it possible to reduce the time taken during scanning multiple times by reducing the sampling rate of raw MR data. Our method will be generally applicable to most MR imaging modalities, targets and sampling schemes. Our method will then be validated and tested on the specific clinical application of volumetric structural brain imaging, which is an important procedure for the detection and diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, tumors, white matter lesions, measuring brain atrophy and hippocampal subfields, etc. The main goal of this project is to create a set of computational tools to perform the reconstruction of accelerated MRI data on arbitrary imaging targets, modalities and acquisition schemes, including random sampling schemes. Design of models to capture prior spatial information about images will be undertaken. Finally, the method will be validated on structural brain data in terms of metrics like SNR, partial voluming, test- retest repeatability, and the performance of subsequent processing steps like image segmentation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project has the potential to make clinical MR imaging much faster than currently possible. This will make many time-critical clinical applications of MRI more feasible, for instance real-time MRI of the heart. The resolving power of MRI to image finer, clinically interesting anatomical features will also increase, making more reliable diagnosis possible.          n/a",Bayesian Parallel Imaging For Arbitrarily Sampled MR Data Using Edge-Preserving S,7688029,R21EB008138,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Formulations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heart', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical application', 'combinatorial', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'expectation', 'heart motion', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'model design', 'nervous system disorder', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'tumor', 'white matter']",NIBIB,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2009,211250,227555357,-0.00594531555336883
"Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compromised inhibitory control is a hallmark neuropsychological deficit underlying complex disorders and behaviors as drug addiction and aggression. Individuals with compromised mechanisms of control are difficult to identify unless they are subjected to challenging conditions directly. This is possibly due to the subtle ways in which poor inhibitory control is expressed in their baseline functioning, making classification and most importantly, prediction of future behavior, extremely challenging. We propose novel computational techniques to analyze brain-behavior relationships underlying mechanisms of inhibitory control, focusing on performing classification of hard-to-categorize groups of subjects based on brain activation response patterns to behavioral challenges of inhibitory control using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl). These classification methods are applied on two distinct datasets: one of substance dependent individuals and the other of individuals with a particular genotype conferring vulnerability to poor inhibitory control. We hypothesize that unique patterns of variability in brain function can assist in identification of brain mechanisms rooted in compromised inhibitory control. Such patterns will increase our understanding of brain connectivity and circuitry as we move iteratively between a-priori and exploratory means of describing circuits of inhibitory control. Machine Learning techniques have been shown to be successful in discovering optimal features and patterns in complex high dimensional datasets. The diversity of the underlying questions when studying inhibitory control and the subtlety of the effects that can be used for classification, motivate us to propose an integrated machine learning framework for the joint exploration of spatial, temporal and functional information for the analysis of fMRI signals, thus allowing the testing of hypotheses and development of applications that are not supported by traditional analysis methods. We hypothesize that: 1) A differential  spatial brain pattern will indicate a diagnosis of drug addiction and a membership in one or another level ol MAOA genotype. Spatial information from static 3D contrast maps will be input to PCA-based and Voxel-based methods, Adaboosting and Learning with Side information 2) A temporally accounted intrasubject pattern of response to the inhibitory control challenge conditions in the fMRI paradigms will reveal group membership in both data sets. Temporal fMRl information wilt be used for Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, etc. 3) A connectivity map corresponding to brain circuits functionally subserving inhibitory control wilt be revealed with indications of directionality of influence between brain regions by analyzing functional information with Dynamic Bayesian Networks, Dynamically Multi-Linked HMMs, etc. n/a",Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control,7599700,R01DA020949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Architectures', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Addiction', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'addiction', 'approach behavior', 'assault', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'computer based statistical methods', 'improved', 'markov model', 'middle column', 'monoamine', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'programs', 'response']",NIDA,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2009,216795,77607041,0.01054600287159024
"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging.

"High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Understanding normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and neonates is a key factor in early detection of developmental disorders. This project proposal seeks to develop and refine novel magnetic resonance image reconstruction and analysis methodology to allow, for the first time, the mapping of in-utero fetal brain development. One of the most common abnormalities detected by clinical imaging of the developing fetal brain is ventriculomegaly, which, despite the absence of other clinical or imaging findings, is associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities in infancy and childhood in up to 50% of cases. Although ultrasound allows diagnosis of the condition, it has not been able to distinguish those fetus that will have poor neurological outcome from those with normal outcome. Recent developments in fast magnetic resonance imaging have permitted the use of MRI to study the fetal anatomy and this technique is now being routinely used at a small number of sites around the world including UCSF. However, MR imaging of the fetal brain is still challenging because of imaging distortions caused by motion of the fetus within the mother and by artifacts caused by the surrounding maternal anatomy. Higher resolution or 3D acquisitions are not possible because of motion of the fetus during the acquisition time^ required. The current clinical 2D slice data individually provide limited resolution and contrast and, most importantly, often contain severe motion corruption between slices. This project is motivated by the observation that it is possible to apply computer vision and image processing techniques to correct relative motion between the multiple stacks of low resolution fetal slices, and create a single volumetric image with high isotropic 3D resolution and consistent geometry. Such higher resolution images provide structure that may be analyzed using computational morphometric techniques that can detect subtle focal differences in the pattern of tissue volume, location and surface folding. This project will combine such powerful techniques with extensive fetal and neonatal imaging experience at UCSF, allowing direct clinical application of the methodology to study morphologic aberrations associated with ventriculomegaly and to correlate these with clinical outcome. The ability to apply these computational techniques to in-utero data will provide an entirely new view of the developing brain, which promises to shed new light on early developmental problems both in fetuses and premature neonates.           n/a",High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI,7668441,R01NS055064,"['Anatomy', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evolution', 'Fetus', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurological outcome', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Premature Infant', 'Prematurity of fetus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'insight', 'neonate', 'novel', 'premature', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2009,275279,685608202,0.011660497126875155
"Massively Parallel Brain Imaging  I propose a disruptive technology that will revolutionize our understanding of brain function, development, and disease. Because the study of neural circuits remains deeply limited by a paucity of data, we need massively parallel approaches to brain imaging that will raise data acquisition rates by over two orders of magnitude. High-throughput technologies have already revolutionized certain areas of biology such as genomics and proteomics, but neuroscience has yet to experience a growth spurt of comparable magnitude. I will construct instrumentation allowing the brain volumes of ~100 alert flies to be imaged simultaneously by two-photon fluorescence microscopy. I have chosen the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, because of its small brain, its sophisticated behavioral repertoire, the large number of strains with genetically targeted alterations to brain circuitry, the utility of fluorescence imaging of neural activity in this species, and the importance of the fly as a model for the study of many brain diseases.  Massively parallel brain imaging will open entirely new avenues: 1) The ability to track neural dynamics across the brains of large numbers of normal flies and those with genetically induced neural circuit perturbations will revolutionize our understanding of how neural circuits produce animal behavior; 2) The now prominent role of the fruit fly as a model system for the study of developmental disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and addiction implies we will gain significant medical insights into devastating conditions; 3) Our technology will have important applications to drug screening, allowing the cellular effects of new compounds to be assessed rapidly in vivo; 4) The ability to perform high-throughput time-lapse imaging of cellular events during the maturation of fly embryos will allow an additional revolution in developmental neurobiology. Applications of our technology will also be plentiful in other model organisms such as nematodes and zebrafish, profoundly impacting multiple areas of biomedicine. n/a",Massively Parallel Brain Imaging,7683010,DP1OD003560,"['Ablation', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amplifiers', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Axon', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Budgets', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Caliber', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Cocaine', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer-Aided Design', 'Cornea', 'Crack Cocaine', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Dendrites', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fiber Optics', 'Figs - dietary', 'Five-Year Plans', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Heart', 'Heating', 'Hour', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Invertebrates', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Larva', 'Laser Scanning Microscopy', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lobe', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor Neurons', 'Movement Disorders', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nematoda', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleotides', 'Olfactory Receptor Neurons', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Photoreceptors', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Pigments', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Route', 'Safety', 'Sapphire', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Senile Plaques', 'Shapes', 'Silicon', 'Societies', 'Solutions', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Study models', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Synchrotrons', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Tea', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Tube', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Virion', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual Motion', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'addiction', 'age related', 'base', 'behavioral sensitization', 'brain volume', 'career', 'cellular imaging', 'cocaine exposure', 'commercialization', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'developmental neurobiology', 'digital', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'drug discovery', 'essays', 'experience', 'fluorescence imaging', 'fluorescence microscope', 'fly', 'genetic manipulation', 'genetic strain', 'high throughput screening', 'high throughput technology', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'lens', 'light microscopy', 'light scattering', 'meetings', 'member', 'minimally invasive', 'mouse genome', 'mutant', 'nanoscale', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurogenetics', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'object motion', 'optical imaging', 'optical traps', 'practical application', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'regenerative', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'selective expression', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'structural biology', 'success', 'tool', 'two-photon']",OD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,DP1,2009,395000,560644462,0.02812981631242997
"Early Diagnosis of Human Prion Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human prion diseases, such as Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease (CJD), are difficult to diagnose and are of increasing public health concern due to the risk of transmission. Our dementia program is a major referral center for prion diseases in the United States with 952 potential CJD referrals over the past six years. We also are conducting the first ever US sporadic CJD (sCJD) treatment trial, sponsored by the NIH. Unfortunately, many cases of sCJD are misdiagnosed or are diagnosed too late in the course for any future potential treatment to be effective. We, and others, have shown that brain MRI has very high sensitivity and specificity for sCJD diagnosis. Unfortunately, the most widely used diagnostic criteria for sCJD, Revised 1998 WHO Criteria, are problematic for several reasons: 1. they require symptoms that often do not occur until late in the disease course; 2. they do not use MRI; 3. they use a surrogate biomarker in the spinal fluid, the 14-3-3 protein, which we have found lacks sensitivity and specificity; and 4. they rely on certain electroencephalography (EEG) findings that have low sensitivity, particularly earlier in the disease. We will prospectively evaluate 100 patients with sCJD, 20 patients with symptomatic gCJD, and 40 patients with asymptomatic (presymptomatic gCJD) and 80 with other forms of rapidly progressive dementia (RPDs) over five years. We will conduct comprehensive assessments, including clinical, behavioral, spinal fluid surrogate marker, EEG, and MRI analyses. We will evaluate our gCJD at an age close to their predicted age of onset which will help us to identify the earliest signs of prion disease. A major focus will be to identify specific regions and patterns of abnormality on FLAIR and DTI MRI that can differentiate sCJD from other RPDs. Through this prospectively acquired data, we will devise a state of the art diagnostic scheme, using contemporary statistical classification techniques and logistic regression, for early diagnosis of sCJD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prion diseases are uniformly fatal, transmissible neurodegenerative diseases. At least one form can be transmitted by blood transfusion, and prions have now been found in several other tissues outside of the nervous system, including muscle, lymphoreticular tissues, and olfactory epithelia. Through earlier diagnosis, patients may be spared unnecessary and time-consuming diagnostic procedures and have better chance of responding to potential treatments, and the risk of transmission can be greatly reduced.          n/a",Early Diagnosis of Human Prion Disease,7682995,R01AG031189,"['Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Arts', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologist', 'Olfactory Epithelium', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prion Diseases', 'Prions', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serological', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'base', 'cohort', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'forest', 'improved', 'meetings', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'tertiary care', 'transmission process', 'treatment program', 'treatment trial']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2009,493771,685608202,0.004802182572785664
"Toward Individually-tailored Medicine: Probabilistic Models of Cerebral Aneurysms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding, both from incidental discovery on imaging studies and on autopsy; it is estimated that anywhere from 1-6% of the American population will develop this problem. Unfortunately, while our ability to detect ICAs has grown, our fundamental understanding of this disease entity remains lacking and significant debate continues in regards to its treatment. Given the high degree of mortality and comorbidity associated with ruptured intracranial aneurysms, it is imperative that new insights and approaches be developed to inform medical decision making involving ICAs. Thus, the objective of this proposal is the creation of an informatics infrastructure to help elucidate the genesis, progression, and treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Building from our efforts from the previous R01, a set of technical developments is outlined to transform the array of information routinely collected from clinical as- sessment of ICA patients into a Bayesian belief network (BBN) that models the disease. First, we evolve the concept of a phenomenon-centric data model (PCDM) as the basis for (temporally) organizing clinically-derived observations, enabling the model to be associated with processing pipelines that can identify and transform targeted variables from the content of clinical data sources. Through these pipelines, specific values in free- text reports (radiology, surgery, pathology, discharge summaries) and imaging studies will be automatically extracted into a scientific-quality database. Second, the PCDM schema for ICAs is mapped to a Bayesian belief network: the linkage between the PCDM and BBN allows automatic updating of the network and its progressive refinement from a growing dataset. The BBN's topology will be determined by clinical experts and conditional probabilities computed from the extracted clinical data. A basic graphical user interface (GUI) will permit users to interact with the BBN, aiding in medical decision making tasks. The GUI will allow a clinician to pose questions from either a set of common clinical queries or to create new queries: loading a patient's medical record into this application will automatically populate BBN variables with extracted information (i.e., from the pipelines). Each technical component of this proposal will be evaluated in a laboratory setting. In addition, the BBN will be tested for its predictive capabilities and compared to other statistical models to assess its potential in guiding ICA treatment. This proposal leverages a clinical collaboration with the UCLA Division of Interventional Neuroradiology, a leader in ICA research and treatment. A combined dataset of 2,000 retrospective and prospective subjects will be used to create the ICA database and BBN. Data collection will encompass a comprehensive set of variables including clinical presentation, imaging assessment (morphology, hemodynamics), histopathology, gene expression, treatment, and outcomes. We will additionally leverage the NIH/NINDS Human Genetic DNA and Cell Line Repository for additional ICA-related data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding on routine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) neuro-imaging studies. The associated mortality rate and comorbidity resultant from ruptured ICAs are extreme: subarachnoid hemorrhage causes 50% of individuals to die within one month of rupture, and more than one third of survivors develop major neurological deficits. Hence, the focus of this re- search is the creation of a comprehensive research database for ICA patients, using the spectrum of data routinely acquired in the diagnosis and treatment of the problem; from this database, a new probabilistic model of ICAs will be created, providing new insights into the disease and its optimal treatment for a given individual.           PROGRAM NARRATIVE Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding on routine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) neuro-imaging studies.

"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase. Dementia has many possible underlying causes and several different causes are at work in most elderly demented subjects. In this grant, we will use modern brain imaging to identify specific mechanisms underlying progression to dementia. n/a",Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging,7683735,R01AG011378,"['6-hydroxybenzothiazole', 'Abbreviations', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease Pathway', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Amyloidosis', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Applications Grants', 'Attenuated', 'Autopsy', 'Base of the Brain', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Correlation Studies', 'Critiques', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inositol', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'N-acetylaspartate', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pittsburgh Compound-B', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scheme', 'Senile Plaques', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Spin Labels', 'Staging', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Syndrome', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'amyloid imaging', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'molecular imaging', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'population based', 'primary outcome', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NIA,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2009,1043699,276703803,-0.017946869576625498
"Brain abnormality in unaffected family members of schizophrenic patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R03 proposal aims at developing a methodological framework for nonlinear multivariate analysis, using a non-linear pattern classification method, to identify and quantify subtle and spatially-complex brain abnormalities in unaffected family members of schizophrenia patients. Compared to conventional methods based on regions of interest (ROI) that rely only on a few pre-selected manually-labeled ROIs, this automated method will consider all brain regions simultaneously for identification of complex patterns of brain abnormality that cannot be necessarily summarized by a few pre-defined ROIs. Accordingly, a major methodological challenge to be addressed in this project is the development of statistical image analysis and data mining methods for estimating the collection of brain regions or networks that jointly form patterns to characterize schizophrenia as uniquely as possible. Patterns determined by comparison of confirmed schizophrenia patients and healthy controls will be examined on unaffected family members of patients, to test whether individuals that are genetically related to patients display, to some extent, endophenotypes of schizophrenia. Also, unaffected family members will be further compared with patients to identify the morphological profiles that seem directly associated with the phenotype of schizophrenia. The performance of the proposed nonlinear pattern analysis and classification method will be tested on an existing schizophrenia dataset in the Schizophrenia Research Center at the University of Pennsylvania. Although not an immediate goal of this specific proposal, the long-term objective of the proposed work is to apply this automated methodology to various studies, including (1) a large-scale genetic study of schizophrenia involving informative samples, in order to examine questions that cannot be addressed with conventional ROI-based analysis; (2) the quantification and recognition of endophenotypes of schizophrenia in unaffected individuals, which can potentially pave the way for the detection of adolescents that possess brain endophenotypes that put them at risk; (3) clinical studies investigating the added value of quantifying endophenotypes of schizophrenia for clinical diagnosis, especially in difficult cases or outside environments with well-trained psychiatrists, in which unbiased computer-based methods can potentially greatly assist in clinical evaluation and diagnosis.           n/a",Brain abnormality in unaffected family members of schizophrenic patients,7663443,R03MH076970,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Psychiatrist', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'data mining', 'endophenotype', 'gray matter', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'member', 'research clinical testing']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R03,2008,12825,511185245,0.011464890798089062
"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.  Therefore, application of these algorithms is also likely to lead to eventual improvements in neural prosthetics for motor control and action.       n/a",Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems,7392804,R01MH066990,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Drug Formulations', 'Engineering', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Intention', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Numbers', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'feeding', 'motor control', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2008,35821,148186688,0.034468563244185485

"Processing Discourse Reference in Mind and Brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research aims to uncover the functional and neural processes that underlie reference comprehension, especially with respect to the relation between reference form and referent salience. Explaining how reference is processed is critical for understanding natural language use, which crucially depends on the matching between referential expressions and real world referents. The specific hypothesis tested in this research is that the choice and processing of referential form reflect general memory processes that are involved in the representation of multiple referents and that are prone to interference, especially when the referents are salient. According to this ""interference view"", the use of general referential forms such as pronouns can reduce this interference and is therefore preferred when referents could be easily identified. At the neural level this hypothesis predicts that repeated full reference to salient referents would increase brain activation both in areas that are involved in the semantic representation of referents (e.g., regions in the temporal lobe for many types of object referents) and in areas that are known to support the manipulation and integration of multiple representations such as the areas around the intra parietal sulcus (IPS). Self paced reading and matching functional MRI (fMRI) experiments will test the central predictions of this view. The first prediction that will be tested is that behavioral and neural interference is associated with repeated reference to a salient referent but not to a non salient referent. The second prediction that will be tested is that not only repeated names (e.g., 'Joe') but also repeated definite description referents (e.g., 'the man') lead to behavioral and neural interference when the referent is salient. The third and last prediction that will be tested is that non repeated category definite description references (e.g., 'the bird' as a reference to 'the robin') lead to reduced interference similar to pronouns. Because little is currently known about the brain basis of referential processing, any data about these issues would be valuable. The application of converging behavioral and fMRI methodologies to this new theoretical account is unique in discourse research and holds promise for bridging functional accounts of discourse processes with their possible brain basis. Therefore, tying referential processing to underlying brain mechanisms would represent a major leap forward in terms of the scientific understanding of these issues. Such understanding is important for the diagnosis and treatment of language disorders, especially ones that involve deficits in referential processing such as Alzheimer's disease. The better understanding of these processes may also lead to methods and strategies for improving life quality in patients suffering from language disorders and their families. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Explaining how reference is processed is critical for understanding natural language use, which crucially depends on the matching between referential expressions and real world referents. Tying referential processing to underlying brain mechanisms would represent a major leap forward in terms of the scientific understanding of these issues. Such understanding is important for the diagnosis and treatment of language disorders, especially ones that involve deficits in referential processing such as Alzheimer's disease and may suggest methods and strategies for improving life quality in patients suffering from language disorders and their families.             n/a",Processing Discourse Reference in Mind and Brain,7471139,R21AG030445,"['Accounting', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Birds', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Compatible', 'Complement component C1s', 'Comprehension', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Inferior', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Reading', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Robin bird', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Sulcus', 'Testing', 'Work', 'base', 'improved', 'man', 'memory process', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R21,2008,146800,45219910,0.0002887032877512304
"Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compromised inhibitory control is a hallmark neuropsychological deficit underlying complex disorders and behaviors as drug addiction and aggression. Individuals with compromised mechanisms of control are difficult to identify unless they are subjected to challenging conditions directly. This is possibly due to the subtle ways in which poor inhibitory control is expressed in their baseline functioning, making classification and most importantly, prediction of future behavior, extremely challenging. We propose novel computational techniques to analyze brain-behavior relationships underlying mechanisms of inhibitory control, focusing on performing classification of hard-to-categorize groups of subjects based on brain activation response patterns to behavioral challenges of inhibitory control using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl). These classification methods are applied on two distinct datasets: one of substance dependent individuals and the other of individuals with a particular genotype conferring vulnerability to poor inhibitory control. We hypothesize that unique patterns of variability in brain function can assist in identification of brain mechanisms rooted in compromised inhibitory control. Such patterns will increase our understanding of brain connectivity and circuitry as we move iteratively between a-priori and exploratory means of describing circuits of inhibitory control. Machine Learning techniques have been shown to be successful in discovering optimal features and patterns in complex high dimensional datasets. The diversity of the underlying questions when studying inhibitory control and the subtlety of the effects that can be used for classification, motivate us to propose an integrated machine learning framework for the joint exploration of spatial, temporal and functional information for the analysis of fMRI signals, thus allowing the testing of hypotheses and development of applications that are not supported by traditional analysis methods. We hypothesize that: 1) A differential  spatial brain pattern will indicate a diagnosis of drug addiction and a membership in one or another level ol MAOA genotype. Spatial information from static 3D contrast maps will be input to PCA-based and Voxel-based methods, Adaboosting and Learning with Side information 2) A temporally accounted intrasubject pattern of response to the inhibitory control challenge conditions in the fMRI paradigms will reveal group membership in both data sets. Temporal fMRl information wilt be used for Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, etc. 3) A connectivity map corresponding to brain circuits functionally subserving inhibitory control wilt be revealed with indications of directionality of influence between brain regions by analyzing functional information with Dynamic Bayesian Networks, Dynamically Multi-Linked HMMs, etc. n/a",Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control,7440338,R01DA020949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Architectures', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Addiction', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'addiction', 'approach behavior', 'assault', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'computer based statistical methods', 'human study', 'improved', 'markov model', 'middle column', 'monoamine', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'programs', 'response']",NIDA,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2008,216244,77607041,0.01054600287159024
"Bayesian Parallel Imaging For Arbitrarily Sampled MR Data Using Edge-Preserving S    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful imaging tool but many important clinical applications are limited by long scan times and/or poor SNR. This proposal aims to improve the speed of MRI without losing SNR, through a Bayesian inference approach. Improvement in scan speed can enable new time-critical clinical and diagnostic MR applications, like cardiac imaging, time-resolved 4D coronary angiography, high-resolution volumetric brain imaging, dynamic contrast enhanced imaging, etc. A Bayesian framework for the reconstruction of raw MR data from multiple coils in parallel will be developed. This framework makes it possible to reduce the time taken during scanning multiple times by reducing the sampling rate of raw MR data. Our method will be generally applicable to most MR imaging modalities, targets and sampling schemes. Our method will then be validated and tested on the specific clinical application of volumetric structural brain imaging, which is an important procedure for the detection and diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, tumors, white matter lesions, measuring brain atrophy and hippocampal subfields, etc. The main goal of this project is to create a set of computational tools to perform the reconstruction of accelerated MRI data on arbitrary imaging targets, modalities and acquisition schemes, including random sampling schemes. Design of models to capture prior spatial information about images will be undertaken. Finally, the method will be validated on structural brain data in terms of metrics like SNR, partial voluming, test- retest repeatability, and the performance of subsequent processing steps like image segmentation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project has the potential to make clinical MR imaging much faster than currently possible. This will make many time-critical clinical applications of MRI more feasible, for instance real-time MRI of the heart. The resolving power of MRI to image finer, clinically interesting anatomical features will also increase, making more reliable diagnosis possible.          n/a",Bayesian Parallel Imaging For Arbitrarily Sampled MR Data Using Edge-Preserving S,7528771,R21EB008138,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blur', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Class', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Condition', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Formulations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heart', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Pulse taking', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical application', 'combinatorial', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'expectation', 'heart motion', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'model design', 'nervous system disorder', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'tumor', 'white matter']",NIBIB,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2008,252375,227555357,-0.00594531555336883
"High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Understanding normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and neonates is a key factor in early detection of developmental disorders. This project proposal seeks to develop and refine novel magnetic resonance image reconstruction and analysis methodology to allow, for the first time, the mapping of in-utero fetal brain development. One of the most common abnormalities detected by clinical imaging of the developing fetal brain is ventriculomegaly, which, despite the absence of other clinical or imaging findings, is associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities in infancy and childhood in up to 50% of cases. Although ultrasound allows diagnosis of the condition, it has not been able to distinguish those fetus that will have poor neurological outcome from those with normal outcome. Recent developments in fast magnetic resonance imaging have permitted the use of MRI to study the fetal anatomy and this technique is now being routinely used at a small number of sites around the world including UCSF. However, MR imaging of the fetal brain is still challenging because of imaging distortions caused by motion of the fetus within the mother and by artifacts caused by the surrounding maternal anatomy. Higher resolution or 3D acquisitions are not possible because of motion of the fetus during the acquisition time^ required. The current clinical 2D slice data individually provide limited resolution and contrast and, most importantly, often contain severe motion corruption between slices. This project is motivated by the observation that it is possible to apply computer vision and image processing techniques to correct relative motion between the multiple stacks of low resolution fetal slices, and create a single volumetric image with high isotropic 3D resolution and consistent geometry. Such higher resolution images provide structure that may be analyzed using computational morphometric techniques that can detect subtle focal differences in the pattern of tissue volume, location and surface folding. This project will combine such powerful techniques with extensive fetal and neonatal imaging experience at UCSF, allowing direct clinical application of the methodology to study morphologic aberrations associated with ventriculomegaly and to correlate these with clinical outcome. The ability to apply these computational techniques to in-utero data will provide an entirely new view of the developing brain, which promises to shed new light on early developmental problems both in fetuses and premature neonates.           n/a",High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI,7469332,R01NS055064,"['Anatomy', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evolution', 'Fetus', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infant Development', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurological outcome', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Premature Infant', 'Range', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'insight', 'neonate', 'novel', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2008,275279,685608202,0.011660497126875155

"Early Diagnosis of Human Prion Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human prion diseases, such as Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease (CJD), are difficult to diagnose and are of increasing public health concern due to the risk of transmission. Our dementia program is a major referral center for prion diseases in the United States with 952 potential CJD referrals over the past six years. We also are conducting the first ever US sporadic CJD (sCJD) treatment trial, sponsored by the NIH. Unfortunately, many cases of sCJD are misdiagnosed or are diagnosed too late in the course for any future potential treatment to be effective. We, and others, have shown that brain MRI has very high sensitivity and specificity for sCJD diagnosis. Unfortunately, the most widely used diagnostic criteria for sCJD, Revised 1998 WHO Criteria, are problematic for several reasons: 1. they require symptoms that often do not occur until late in the disease course; 2. they do not use MRI; 3. they use a surrogate biomarker in the spinal fluid, the 14-3-3 protein, which we have found lacks sensitivity and specificity; and 4. they rely on certain electroencephalography (EEG) findings that have low sensitivity, particularly earlier in the disease. We will prospectively evaluate 100 patients with sCJD, 20 patients with symptomatic gCJD, and 40 patients with asymptomatic (presymptomatic gCJD) and 80 with other forms of rapidly progressive dementia (RPDs) over five years. We will conduct comprehensive assessments, including clinical, behavioral, spinal fluid surrogate marker, EEG, and MRI analyses. We will evaluate our gCJD at an age close to their predicted age of onset which will help us to identify the earliest signs of prion disease. A major focus will be to identify specific regions and patterns of abnormality on FLAIR and DTI MRI that can differentiate sCJD from other RPDs. Through this prospectively acquired data, we will devise a state of the art diagnostic scheme, using contemporary statistical classification techniques and logistic regression, for early diagnosis of sCJD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prion diseases are uniformly fatal, transmissible neurodegenerative diseases. At least one form can be transmitted by blood transfusion, and prions have now been found in several other tissues outside of the nervous system, including muscle, lymphoreticular tissues, and olfactory epithelia. Through earlier diagnosis, patients may be spared unnecessary and time-consuming diagnostic procedures and have better chance of responding to potential treatments, and the risk of transmission can be greatly reduced.          n/a",Early Diagnosis of Human Prion Disease,7526427,R01AG031189,"['Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Arts', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Condition', 'Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Invasive', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologist', 'Numbers', 'Olfactory Epithelium', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prion Diseases', 'Prions', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Rate', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serological', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'cohort', 'experience', 'forest', 'improved', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'programs', 'tertiary care', 'transmission process', 'treatment program', 'treatment trial']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2008,498510,685608202,0.004802182572785664
"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase. Dementia has many possible underlying causes and several different causes are at work in most elderly demented subjects.

"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.  Therefore, application of these algorithms is also likely to lead to eventual improvements in neural prosthetics for motor control and action.       n/a",Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems,7269518,R01MH066990,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Drug Formulations', 'Engineering', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Intention', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Numbers', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'feeding', 'motor control', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2007,35821,148186688,0.034468563244185485
"Brain abnormality in unaffected family members of schizophrenic patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R03 proposal aims at developing a methodological framework for nonlinear multivariate analysis, using a non-linear pattern classification method, to identify and quantify subtle and spatially-complex brain abnormalities in unaffected family members of schizophrenia patients. Compared to conventional methods based on regions of interest (ROI) that rely only on a few pre-selected manually-labeled ROIs, this automated method will consider all brain regions simultaneously for identification of complex patterns of brain abnormality that cannot be necessarily summarized by a few pre-defined ROIs. Accordingly, a major methodological challenge to be addressed in this project is the development of statistical image analysis and data mining methods for estimating the collection of brain regions or networks that jointly form patterns to characterize schizophrenia as uniquely as possible. Patterns determined by comparison of confirmed schizophrenia patients and healthy controls will be examined on unaffected family members of patients, to test whether individuals that are genetically related to patients display, to some extent, endophenotypes of schizophrenia. Also, unaffected family members will be further compared with patients to identify the morphological profiles that seem directly associated with the phenotype of schizophrenia. The performance of the proposed nonlinear pattern analysis and classification method will be tested on an existing schizophrenia dataset in the Schizophrenia Research Center at the University of Pennsylvania. Although not an immediate goal of this specific proposal, the long-term objective of the proposed work is to apply this automated methodology to various studies, including (1) a large-scale genetic study of schizophrenia involving informative samples, in order to examine questions that cannot be addressed with conventional ROI-based analysis; (2) the quantification and recognition of endophenotypes of schizophrenia in unaffected individuals, which can potentially pave the way for the detection of adolescents that possess brain endophenotypes that put them at risk; (3) clinical studies investigating the added value of quantifying endophenotypes of schizophrenia for clinical diagnosis, especially in difficult cases or outside environments with well-trained psychiatrists, in which unbiased computer-based methods can potentially greatly assist in clinical evaluation and diagnosis.           n/a",Brain abnormality in unaffected family members of schizophrenic patients,7195436,R03MH076970,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Psychiatrist', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'data mining', 'endophenotype', 'gray matter', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'member', 'research clinical testing']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R03,2007,78604,593605914,0.011464890798089062
"Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compromised inhibitory control is a hallmark neuropsychological deficit underlying complex disorders and behaviors as drug addiction and aggression. Individuals with compromised mechanisms of control are difficult to identify unless they are subjected to challenging conditions directly. This is possibly due to the subtle ways in which poor inhibitory control is expressed in their baseline functioning, making classification and most importantly, prediction of future behavior, extremely challenging. We propose novel computational techniques to analyze brain-behavior relationships underlying mechanisms of inhibitory control, focusing on performing classification of hard-to-categorize groups of subjects based on brain activation response patterns to behavioral challenges of inhibitory control using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl). These classification methods are applied on two distinct datasets: one of substance dependent individuals and the other of individuals with a particular genotype conferring vulnerability to poor inhibitory control. We hypothesize that unique patterns of variability in brain function can assist in identification of brain mechanisms rooted in compromised inhibitory control. Such patterns will increase our understanding of brain connectivity and circuitry as we move iteratively between a-priori and exploratory means of describing circuits of inhibitory control. Machine Learning techniques have been shown to be successful in discovering optimal features and patterns in complex high dimensional datasets. The diversity of the underlying questions when studying inhibitory control and the subtlety of the effects that can be used for classification, motivate us to propose an integrated machine learning framework for the joint exploration of spatial, temporal and functional information for the analysis of fMRI signals, thus allowing the testing of hypotheses and development of applications that are not supported by traditional analysis methods. We hypothesize that: 1) A differential  spatial brain pattern will indicate a diagnosis of drug addiction and a membership in one or another level ol MAOA genotype. Spatial information from static 3D contrast maps will be input to PCA-based and Voxel-based methods, Adaboosting and Learning with Side information 2) A temporally accounted intrasubject pattern of response to the inhibitory control challenge conditions in the fMRI paradigms will reveal group membership in both data sets. Temporal fMRl information wilt be used for Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, etc. 3) A connectivity map corresponding to brain circuits functionally subserving inhibitory control wilt be revealed with indications of directionality of influence between brain regions by analyzing functional information with Dynamic Bayesian Networks, Dynamically Multi-Linked HMMs, etc. n/a",Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control,7127674,R01DA020949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Architectures', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Addiction', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'addiction', 'approach behavior', 'assault', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'computer based statistical methods', 'human study', 'improved', 'markov model', 'middle column', 'monoamine', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'programs', 'response']",NIDA,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2007,220117,77607041,0.01054600287159024
"High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Understanding normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and neonates is a key factor in early detection of developmental disorders. This project proposal seeks to develop and refine novel magnetic resonance image reconstruction and analysis methodology to allow, for the first time, the mapping of in-utero fetal brain development. One of the most common abnormalities detected by clinical imaging of the developing fetal brain is ventriculomegaly, which, despite the absence of other clinical or imaging findings, is associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities in infancy and childhood in up to 50% of cases. Although ultrasound allows diagnosis of the condition, it has not been able to distinguish those fetus that will have poor neurological outcome from those with normal outcome. Recent developments in fast magnetic resonance imaging have permitted the use of MRI to study the fetal anatomy and this technique is now being routinely used at a small number of sites around the world including UCSF. However, MR imaging of the fetal brain is still challenging because of imaging distortions caused by motion of the fetus within the mother and by artifacts caused by the surrounding maternal anatomy. Higher resolution or 3D acquisitions are not possible because of motion of the fetus during the acquisition time^ required. The current clinical 2D slice data individually provide limited resolution and contrast and, most importantly, often contain severe motion corruption between slices. This project is motivated by the observation that it is possible to apply computer vision and image processing techniques to correct relative motion between the multiple stacks of low resolution fetal slices, and create a single volumetric image with high isotropic 3D resolution and consistent geometry. Such higher resolution images provide structure that may be analyzed using computational morphometric techniques that can detect subtle focal differences in the pattern of tissue volume, location and surface folding. This project will combine such powerful techniques with extensive fetal and neonatal imaging experience at UCSF, allowing direct clinical application of the methodology to study morphologic aberrations associated with ventriculomegaly and to correlate these with clinical outcome. The ability to apply these computational techniques to in-utero data will provide an entirely new view of the developing brain, which promises to shed new light on early developmental problems both in fetuses and premature neonates.           n/a",High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI,7241562,R01NS055064,"['Anatomy', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evolution', 'Fetus', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infant Development', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurological outcome', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Premature Infant', 'Range', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'insight', 'neonate', 'novel', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO,R01,2007,275279,0,0.011660497126875155
"A Non-invasive Single-trial In-vivo Neuroimaging System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The overall goal of this project is to develop an integrated single-trial system for neuroimaging which combines high-density electroencephalography (EEG) with simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and to use this system to investigate variability in neural processing. The high-temporal resolution of EEG will enable the detection of signal variability in single-trial events, and this information will be used as the input function for analysis of simultaneously acquired event-related fMRI (efMRl). We hypothesize that using single-trial EEG derived regressors for efMRI (stEEG/fMRI) will yield high spatial and high temporal resolution information about the functional neuroanatomy involved in cognitive processing. This will enable construction of unique EEG derived tMRI activation maps which are not based on pre-defined labels or observed behavioral responses but rather on task and subject specific electrophysiological source variability. The broad impact of this work will be development of a new non-invasive imaging system (stEEG/fMRI) for the cognitive neurosciences as well as a clinical tool for diagnosis and monitoring of a broad spectrum of neurological diseases. The R21 effort focuses on development of a high density (64 channels) EEG/fMRI integrated system for single-trial analysis, and characterization of possible differences between the EEG recorded in an MR environment and that recorded in a standard environment. The R33 will then demonstrate the use of stEEG/fMRI in a pilot study of cognitive aging. R21Aims: 1. Develop an in-magnet 64 channel EEG system for single-trial analysis of event-related potentials recorded concurrently with fMRI. 2. Assess the quality of EEG collected inside the MR scanner compared to that collected in a shielded EEG room, using a series of predefined protocols for characterizing the effects of the auditory and magnetic environments on EEG and ERP wave forms. 3. Validate that EEG recorded simultaneously with fMRI is of a high enough quality to detect task relevant single-trial signatures using supervised machine learning. R33 Aims: 1.Use single-trial EEG-derived regressors, constructed via supervised machine learning, to construct efMRI activation maps (stEEG/fMRI activation maps) for auditory oddball and Eriksen flanker tasks. 2.Use alpha power as a complementary regressor within stEEG/fMRI for capturing additional single-trial variance in the hemodynamic response. 3.Demonstrate that stEEG/tMRI activations maps yield new information for discriminating young and old adult populations, as compared to traditional efMRI and P3 and ERN ERP analysis. n/a",A Non-invasive Single-trial In-vivo Neuroimaging System,7274139,R33EB004730,"['Auditory', 'Behavioral', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Invasive', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Maps', 'Monitor', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'density', 'hemodynamics', 'in vivo', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'tool']",NIBIB,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R33,2007,432581,61807989,0.011158493007608896

"Novel TIRF microscopy analyzing trafficking & signaling at the cell cortex My major goal is to advance knowledge about events on or near the plasma membrane. This region directly controls membrane traffic to and from the cell surface (exo- and endocytosis) and is where extracellular signals are amplified and modulated by assembly of signaling scaffolds. The introduction of total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, a technique that allows unprecedented axial resolution, has revolutionized studies of dynamic processes at the cell cortex. I propose 1) to develop two highly innovative multi-angle TIRF microscopes and 2) to apply these instruments towards the elucidation of mechanisms that regulate exo- and endocytosis. These microscopes will allow the penetration depth of the light beam to be varied rapidly and avoid traditional imaging artifacts. Together with new analytical methods, they will permit high-resolution 3D imaging of a ~50- 1000 nanometer cortical region of living cells. Additionally, a highly innovative FRAP implementation will allow us to `pulse' photoactivate single vesicles and track their fate. I will use this novel instrumentation to expand our ongoing studies on exo- and endocytic traffic. A main new goal will be to elucidate mechanisms in the vesicular trafficking pathways that regulate levels of glucose transporters (Glut4) at the cell surface, a process whose dysfunction leads to type 2 diabetes. I will test the hypothesis that the exocyst complex participates in the spatial regulation of the insulin responsiveness of Glut4 vesicle exocytosis. Using photoactivatable Glut4-Dendra I will determine whether insulin signaling triggers a switch from lipid raft to clathrin-mediated endocytic pathways. To address where PI3K signaling acts, I will implement inducible dimerization technology to rapidly turn on/off PI(3,4,5)P3 at the plasma membrane. The innovative approaches of this proposal capitalize on my unique expertise in interdisciplinary research spanning instrumentation, cell biology, and quantitative biology and will fundamentally impact biology and a medically important field. n/a",Novel TIRF microscopy analyzing trafficking & signaling at the cell cortex,7432044,DP2OD002980,"['1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase', 'Abbreviations', 'Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adipocytes', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Boxing', 'Buffers', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Cell Line', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clathrin', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Collimator', 'Color', 'Coma', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Dimerization', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discipline', 'Docking', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drops', 'Dyes', 'Employee Strikes', 'Endocytosis', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exocytosis', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Figs - dietary', 'Flare', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic Screening', 'Germany', 'Glass', 'Glucose Transporter', 'Glycerol', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Insulin', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Length', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Localized', 'Location', 'Macromolecular Complexes', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Microdomains', 'Membrane Protein Traffic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Optics', 'Organelles', 'PTEN gene', 'Paper', 'Parasites', 'Pathway interactions', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phosphatidylinositols', 'Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase, Catalytic, Gamma Polypeptide', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Photobleaching', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Planet Mars', 'Play', 'Pliability', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Private Sector', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Pulse taking', 'Pupil', 'Quantum Dots', 'RNA Interference', 'Radial', 'Randomized', 'Range', 'Reagent', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Refractive Indices', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Side', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Solid', 'Solutions', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Source', 'Spain', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Spottings', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Support of Research', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Transfection', 'Tubulin', 'Vesicle', 'Visual', 'Wolves', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'basal insulin', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'cell cortex', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'concept', 'day', 'density', 'design', 'desire', 'extracellular', 'flotillin', 'fluorescence imaging', 'fluorescence microscope', 'fluorophore', 'handbook', 'human wyatt protein', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'insulin signaling', 'interest', 'lens', 'medical schools', 'micromanipulator', 'migration', 'millisecond', 'mouse wyatt protein', 'nanometer', 'novel', 'object shape', 'photoactivation', 'prototype', 'radius bone structure', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'scaffold', 'simulation', 'single molecule', 'success', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'trans-Golgi Network', 'trend', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",OD,YALE UNIVERSITY,DP2,2007,2481250,550947887,-0.010958463099517483

"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.  Therefore, application of these algorithms is also likely to lead to eventual improvements in neural prosthetics for motor control and action.       n/a",Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems,7125904,R01MH066990,"['bioinformatics', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'information system analysis', 'mathematical model', 'model design /development', 'neural information processing', 'neurophysiology', 'sensory feedback', 'sensory mechanism', 'statistics /biometry']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2006,36891,148186688,0.034468563244185485
"High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Understanding normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and neonates is a key factor in early detection of developmental disorders. This project proposal seeks to develop and refine novel magnetic resonance image reconstruction and analysis methodology to allow, for the first time, the mapping of in-utero fetal brain development. One of the most common abnormalities detected by clinical imaging of the developing fetal brain is ventriculomegaly, which, despite the absence of other clinical or imaging findings, is associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities in infancy and childhood in up to 50% of cases. Although ultrasound allows diagnosis of the condition, it has not been able to distinguish those fetus that will have poor neurological outcome from those with normal outcome. Recent developments in fast magnetic resonance imaging have permitted the use of MRI to study the fetal anatomy and this technique is now being routinely used at a small number of sites around the world including UCSF. However, MR imaging of the fetal brain is still challenging because of imaging distortions caused by motion of the fetus within the mother and by artifacts caused by the surrounding maternal anatomy. Higher resolution or 3D acquisitions are not possible because of motion of the fetus during the acquisition time^ required. The current clinical 2D slice data individually provide limited resolution and contrast and, most importantly, often contain severe motion corruption between slices. This project is motivated by the observation that it is possible to apply computer vision and image processing techniques to correct relative motion between the multiple stacks of low resolution fetal slices, and create a single volumetric image with high isotropic 3D resolution and consistent geometry. Such higher resolution images provide structure that may be analyzed using computational morphometric techniques that can detect subtle focal differences in the pattern of tissue volume, location and surface folding. This project will combine such powerful techniques with extensive fetal and neonatal imaging experience at UCSF, allowing direct clinical application of the methodology to study morphologic aberrations associated with ventriculomegaly and to correlate these with clinical outcome. The ability to apply these computational techniques to in-utero data will provide an entirely new view of the developing brain, which promises to shed new light on early developmental problems both in fetuses and premature neonates.           n/a",High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI,7148587,R01NS055064,"['brain', 'clinical research', 'embryo /fetus']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO,R01,2006,274794,0,0.011660497126875155
"A Non-invasive Single-trial In-vivo Neuroimaging System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The overall goal of this project is to develop an integrated single-trial system for neuroimaging which combines high-density electroencephalography (EEG) with simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and to use this system to investigate variability in neural processing. The high-temporal resolution of EEG will enable the detection of signal variability in single-trial events, and this information will be used as the input function for analysis of simultaneously acquired event-related fMRI (efMRl). We hypothesize that using single-trial EEG derived regressors for efMRI (stEEG/fMRI) will yield high spatial and high temporal resolution information about the functional neuroanatomy involved in cognitive processing. This will enable construction of unique EEG derived tMRI activation maps which are not based on pre-defined labels or observed behavioral responses but rather on task and subject specific electrophysiological source variability. The broad impact of this work will be development of a new non-invasive imaging system (stEEG/fMRI) for the cognitive neurosciences as well as a clinical tool for diagnosis and monitoring of a broad spectrum of neurological diseases. The R21 effort focuses on development of a high density (64 channels) EEG/fMRI integrated system for single-trial analysis, and characterization of possible differences between the EEG recorded in an MR environment and that recorded in a standard environment. The R33 will then demonstrate the use of stEEG/fMRI in a pilot study of cognitive aging. R21Aims: 1. Develop an in-magnet 64 channel EEG system for single-trial analysis of event-related potentials recorded concurrently with fMRI. 2. Assess the quality of EEG collected inside the MR scanner compared to that collected in a shielded EEG room, using a series of predefined protocols for characterizing the effects of the auditory and magnetic environments on EEG and ERP wave forms. 3.

"CRCNS: Machine Learning for Analysis of fMRI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compromised inhibitory control is a hallmark neuropsychological deficit underlying complex disorders and behaviors as drug addiction and aggression. Individuals with compromised mechanisms of control are difficult to identify unless they are subjected to challenging conditions directly. This is possibly due to the subtle ways in which poor inhibitory control is expressed in their baseline functioning, making classification and most importantly, prediction of future behavior, extremely challenging. We propose novel computational techniques to analyze brain-behavior relationships underlying mechanisms of inhibitory control, focusing on performing classification of hard-to-categorize groups of subjects based on brain activation response patterns to behavioral challenges of inhibitory control using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl). These classification methods are applied on two distinct datasets: one of substance dependent individuals and the other of individuals with a particular genotype conferring vulnerability to poor inhibitory control. We hypothesize that unique patterns of variability in brain function can assist in identification of brain mechanisms rooted in compromised inhibitory control. Such patterns will increase our understanding of brain connectivity and circuitry as we move iteratively between a-priori and exploratory means of describing circuits of inhibitory control. Machine Learning techniques have been shown to be successful in discovering optimal features and patterns in complex high dimensional datasets. The diversity of the underlying questions when studying inhibitory control and the subtlety of the effects that can be used for classification, motivate us to propose an integrated machine learning framework for the joint exploration of spatial, temporal and functional information for the analysis of fMRI signals, thus allowing the testing of hypotheses and development of applications that are not supported by traditional analysis methods. We hypothesize that: 1) A differential  spatial brain pattern will indicate a diagnosis of drug addiction and a membership in one or another level ol MAOA genotype. Spatial information from static 3D contrast maps will be input to PCA-based and Voxel-based methods, Adaboosting and Learning with Side information 2) A temporally accounted intrasubject pattern of response to the inhibitory control challenge conditions in the fMRI paradigms will reveal group membership in both data sets. Temporal fMRl information wilt be used for Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, etc. 3) A connectivity map corresponding to brain circuits functionally subserving inhibitory control wilt be revealed with indications of directionality of influence between brain regions by analyzing functional information with Dynamic Bayesian Networks, Dynamically Multi-Linked HMMs, etc. n/a",CRCNS: Machine Learning for Analysis of fMRI,7051239,R01DA020949,"['behavioral /social science research tag', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'clinical research', 'cocaine', 'computer data analysis', 'drug addiction', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging', 'genotype', 'human subject', 'neuropsychology', 'reinforcer', 'substance abuse related behavior']",NIDA,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2005,253116,77607041,0.01008696088036341

"Adult Optical Non-Invasive Brain Oxygenation Monitor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is a need for a non-invasive and continuous bedside monitor for brain oxygenation for adult human patients. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is an optically based technique that could meet such demand.  However, NIRS instruments have yet to achieve their initially expected potential of becoming routine clinical monitors complementary to pulse oximetry. One major challenge is to develop an optical transducer probe and a corresponding algorithm to solve the problem of interference from extracerebral tissue (skin, scalp, and skull) in adult NIRS applications. Another major challenge is to develop an algorithm that will be able to absolutely quantify the optical signals to derive quantitative variables or indices that are of clinical significance. Our goal is to resolve these challenges to develop an NIRS monitor that will determine absolute brain hemoglobin oxygen saturation on adult patients.  The primary objectives of this SBIR proposal are: 1) Design and construct an NIRS monitor for use on adult human patients; 2) Determine the optimum adult NIRS probe configuration to minimize extracerebral interference 3) Evaluate and validate novel adult NIRS algorithms that further minimize extracerebral interference and determine absolute brain oxygen saturation.         n/a",Adult Optical Non-Invasive Brain Oxygenation Monitor,6585412,R43NS045488,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical equipment development', ' brain circulation', ' infrared spectrometry', ' noninvasive diagnosis', ' optics', ' oxygen transport', ' patient monitoring device', ' respiratory oxygenation', ' swine']",NINDS,"CAS MEDICAL SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2003,100000,0,0.007698883236395802
