"Phenotype screens of Chlamydia Inclusions Abstract Chlamydia trachomatis is a major health concern with over 200 million people with active urogenital or ocular infection each year worldwide. Chlamydia are obligate intracellular bacteria with a unique biphasic developmental cycle. A better understanding of that biphasic cycle can lead to inhibitors that are specific for chlamydial infection in order to avoid overuse of antibiotics. Individual Chlamydia are too small and tightly packed to be spatially separated with conventional light microscopes, and 3D SEM is too labor-intensive for inhibitor studies. We will use a new sample preparation method that physically expands the sample with polymers termed ""Expansion Microscopy"" or ExM. Expanded samples can then be imaged with a traditional confocal microscope, and high-content analysis performed automatically using machine learning methods such as pixel classification and novelty detection. Prepared samples can be imaged and analyzed in under an hour instead of the multiple days required for 3D SEM. This R03 grant will develop an innovative high-content screening platform, called Expansion Microscopy Aided Phenotyping (ExMAP), for the quantification of changes in Chlamydia development after treatment. ExMAP can be paired with Chlamydia transformed with promoters for EUO and IhtA (RB cell types) and the promoters for HctB and Tarp (EB cell types). The combination of expansion microscopy, machine learning, and chlamydial transformation will make ExMAP a powerful tool for research on both the developmental cycle and new therapy development. Project Narrative This project will develop a new high-content platform, termed ExMAP, that will physically expand the sample of interest and then utilize machine learning for image analysis. At the completion of the project, we expect to have developed a new method for the study of the Chlamydia developmental cycle and inhibitors that disrupt that cycle.",Phenotype screens of Chlamydia Inclusions,10128374,R03AI146437,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acrylates', 'Aftercare', 'Agonist', 'Antibiotics', 'Applications Grants', 'Bacteria', 'Cells', 'Chlamydia', 'Chlamydia Infections', 'Chlamydia genome', 'Chlamydia trachomatis', 'Chloramphenicol', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Screening', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Eye Infections', 'Gel', 'Genitourinary System Infection', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Iron Chelating Agents', 'Lead', 'Light Microscope', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'PF4 Gene', 'Penicillins', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Polymers', 'Preparation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'SIRT1 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sodium', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'cell type', 'chlamydia vaccine', 'human pathogen', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'promoter', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIAID,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY,R03,2021,77243,2966077
"Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge Candidate: With my multidisciplinary background in Artificial Intelligence (PhD), Public Health Informatics (MS), Epidemiology and Health Statistics (MS), and Preventive Medicine (Bachelor of Medicine), my career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Biomedicine, with a particular emphasis initially in machine learning and public health. Training plan: My K99/R00 training plan emphasizes machine learning, deep learning and scientific communication skills (presentation, writing articles, and grant applications), which will complement my current strengths in artificial intelligence, statistics, medicine and public health. I have a very strong mentoring team. My mentors, Drs. Michael Becich (primary), Gregory Cooper, Heng Huang, and Michael Wagner, all of whom are experienced with research and professional career development. Research plan: The research goal of my proposed K99/R00 grant is to increase the re-use of computable biomedical knowledge, which is knowledge represented in computer-interpretable formalisms such as Bayesian networks and neural networks. I refer to such representations as models. Although models can be re-used in toto in another setting, there may be loss of performance or, even more problematically, fundamental mismatches between the data required by the model and the data available in the new setting making their re-use impossible. The field of transfer learning develops algorithms for transferring knowledge from one setting to another. Transfer learning, a sub-area of machine learning, explicitly distinguishes between a source setting, which has the model that we would like to re-use, and a target setting, which has data insufficient for deriving a model from data and therefore needs to re-use a model from a source setting. I propose to develop and evaluate several Bayesian Network Transfer Learning (BN- TL) algorithms and a Convolutional Neural Network Transfer Learning algorithm. My specific research aims are to: (1) further develop and evaluate BN-TL for sharing computable knowledge across healthcare settings; (2) develop and evaluate BN-TL for updating computable knowledge over time; and (3) develop and evaluate a deep transfer learning algorithm that combines knowledge in heterogeneous scenarios. I will do this research on models that are used to automatically detect cases of infectious disease such as influenza. Impact: The proposed research takes advantage of large datasets that I previously developed; therefore I expect to quickly have results with immediate implications for how case detection models are shared from a region that is initially experiencing an epidemic to another location that wishes to have optimal case-detection capability as early as possible. More generally, it will bring insight into machine learning enhanced biomedical knowledge sharing and updating. This training grant will prepare me to work independently and lead efforts to develop computational solutions to meet biomedical needs in future R01 projects. Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge Narrative Re-using computable biomedical knowledge in the form of a mathematical model in a new setting is challenging because the new setting may not have data needed as inputs to the model. This project will develop and evaluate transfer learning algorithms, which are computer programs that adapt a model to a new setting by removing and adding local variables to it. The developed methods for re-using models are expected to benefit the public’s health by: (1) improving case detection during epidemics by enabling re-use of automatic case detectors developed in the earliest affected regions with other regions, and, more generally, (2) increasing the impact of NIH’s investment in machine learning by enabling machine-learned models to be used in more institutions and locations.",Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge,10158538,K99LM013383,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Big Data', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Influenza', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Parainfluenza', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'computer program', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'detector', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'skills', 'statistics', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K99,2021,93342,570146095
"A Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support Tool to Predict Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Prognosis Using Existing Longitudinal Data SUMMARY: A Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support Tool to Predict AAA Prognosis  Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a localized dilatation of the aorta. If left untreated AAA may go on to rupture, an occurrence which has a 90% mortality rate and is the 13th leading cause of death in the United States, with more than 15,000 annual deaths reported annually. After AAA is diagnosed, a clinician must determine its severity; i.e., the relative risk of rupture compared to the risk of intervention. Current clinical guidelines for this determination is based on the one-size-fits-all “maximum diameter criterion”, which states that when a AAA reaches 5.5 cm in diameter, the risk of rupture necessitates repair of the aneurysm. However, smaller sized AAAs (< 5.5 cm) have been seen to rupture at rates of up to 23.4%, demonstrating that this diameter-based criterion is unsuitable for AAA management. A recently completed NIH-funded clinical trial, 1U01-AG037120: “Non-Invasive Treatment of AAA Clinical Trial” (N-TA3CT) was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of pharmacologic treatment of small AAA. During this trial, a highly unique and valuable dataset was collected longitudinally every 6 months for a 3-year period for patients presenting with small AAA.  This proposal is designed to test the hypothesis that, at the time of discovery of small AAA, clinical prognosis – i.e., predicting if and when clinical intervention will be required based on rupture risk metrics – can be facilitated using machine learning-based algorithms using real-time biomechanical, morphological, and clinical data. To address this hypothesis, we will pursue two specific aims.  Aim 1 will be to quantify the “evolution” of individual small AAA from the N-TA3CT trial. The biomechanical and morphological status of all patient AAAs at each timepoint will be determined from data collected during the trial using finite element analysis and morphometric analysis, respectively, and these will be tabulated along with clinical indices for each AAA at each timepoint.  Aim 2 will be to develop and validate machine learning and regression techniques to forecast the clinical prognosis of small AAA. The data from Aim 1 as well as follow-up reporting data from the N- TA3CT trial will be used to train machine learning classification models to determine whether aneurysm prognosis can be accurately predicted. Validation will be performed on a subset of data to assess the accuracy, sensitivity, precision and specificity of the proposed prediction model.  The unique dataset from the N-TA3CT trial, paired with the extensive experience of and methods developed by our lab, will allow us, for the first time, to carefully examine and quantify the natural evolution of small AAA and to subsequently develop a predictive model to improve patient prognosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, when clinicians must decide if or when to fix an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA; characterized by the ballooning of a thin and weakened wall), they base their decision solely on the AAA diameter. However, a quarter of AAA below the accepted cutoff diameter still rupture, often leading to death. In this project, we will use a unique database collected during a clinical trial of small AAA, computer models, and machine learning to create a new decision method that will better serve patients with this disease.",A Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support Tool to Predict Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Prognosis Using Existing Longitudinal Data,10115365,R21HL156246,"['Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Aneurysm', 'Annual Reports', 'Aorta', 'Biomechanics', 'Caliber', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilatation - action', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'follow-up', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'rate of change', 'repaired', 'screening', 'serial imaging', 'support tools', 'theories', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2021,117375,570146095
"Digital Phenotyping of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease 1  2 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  3  4 One of the most critical gaps in management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the lack of effective  5 methods of early identification in the population. The objective of this study is to leverage data and analytics to  6 improve healthcare outcomes by early detection and risk stratification of NAFLD, before onset of liver-related  7 complications. Artificial intelligence applications in large electronic health records have the potential to identify  8 disease traits before onset of disease. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that targeted screening with  9 machine-learning models applied to large integrated healthcare datasets can identify individuals with NAFLD 10 and, more specifically, those with a progressive phenotype. We will test the central hypothesis in 2 specific 11 AIMs. First, we will train a machine learning model of NAFLD prediction using multiple longitudinal data points 12 of all health-care encounters of a well-characterized population-based cohort of individuals diagnosed with 13 NAFLD in reference to individuals without NAFLD from the general population. We hypothesize that 14 unsupervised machine learning can identify complex processes and patterns without a human's guidance and 15 discover early comorbidity clusters (“latent traits” present prior to NAFLD development) that reflect a phenotype 16 at risk to develop NAFLD later in life. Second, we will test and optimize the model for the prediction of patient 17 outcomes (development of cirrhosis, liver-related complications and death) in the NAFLD cohort. We 18 hypothesize that machine learning approaches could be used to further stratify patients into subgroups with 19 different disease trajectories, with the goal of identifying those individuals at risk of progressive NAFLD and 20 liver-related outcomes. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it expands the 21 analytical toolbox beyond conventional methods to identify individuals with NAFLD using all health-encounters 22 of a large, well-characterized population-based cohort with long follow-up. This proposal is significant because 23 it addresses a critical need of identification and management of the most prevalent chronic liver disease and 24 offers a practical solution to large scale implementation of screening and risk-stratification strategies using 25 routinely collected data. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to improve the population health in obesity- 26 associated diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will use innovative statistical methodology to improve the understanding of factors that predict an individual’s risk to develop nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and liver-related complications using routinely collected data available during the health care course of an individual. The development of effective and accessible tools to predict the risk of future development of liver disease will enable timely intervention to prevent the disease and reduce the burden of illness and mortality associated with obesity. Hence, the proposed research is critically important and relevant to the public health in a disease which affects a quarter of the adult population in the United States.",Digital Phenotyping of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease,10188162,R03DK128127,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Cirrhosis', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Decision Modeling', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'care outcomes', 'chronic liver disease', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'digital', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'health data', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'liver development', 'liver transplantation', 'mortality', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'population based', 'population health', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait', 'unsupervised learning']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R03,2021,119250,276703803
"CounterAct Administrative Supplement to NS114020 Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy Acute intoxication with organophosphorus (OP) pesticides is a significant public health concern and long-term neurological effects are not well understood. A major obstacle to progress towards reproducible, rigorous preclinical research in the long-term effects of OP- induced status epilepticus is that current experimental approaches often require prohibitively time and labor-intensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring and inherently subjective scoring of seizures by human observers (like the widely used Racine scale). While algorithms for automated seizure detection in EEG are improving, the critically important behavioral manifestations of acquired epilepsy and assessment of its cognitive comorbidities remain poorly quantified. Our parent grant focuses on developing an objective, high-throughput technique to characterize epileptic phenotypes using a new method called motion sequencing (MoSeq) and apply it to automated anti-epileptic drugs (AED) screening. The central idea of MoSeq rests on the discovery that complex animal behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules (“syllables”) at sub-second timescales that are arranged according to specific rules (“grammar”) that can be detected without observer bias by artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted 3D video analysis. In this administrative supplement project, we propose to employ and refine MoSeq to address key challenges in research into the development of new medical countermeasures (MCM) against nerve agents and OP pesticides. This includes testing if it is possible to objectively study the long-term effects of OP intoxication and evaluate MCMs at scale by determine epilepsy-specific behavioral modules and associated transition probabilities in mice after acute OP exposure. In addition, given that neuroinflammation is likely to play a key role in OP-induced persistent neuronal circuit disturbance, we will test if microglial depletion can rescue the OP-induced chronic changes in behavioral syllables and transition probabilities. Together, the aims in this administrative supplement will both benefit from and contribute to our parent grant’s goal to develop a reliable, sharable tool for the research community to study seizures and cognitive comorbidities of epilepsy. There is an urgent need for medical countermeasures (MCMs) against nerve agents and organophosphorus (OP) pesticides. The project will leverage from our recent technical breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of mouse behavior to test if it is possible to objectively study the long-term effects of OP intoxication and evaluate MCMs at scale. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to have a significant and sustained impact on preclinical research by enabling objective, automated, inexpensive, reproducible assessment of epileptic phenotypes in experimental animals after acute OP intoxication to aid the testing of anti-seizure drugs and other novel therapies.",CounterAct Administrative Supplement to NS114020 Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy,10227611,R01NS114020,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cannabidiol', 'Chronic', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Screening', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intoxication', 'Isoflurophate', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Neurologic Effect', 'Observer Variation', 'Pesticides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Status Epilepticus', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'acquired epilepsy', 'automated algorithm', 'comorbidity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical countermeasure', 'nerve agent', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel therapeutics', 'parent grant', 'pre-clinical research', 'screening', 'tool', 'valproate']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,123798,560644462
"The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health Abstract My research in health economics has focused on how information and targeted consumer cost-sharing influences how patients choose providers and the financial savings of incentivizing patients to choose low-price providers. I have also examined the opposite side of the market, how patient use of information and targeted consumer incentives spurs provider price competition. These topics provided the framework for my research as a PhD student in Health Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and I continue to build on these topics while a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation. A natural next step for my career is to expand this line of research but in a more in-depth manner and using more advanced statistical methods. Performing mentored research in these areas will help me successfully make the transition from directed to independent research. The proposed study will help me to (1) contribute to a deeper understanding of patient health effects of an innovative insurance benefit design that is particularly relevant for the aging population; (2) continue to build capabilities working with large medical claims data sets and develop expertise in innovative statistical methods from different disciplines; (3) gain training in aging-related health-services research; (4) expand my exposure to the aging, health economics, and health services research communities; and (5) develop my abilities as an independent health services researcher and build the foundations to successfully compete for R01-level grants.  In this project, I propose to examine whether reference pricing for colonoscopies and pharmaceuticals decreases adherence to recommended colorectal cancer screening and medication therapies among the near- elderly population. I will also examine the impact of reference pricing on patient health outcomes and the aging process. To do so, I intend to apply novel machine-learning statistical methods that have been recently developed in the computer science and statistics fields. As part of this proposal, I have built a formal training plan to develop expertise in these methods. This project will provide me with the flexibility and support to develop a long-term research agenda that focuses on using innovative statistical methods to evaluate the comprehensive effects of consumer cost- sharing programs. Although this study focuses on a single cost- sharing program, reference pricing, the skills I gain through this award will allow me to independently lead evaluations of future benefit designs. The application of machine-learning methods to the setting of reference pricing will provide a framework that I or other researchers can use to evaluate other insurance benefit designs or alternative patient populations. ! Narrative An increasingly popular insurance benefit design, reference pricing, provides targeted financial incentives for consumers to receive care at low-cost providers. While the financial savings from reference pricing programs are well-known, the health impacts have yet to be studied. The proposed career grant will apply machine learning techniques to develop a long-term research agenda focused on understanding the patient health effects of reference pricing for colonoscopies and medication therapies, which are services that are especially relevant for the aging population. !",The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health,10188375,K01AG061274,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Colonoscopy', 'Communities', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data Set', 'Deductibles', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Elderly', 'Employee', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Rate', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Benefits', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Internal Medicine', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Preventive service', 'Price', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Retirement', 'Savings', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Side', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aging population', 'asthmatic patient', 'career', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'comorbidity', 'compliance behavior', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'financial incentive', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'health economics', 'health plan', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'treatment effect']",NIA,RAND CORPORATION,K01,2021,129913,37281765
"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,10135919,K01DK114383,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Birth Certificates', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data repository', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'excessive weight gain', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant obesity', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'obesity treatment', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'tool']",NIDDK,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K01,2021,139614,232986943
"Passive mobile sensing and machine learning for the detection of drinking episodes PROJECT SUMMARY  Ambulatory assessment (AA) techniques (e.g., ecological momentary assessment, daily diaries, experiencing sampling) have provided critical tests of theories about the development of alcohol use disorder (AUD) by identifying within-person processes (such as negative or reinforcement, stress exposure, or social context) that can raise the risk for problem drinking and in turn AUD. AA methods are the leading methodological approach in the push towards personalized medicine because it provides a compelling platform for assessment, diagnosis, real-time monitoring, and just-in-time interventions. However, the current utility of AA for personalized models of AUD risk is limited because risky drinking and the risk factors for it (such as changes in moods, stress, or social contexts) change at different scales of time. In other words, even heavy drinkers may only drink a few times a week, but their emotions, stressors and social contexts change multiple times a day. Current AA methods that rely on self-report data have to sample frequently enough to be sensitive to change, long enough to observe sufficient drinking episodes, and to do so while avoiding participant burnout. Passive mobile sensing, which uses sensors (such as GPS, accelerometer, light meter, etc.) available on most smartphones, has been shown in preliminary studies to predict the probability of drinking episodes, but those studies have used relatively small samples. The present career development award aims to develop the candidate’s expertise in passive mobile sensing and the machine learning methods used to analyze passive mobile sensing data. The research proposal will analyze passive mobile sensing data collected in a large sample of regular drinking and marijuana using young adults (age 18 – 22, n = 500; 95.2% who drink), who will be followed using AA over 8 successive weekends as part of a parent R01 (DA 047247). The research goal is to identify passive mobile sensing models of risk factors for drinking (stress, social contexts, sleep, mood, and impulsive states), as well as the drinking episodes themselves.

"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs. The proposed novel approaches are expected to advance precision medicine approaches to SUDs by enabling treatment matching and a more refined SUD classification to gene finding.",Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data,10087504,K02DA043063,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurobiology', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol use disorder', 'biomarker performance', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cocaine use', 'contingency management', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'genetic association', 'genomic data', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'opioid use disorder', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'social', 'substance use treatment', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,K02,2021,158923,36067938
"Sarcopenia: computable phenotypes and clinical outcomes. PROJECT SUMMARY  Sarcopenia is a generalized muscle condition that develops with aging and complicates many common chronic diseases, resulting in low muscle mass, weakness, and impaired physical function. Sarcopenia contributes to disability, increased hospitalizations, healthcare costs, and risk of death. Despite being under- recognized clinically, sarcopenia is a major public health concern, with the worldwide prevalence projected to increase by up to 72% in the next 30 years. However, limited knowledge of sarcopenia among clinicians, combined with time pressures in clinical encounters delay its detection, and limit opportunity for intervention or recruitment into clinical trials. To overcome this barrier to detecting sarcopenia, we propose to use advanced big data and machine learning methods to identify additional component variables predicting sarcopenia among the rich electronic health record (EHR) data and develop a validated and portable sarcopenia computable phenotype (which uses a computer algorithm to detect patient characteristics or outcomes from the EHR). This innovative proposal takes advantage of key resources at Indiana University and its affiliation with the Regenstrief Institute and the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC), a statewide multi-health system clinical data warehouse including >100 healthcare entities and >18 million unique patients with both coded and text-based data, combined with the ability to perform comprehensive musculoskeletal measurements in the Musculoskeletal Function Imaging and Tissue (MSK-FIT) Core funded through a NIAMS Core Center for Clinical Research grant (P30AR072581). Our long-term goal is to accurately identify patients with, or at risk for, sarcopenia and its consequences in order to provide targeted interventions. We hypothesize that by using medical informatics and machine learning innovations, computable phenotypes can identify patients with sarcopenia from the EHR, predict deficits in measured muscle strength and physical function, and prospectively predict risk of hospitalization and death. In Aim 1, we will categorize >2000 adult participants in the MSK-FIT Core with accessible EHR data, as either sarcopenic or nonsarcopenic according to measurements of muscle strength, muscle mass and physical performance. We will then use 75% of the MSK- FIT Core cohort to train machine deep learning algorithms to detect combinations of variables from these subjects’ EHR predicting whether the patient is sarcopenic or not sarcopenic. The performance of the resulting computable phenotype will then be tested in the remaining 25% of the MSK-FIT Core participants. In Aim 2, we will test the performance of the sarcopenia computable phenotype to detect a clinically meaningful phenotype in the entire INPC adult population (>18 million), by evaluating the ability to predict the rate of hospitalizations and death among patients rated as sarcopenic versus matched controls. Such a computable phenotype will then enable large scale targeted recruitment, pragmatic clinical trials, clinical evaluation and intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sarcopenia is a generalized muscle condition that develops with aging and complicates many common chronic diseases, resulting in low muscle mass, weakness, and impaired physical function, and contributing to disability, increased hospitalizations and risk of death.

"Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm PROJECT SUMMARY The development of large observational health databases (OHD) has expanded the data available for analysis by pharmacoepidemiology research. The efficiency of these studies may be improved by simultaneously studying the association of multiple medications with a disease of interest. Unfortunately, prior research has demonstrated that it is difficult to distinguish true-positive from false-positive results when studying multiple exposures simultaneously, thus limiting the conclusions drawn from these types of studies and representing a major gap in the field. The objective of this proposal, which is the first step in achieving the applicant's long- term goal of improving the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases using insights derived from OHD, is to evaluate and validate medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA), a novel set-based signal-to- noise enrichment algorithm developed by the applicant to analyze multiple exposures from OHD with high sensitivity and specificity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that MCEA has equal sensitivity and greater specificity compared to logistic regression, the most widely used analytic method for OHD, for identifying true associations between medications and clinical outcomes. The applicant will complete the following two interrelated specific aims to test the hypothesis: Aim 1 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA) and logistic regression (LR) for identifying medication associations with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and Aim 2 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of MCEA and LR for identifying medication associations with gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GIH). The rationale for these aims is that by reproducing known medication-disease associations without false positives, MCEA can be used to identify novel pharmacologic associations with gastrointestinal diseases in future studies. The expected outcome for the proposed research is that it will demonstrate MCEA as a valid method for pharmacoepidemiology research, opening new research opportunities for the study of multi-exposure OHD. These new research opportunities may lead to more rapid identification of potential pharmacologic causes of emerging diseases and discovery of unanticipated beneficial medication effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications. To attain the expected outcome, the applicant will complete additional coursework that builds on his Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology to learn computational biology, machine learning, and econometrics techniques. With the support of this grant and his institution, he will also directly apply these techniques to pharmacoepidemiology applications under the close mentorship of a carefully selected team of faculty with extensive experience in gastroenterology, pharmacoepidemiology, medical informatics, and mentoring prior K-award grant recipients. Through these activities, the applicant will develop the skills necessary to obtain NIH R01-level funding and become a leader in developing novel techniques for application to the epidemiologic study of gastrointestinal diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traditionally, research studying medications associated with diseases are limited to analyzing one medication at a time. This novel proposal will validate medication class enrichment analysis, a recently developed algorithm to study multiple medications simultaneously for association with a disease of interest. Validation of this method will allow researchers to use existing medical databases to more rapidly identify potential medication causes of emerging diseases and identify medications with unanticipated beneficial effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications.",Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm,10128442,K08DK119475,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Aminoglycosides', 'Antibiotics', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Carbapenems', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cephalosporins', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Outcome', 'Penicillins', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'career development', 'clinical epidemiology', 'econometrics', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'research study', 'simulation', 'skills', 'usability']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2021,167900,593605914
"Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases Project Summary Patients living with chronic lung diseases (CLDs) are frequently admitted to the hospital for potentially preventable causes. Such admissions may be discordant with patient preferences and/or represent a low-value allocation of health system resources. To anticipate such admissions, existing clinical prediction models in this field typically produce an “all-cause” risk estimate which, even if accurate, overlooks the actionable mechanisms behind  admission risk and therefore fails to identify a prescribed response. This limitation may explain the only modest – at best – reductions in hospital admissions and readmissions seen in most intervention bundles that have been tested in this population. An opportunity exists, therefore, to predict hospitalization risk while simultaneously identifying patient phenotypes (i.e. some constellation of social, demographic, clinical, and other characteristics) for which known preventive interventions exist. The proposed study seeks to overcome these limitations and capitalize on this opportunity by (1) conducting semi-structured interviews with hospitalized patients with CLDs, and their caregivers and clinicians, to directly identify modifiable risks and their associated phenotypes driving hospital  admissions; (2) using natural language processing techniques (NLP) to build classification models that will leverage nuanced narrative, social, and clinical information in the unstructured text of clinical encounter notes to identify patients with these phenotypes; and (3) building risk prediction model focused on actionable phenotypes with a wide-array of traditional regression and machine learning approaches while also incorporating large numbers of predictor variables from text data and accounting for time-varying trends. The candidate's preliminary work using basic NLP techniques to significantly improve the discrimination of clinical prediction models in an inpatient population has motivated this methodologic approach. The rising burden and costs of hospitalizations associated with CLDs, and the increasing attention from federal payers, highlights the critical nature of this work. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters of Science in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. Based on the candidate's tailored training plan, he will acquire advanced skills in mixed-methods research, NLP, and trial design all through coursework, close  mentoring and supervision, and direct practice. The skills will position him ideally to submit successful R01s testing the deployment of the proposed clinical prediction models in real-world settings. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a  supportive environment for him to develop an independent research career testing the real-world deployment of clinical prediction models to reduce low-value and preference-discordant care for patients with CLDs. Project Narrative Every year many people living with chronic lung diseases are admitted to the hospital despite the fact that some of these admissions may have been prevented with early identification and intervention prior to the hospitalization. Previous attempts at preventing such hospitalizations have been limited by their ability to both accurately identify those at risk, and because most risk models do not provide a reason for the likely admission. The proposed work draws directly on the experiences of patients with chronic lung diseases who are admitted to a hospital, and then uses cutting edge statistical and computer science techniques to use information in the electronic health record to accurately predict the risk and the likely reason for future hospital admissions.",Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases,10134412,K23HL141639,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Outpatients', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Research', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical center', 'clinical encounter', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'end of life', 'experience', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'model development', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'prevent', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'skills', 'social', 'statistical learning', 'structured data', 'supportive environment', 'trend', 'trial design', 'unstructured data']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2021,173801,593605914
"Identifying False HPV-Vaccine Information and Modeling Its Impact on Risk Perceptions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States, with over 30,000 new HPV-related-cancers are diagnosed annually. Although HPV vaccines have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 2006 and recommended for routine vaccination for school-age girls and boys, vaccination rates remain low. One reason that has contributed to low vaccination rates is incorrect “risk perceptions” around HPV vaccines such as the high perceived risks of adverse events or side effects from the HPV vaccine. Incorrect risk perceptions are often rooted in the false information about HPV vaccines that people are exposed to in their daily life, including social media. The impact of social media on health information is substantial. Negative social-media HPV-vaccine information has been found to have an association with low vaccination coverage. Given the negative consequences of false information, there is a need to develop a robust and scalable way to detect false HPV-vaccine information before it propagates and negatively impacts behavior. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to build a model to identify false HPV-vaccine information on Twitter, demonstrate its impact on individual risk perceptions and measure its underlying mechanisms on risk perception formation. We propose a novel approach to leverage machine learning, natural language processing, network analysis, crowdsourcing/expert data annotation, psycholinguistic analysis and statistical modeling to investigate the false HPV-vaccine information collectively (in terms of its detection and propagation patterns) and individually (in terms of its impact and underlying cognitive mechanisms). Our study will first build a computational model to detect false HPV-vaccine information on Twitter. By modeling the domain-specific HPV- vaccine related text content, information-veracity related linguistic features, individual and collective user behaviors, and dissemination patterns, our model will be able to detect false HPV-vaccine information before it gets verified and spreads widely. We will then investigate the impact of false HPV-vaccine information on risk perceptions around HPV vaccination operationalized by natural language processing methods and a developed HPV-vaccine Risk Lexicon. We will further conduct psycholinguistic analysis on the false HPV-vaccine information and use statistical modeling to uncover the underlying mechanism of risk perceptions. Our study will make a critical and timely contribution to identifying the false HPV-vaccine information and its impact, which has the potential to be applied to other health topics. This proposed project will also address the National Cancer Institute priorities in promoting HPV vaccines and combating misinformation in cancer prevention and control. PROJECT NARRATIVE The uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine remains low in part because of incorrect perceptions of vaccination risks, which has been linked to the spread of false HPV-vaccine information. The proposed study seeks to build a computational model to detect false HPV-vaccine information on social media (Twitter) and determine its impact on risk perceptions of the HPV vaccine. The findings will provide important contributions to understand the impact of false health information on HPV vaccination behavior and could be expanded to other health topics.",Identifying False HPV-Vaccine Information and Modeling Its Impact on Risk Perceptions,10114245,R21CA237483,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Control', 'Categories', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine', 'Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignant Neoplasm', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Human papilloma virus infection', 'Individual', 'Information Dissemination', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Misinformation', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Plant Roots', 'Politics', 'Property', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'School-Age Population', 'Semantics', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Text', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'adverse event risk', 'boys', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer prevention', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'girls', 'high risk', 'information model', 'information processing', 'multilevel analysis', 'news', 'novel strategies', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'recurrent neural network', 'response', 'risk perception', 'side effect', 'social media', 'theories', 'uptake', 'vaccine acceptance']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2021,174255,76545728
"Data Science Applications in Communication andSwallowing Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The emergence of electronic medical records, large data registries and readily accessible, protected servers have resulted in an explosion of digital information with potentially high clinical impact for improving patient management and outcomes. Big data warehouses that capture standardized information within the scope of clinical practices allow trained scientists to not only engage in traditional hypothesis testing, but to also uncover new hypotheses, refine existing theories and apply new discoveries to health assessments and interventions. Despite the accessibility and potential impact of these data platforms, clinician scientists have traditionally directed experiments that incorporate relatively small sample sizes and data from individual laboratories, and have not been trained in big data analytics or in engaging appropriate team scientists who work in this space, such as computer scientists, biostatisticians and engineers. The overarching goal of this proposal is to mentor early patient oriented communication and swallowing scientists in big data analytics and to mentor and involve early data science scholars in communication and swallowing research. The PI proposes four primary mentorship and research goals in this K24 renewal proposal: 1. Train a cadre of early stage communication and swallowing scientists in data science methods, including machine learning, by an expert, interdisciplinary, collaborative data science team, 2. Engage and introduce early career data scientists from fields of biostatistics, computer science and engineering to communication and swallowing sciences, and respective data sets, toward facilitating interdisciplinary data science teams and research productivity, 3. Apply novel data science methods to identify phenotypes of swallowing impairment and severity classifications in patient groups known to be at high risk for nutritional and health complications related to dysphagia, and 4. Develop a new area of research in machine learning applications toward improving reliability of physiologic swallowing assessment. The data science theme of the career development and research plan directly align with NIDCD's Strategic Plan for Data Science which lists as its mission: Storing, managing, standardizing and publishing the vast amounts of data produced by biomedical research. NIDCD recognizes that accessible, well-organized, secure and efficiently operated data resources are critical to modern scientific inquiry…and by maximizing the value of data generated through NIH-funded efforts, the pace of biomedical discoveries and medical breakthroughs for better health outcomes can be accelerated. PROJECT NARRATIVE The emergence of electronic health records exposes clinicians to massive amounts of information about the millions of patients who suffer from communication and swallowing disorders, yet most clinical scientists do not have the training or skill to apply meaning to the data toward improving patient care. The overarching mentorship goal of this proposal is to train early, patient-oriented communication and swallowing scientists in big data analyses, including computer machine learning approaches. The research project will uncover distinct patterns and severity of swallowing impairments in large groups of patients with high risk medical diagnoses, which will have high impact on patient care planning and identification of treatments that directly target these impairments for improved outcomes.",Data Science Applications in Communication andSwallowing Disorders,10073493,K24DC012801,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Barium swallow', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Explosion', 'Funding', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nutritional', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Science', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stroke', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'computerized', 'data registry', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'health assessment', 'high risk', 'human error', 'impression', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning algorithm', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'programs', 'research and development', 'skills', 'statistical learning', 'theories', 'uptake']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,K24,2021,183209,66720547
"Novel Glucose Responsive Insulin for Improved Treatment of Diabetes SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Diabetes is rapidly becoming a global health crisis. Depending on the type of statistical methodology used, the world-wide incidence of the most common type of diabetes, adult-onset or Type II, is estimated to be in the range of 285 million. In both Type I and Type II diabetics glycemic control is paramount as the inability to maintain glycemic control results in several secondary complications including neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy, that often lead to amputations, dialysis and blindness as well as increased risk of cardiovascular complications. For the majority of diabetics glycemic control requires constant vigilance and monitoring of blood glucose levels. The overarching goal of this project is the development of a novel glucose responsive insulin (GRI) with a reversible, glucose dependent response at the insulin receptor. The full realization of the GRI concept would most closely mimic the benefits of a healthy pancreas and maintain euglycemia, reduce/eliminate the need for constant monitoring, and ultimately, reduce/eliminate the complications of diabetes. The scope of this proposal is the design and testing of a series of analogs that can bind glucose allosterically and demonstrate differential response at the insulin receptor. This will be achieved through completion of three aims. In Aim 1 we will use a novel computational platform to design and produce a series of GRIs with glucose binding affinity in the physiological range. In Aim 2 we will determine the glucose binding affinity of the analogues produced in Aim 1. Finally, in Aim 3 we will measure the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin like growth factor (IGF-R1) affinity of the GRI’s in the presence of glucose at physiological concentrations. Completion of these Aims will result in the identification of several GRI lead candidates with glucose binding in the physiological range and reversible glucose dependent insulin receptor binding and absence of IGF-1R binding. NARRATIVE Diabetes is rapidly becoming a global health crisis. In both Type I and Type II diabetics glycemic control is paramount as the inability to maintain glycemic control results in a number of secondary complications including neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy, that often lead to amputations, dialysis and blindness. A reversible glucose responsive insulin (GRI) would represent a significant improvement in diabetes care for both T1D and T2D patients. The success of this project will result in clinical candidates that will ultimately supplant basal and prandial insulins while simultaneously improving glycemic control and reducing hypoglycemic incidences known to increase cardiovascular risk as well as secondary complications.",Novel Glucose Responsive Insulin for Improved Treatment of Diabetes,10250801,R43DK126521,"['Adult', 'Affinity', 'Amputation', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Blindness', 'Blood Glucose', 'Calorimetry', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Fructose', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypoglycemia', 'IGF1 gene', 'Incidence', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin Receptor', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Leucine', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Neuropathy', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Rapid screening', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Somatomedins', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Trees', 'Type 2 diabetic', 'Valine', 'Xylose', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'carbene', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical candidate', 'computational platform', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'diabetic', 'drug candidate', 'euglycemia', 'global health', 'glycemic control', 'healthy volunteer', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'insulin Wakayama', 'lead candidate', 'lead series', 'machine learning algorithm', 'milligram', 'novel', 'pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics', 'phase 2 study', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'standard of care', 'success', 'type I diabetic', 'vigilance', 'web server']",NIDDK,"AMIDEBIO, LLC",R43,2021,183955,816607
"Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury Project Summary Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is recognized as the leading cause of death and disability in all parts of the world and costs the international economy approximately US$400 billion annually, which, given an estimated standardized gross world product of US $73.7 trillion, is a striking 0.5% of the entire annual global output. To address the profound issues related to a drastic increase in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for TBI over the past decades, the United States Congress highlighted injury surveillance as a federal priority. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines surveillance as “use of health-related data that precede diagnosis and signal a sufficient probability of a case or an outbreak to warrant further public health response”. To prevent TBI, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns, in addition to having strong knowledge of clinical disorders, characteristic, or other definable entity, that differentiates TBI from other clinical populations. A critical barrier to the progress of the NIH-funded program “Comorbidity in traumatic brain injury and risk of all-cause mortality, functional and financial burden: a decade-long population based cohort study” was the presence of complex and multifaceted comorbidities in a patient with TBI before and at the time of the injury, and their links to patients’ frailty, injury circumstances, severity, and outcomes. This resulted in a shift in the research paradigm, and development of a novel data mining approach used in genomics to sequence more than 70,000 clinical diagnosis codes in a TBI population, and compare them to a matched population. The developed data mining approach allowed not only the validation of previously known risk factors of TBI, but also the identification of associations previously unknown, without any preconceived human biases. This project will continue advancement of a non-hypothesis driven scientific approach, which will: (1) Characterize patients with TBI at three different time periods in relation to the TBI event – before, at the time of, and after the injury; (2) Develop individual and population level models to study the transitions between the different time states; and (3) Construct and validate predictive models of susceptibility to TBI events, adverse outcomes, and high healthcare resource use at the individual and population level. Decades- long population-based health administrative data from the publicly-funded healthcare system in Ontario, Canada is ready to be further analysed for clinical and technological advancement, to support human thinking in categorizing personal, clinical, and environmental exposure data preceding TBI. Project Narrative To detect, manage, and prevent traumatic brain injury (TBI), a complex and often lifelong disabling injury, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns and have a comprehensive knowledge of the clinical disorder, characteristic, or other definable entity that differentiates between and within persons at risk of TBI of varying mechanisms, injury presentation, and its course. This research proposal expands an ongoing NIH-funded project that started to categorize clinical comorbidities and personal and environmental exposure data into clinically meaningful factors that increase the risk of injury and its severity at the population and individual levels. With the support of data mining and big data, this proposed program will advance research methods with a goal-directed learning process and the fields of injury surveillance and precision medicine, covering a variety of interests in public health, brain injury medicine, and behavioural and social sciences.",Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury,10223453,R01NS117921,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Ambulances', 'Americas', 'Amnesia', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Pathology', 'Canada', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Elements', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Hardship', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Injury', 'International', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Natural regeneration', 'Ontario', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Province', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Secondary to', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TBI Patients', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Unconscious State', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'assault', 'behavioral/social science', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disability', 'expectation', 'falls', 'frailty', 'functional outcomes', 'gender disparity', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'injury recovery', 'injury surveillance', 'interest', 'medically necessary care', 'men', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'survivorship', 'vehicular accident', 'virtual']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,R01,2021,188548,2238991
"Leveraging computational models of neurocognition to improve predictions about individual youths' risk for substance use disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This K23 proposal seeks to provide an early-career clinical psychologist and neuroscientist (Dr. Alexander Weigard) with the mentorship, training, and resources necessary to launch a career as an independent patient- oriented investigator focused on using advanced computational methods to elucidate etiological mechanisms of substance use disorders (SUDs) and generate meaningful predictions for patients. The candidate will work towards this long-term goal through the completion of a research project focused on assessing whether two advanced computational methods can facilitate the selection of features from neuroscientific data that are relevant for the individualized prediction of SUD risk in youth. Although extant research in developmental neuroscience has identified multiple early risk factors that are associated with development of SUD at the group level, there is currently a dearth of large scale, replicable research in which neurocognitive data are used to make reliable and generalizable predictions of SUD outcomes for individual youth. In the proposed project, the candidate will combine his existing expertise in computational models of cognition with new training in predictive informatics methods to assess whether two advanced computational approaches, a) sequential sampling models (SSMs) of cognition and b) network neuroscience, can be used to extract features from longitudinal neurocognitive data that enhance the prediction of youths’ SUD outcomes. The candidate will conduct extensive analyses with two large data sets (Michigan Longitudinal Study, Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study) and collect pilot data with 60 young adults to accomplish the following research aims: 1) Quantify the added benefit of SSM parameters for improving the performance of multivariate SUD prediction models, and 2) Identify the multivariate neural signature of v, an SSM parameter with promising links to substance use, and determine the potential of this signature for predicting a precursor to SUD (substance use initiation in mid-adolescence) in ABCD and differentiating young adults with SUDs in the newly-collected pilot sample. Completion of the following training objectives will ensure that the candidate can both carry out the proposed project and establish himself as an independent investigator who is well-equipped to conduct future projects following from this work: 1) Mastering principles of machine learning model development and testing in longitudinal data sets, 2) building expertise in using multivariate network neuroscience methods for feature selection and prediction, 3) increasing clinical and epidemiological knowledge of SUD risk factors beyond neurocognition, and 4) improving professional skills necessary to become an independent patient-oriented investigator. The proposed K23 aims to take a crucial step towards the development of advanced computational neuroscience methods that may ultimately inform SUD prevention efforts by identifying reliable predictors of individuals’ SUD risk, and to set the candidate up to independently conduct leading edge research in the interest of this larger goal. PROJECT NARRATIVE Decades of developmental neuroscience research have illuminated multiple factors that convey risk for the development of substance use disorders (SUDs) at the group level, but the field currently lacks methods for using neurocognitive data to make accurate and generalizable predictions about SUD risk for individual youth. The proposed project seeks to address this critical gap in the field by providing an early-career scientist with the tools and training necessary to test whether the combination of two advanced computational approaches, sequential sampling models of cognitive functioning and network neuroscience methods, improve the accuracy of multivariate predictive models of individuals’ SUD risk. Knowledge from this project could lead to the development of novel computational approaches that optimize the identification of predictive features in youths’ neurocognitive data, which may ultimately inform SUD prevention efforts.",Leveraging computational models of neurocognition to improve predictions about individual youths' risk for substance use disorders,10213907,K23DA051561,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psychologist', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scientist', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'adolescent substance use', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'computational neuroscience', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'early onset substance use', 'emerging adulthood', 'feature selection', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'learning network', 'longitudinal dataset', 'meetings', 'model development', 'neural patterning', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'young adult']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2021,196560,641965656
"A Dental implant registry of treatment outcomes of implant therapy by practitioners in the National Dental Practice Based Research Network There is a substantial body of literature to support that biological and prosthetic complications occur which may interfere with the health of the peri-implant tissues, the function and esthetics of the implant restoration. Peri-implant diseases are classified into peri-implant mucositis, inflammation restricted to the peri-implant mucosa, and peri-implantitis, characterized by peri-implant bone loss. The limitations of the current body of literature of biologic and prosthetic complications are based on many small studies and in large part conducted in an academic and specialty setting. We propose to create an implant registry within the National Dental Practice Based Research Network (NDPBRN) that will record the setting and implant therapy, the implants used, the prosthetic therapy provided and the rate of complications. The registry will create an opportunity for subsequent, additional targeted studies on specific complications available from the registry data and will lead to diagnosis driven therapy strategies. The target enrollment is a total of 2000 implants with prosthesis across the whole network. The one year UG3 Phase will be used to create a strategy to be able to meet the recruitment and enrollment objectives and to develop the protocol for data collection to facilitate the data gathering of the practitioners for the subjects they enroll. The data collection model we propose will be designed to be validated, concise, and easy to use for practitioners. We will develop a web based decision tree that will guide the practitioner through the data collection. The UH3 phase will recruit practitioners with representation of all 6 regions of the network that will enroll subjects with 2000 implants. Data collection will be detailed and comprehensive and will include surgical, prosthetic, and biologic aspects of implant therapy and radiographs for bone level assessments for a period of 3 years. The data will present clinically meaningful information about the prevalence of the various implant therapies, the incidence of prosthetic and biologic implant complications, risk factors for implant complications and evidence-based implant therapy strategies in every dental practices. We expect that the results from this study will significantly impact the clinical practice of implant dentistry and the quality of care provided for the patients. We propose to create an Implant Registry capturing implant therapy that is provided by practitioners within the NDPBRN. The aim is to determine the therapies associated with the greatest amount of success and the least amount of complications. With the data generated through this registry, we will add to the generalizable knowledge about implant therapy, the complications and therapies associated with implant success at the fixture level and the patient level.",A Dental implant registry of treatment outcomes of implant therapy by practitioners in the National Dental Practice Based Research Network,10101988,UG3DE030090,"['Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biometry', 'Budgets', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinical', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Dental General Practice', 'Dental Implants', 'Dentistry', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Esthetics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Mucositis', 'Mucous Membrane', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral health', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Private Practice', 'Prosthesis', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'data registry', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health related quality of life', 'medical specialties', 'peri-implant bone loss', 'peri-implantitis', 'personalized therapeutic', 'practice setting', 'practice-based research network', 'recruit', 'restoration', 'success', 'tool']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,UG3,2021,202410,325573502
"High Throughput Screen and High Information Follow-Up Tests for Genotoxicants Project Summary  Current batteries of genetic toxicology assays exhibit several critical deficiencies. First, the throughput capacity of in vitro genotoxicity tests is low, and does not meet current needs, especially for early, high volume screening environments that need to prioritize chemicals for further testing and/or development. Second, conventional assays provide simplistic binary calls, genotoxic or non-genotoxic. In this scheme there is little or no information provided about genotoxic mode of action. This is severely limiting, as it does not generate key information necessary for prioritizing chemicals for further testing, guiding subsequent assays’ endpoints/experimental designs, or conducting risk assessments. Finally, most current assays do not place requisite emphasis on dose response relationships, and therefore do not contextualize the results in terms of potency. These deficiencies prevent genotoxicity data from optimally contributing to modern risk assessments, where all of these capabilities and high information content are essential. We will solve these issues by developing, optimizing, and validating a two-tiered testing strategy based on multiplexed DNA damage responsive biomarkers and high-speed flow cytometric analysis. The first-tier focuses on throughput and is used to prioritize likely genotoxicants for more comprehensive analysis in second tier testing. Specifically, it involves a collection of several multiplexed biomarkers that will be used to identify likely genotoxic agents and provide a preliminary assessment of genotoxic mode of action. The gH2AX biomarker detects DNA double strand breaks, phospho-histone H3 identifies mitotic cells, nuclear p53 content reports on p53 activation in response to DNA damage, the frequency of 8n+ cells measure polyploidization, and the ratio of nuclei to microsphere counts provides information about treatment-related cytotoxicity. The second tier focuses on information content and considers many more concentrations as well as additional biomarkers, including micronucleus formation. Collectively, the tier two results provide definitive predictions about test chemicals’ genotoxic potential, mode of action, and potency. Over the course of this project we will study more than 3,000 diverse chemicals in order to understand the performance characteristics and generalizability of the two-tiered testing strategy. An interlaboratory trial will be conducted with prototype assay kits to assess the transferability of the methods, with the ultimate goal of providing the Nation with commercially available kits and testing services. Project Narrative Some chemicals in commercial use and in the environment can cause DNA damage and this damage can contribute to the development of cancer and other severe diseases. We will develop, optimize, and validate an improved testing strategy based on highly automated processes tracking several DNA damage biomarkers that can be analyzed without the need for animal testing. These methods will be configured into commercially available kits and testing services.",High Throughput Screen and High Information Follow-Up Tests for Genotoxicants,10255405,R44ES033138,"['Address', 'Animal Testing', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Buffers', 'Canada', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collection', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'End Point Assay', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Formulation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histone H3', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic Activation', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Miniaturization', 'Mitotic', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutagens', 'National Toxicology Program', 'Nuclear', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Reagent', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxicogenetics', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'cell type', 'climate change', 'computerized tools', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'genotoxicity', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'micronucleus', 'phosphatase inhibitor', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'screening', 'testing services']",NIEHS,"LITRON LABORATORIES, LTD.",R44,2021,204743,651293
"An Autonomous, Non-invasive, and Bioanalytics-enabled Wearable Platform for Precision Nutrition and Personalized Medicine Project Summary  This proposal aims to enable precision nutrition by creating a wearable technology that can be scaled across the general population to non-invasively track the diurnal profiles of a panel of putative circulating nutrients and biomarkers. Accordingly, we will address fundamental and intermeshed engineering bottlenecks and scientific questions at sensor, device, and data analytics levels to realize a sweat-based wearable bioanalytical technology, equipped with autonomous sweat secretion modulation, biofluid management, and analysis capabilities. To illustrate our technology’s transformative potential, we will particularly position it to monitor a panel of nutrients and indicators of the metabolic and disease state that are relevant in cystic fibrosis (CF, the most common inherited multisystemic disorder), in order to enable individualized nutritional support, which is central to the CF treatment.  Accordingly, in the first phase (R21), we will develop microsensor arrays targeting glucose, triglyceride, and β- hydroxybutyrate. We will incorporate our readily developed auxiliary sensing modalities (sweat sodium, chloride, pH, and sweat secretion rate sensing interfaces) to enable the in-situ characterization of the secretion profile (which is useful for the normalization of sweat readings and tracking of the CF progression). In parallel to these engineering efforts, we will conduct sweat characterization experiments to study the effect of the secretion rate on analyte partitioning from blood into sweat. These datasets will be augmented with state-of-art machine learning algorithms to formulate a dedicated analytical framework that accounts for sweat secretion variabilities and determines optimal sweat secretion condition(s) to provide undistorted and physiologically meaningful sweat readings.  In the second phase (R33), we will establish the clinical utility of our technology by demonstrating the ability to non-invasively track the target nutrients’ temporal profiles in relation to their circulating levels in blood (in both healthy subjects and CF patients and through simple/mixed meal-modulated studies). Accordingly, we will first measure the sweat and blood analytes’ excursion profiles after controlled single/binary combinations of nutrients intake and develop a machine-learning based algorithm to correlate the sweat analyte readouts to their circulating concentrations. Then we will assess and characterize the predictive utility of our solution in the context of complex nutritional supplement studies. Upon its validation, we will recruit a cohort of CF patients and perform a longitudinal randomized nutritional support study to demonstrate the enabling remote patient monitoring capabilities rendered by our solution.  The success of this work will represent a groundbreaking contribution towards the development of strategies to enable precision nutrition and personalized medicine. Project Narrative This proposal aims to enable precision nutrition by creating a wearable sweat bioanalytical technology— equipped with autonomous sweat secretion modulation, biofluid management, and analysis capabilities—that can be scaled across the general population to non-invasively track the diurnal profiles of a panel of putative circulating nutrients and biomarkers. By deploying this technology in clinical studies (with a particular focus on cystic fibrosis, the most common inherited multisystemic disorder), we will study and establish the correlation of the sweat readings to the circulating analytes and in response to nutritional interventions. This technology will provide a comprehensive and physiologically rich view of the individuals’ well-being/disease and nutritional status, rendering a personalized solution for effective treatment and nutritional support.","An Autonomous, Non-invasive, and Bioanalytics-enabled Wearable Platform for Precision Nutrition and Personalized Medicine",10198604,R21DK128711,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Engineering', 'General Population', 'Glucose', 'Health', 'Hour', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Inherited', 'Intake', 'Iontophoresis', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional Support', 'Nutritional status', 'Periodicity', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Randomized', 'Reading', 'Sampling', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Study Subject', 'Sweat Glands', 'Sweat test', 'System', 'Technology', 'Triglycerides', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'beta-Hydroxybutyrate', 'cofactor', 'cohort', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'dietary supplements', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microsensor', 'multidisciplinary', 'nutrition', 'operation', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'remote patient monitoring', 'response', 'sensor', 'success', 'targeted biomarker', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2021,210796,673201228
"Deep-learning-based prediction of AMD and its progression with GWAS and fundus image data Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Successful genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of AMD have identified many disease-susceptibility genes. Through great efforts from international GWAS consortium and large-scale collaborative projects, massive datasets including high-quality GWAS data and well-characterized clinical phenotypes are now available in public repositories such as dbGaP and UK Biobank. Clinically, color fundus images have been extensively used by ophthalmologists to diagnose AMD and its severity level. The combination of wealthy GWAS data and fundus image data provides an unprecedented opportunity for researchers to test new hypotheses that are beyond the objectives of original projects. Among them, predictive models for AMD development and its progression based on both GWAS and fundus image data have not been explored. Most existing prediction models only focus on classic statistical approaches, often regression models with a limited number of predictors (e.g., SNPs). Moreover, most predictions only give static risks rather than dynamic risk trajectories over time, of which the latter is more informative for a progressive disease like AMD. Recent advances of machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, have been proven to significantly improve prediction accuracy by incorporating multiple layers of hidden non-linear effects when large-scale training datasets with well-defined phenotypes are available. Despite its success in many areas, deep learning has not been fully explored in AMD and other eye diseases. Motivated by multiple large-scale studies of AMD development or progression, where GWAS and/or longitudinal fundus image data have been collected, we propose novel deep learning methods for predicting AMD status and its progression, and to identify subgroups with significant different risk profiles. Specially, in Aim 1, we will construct a novel local convolutional neural network to predict disease occurrence (AMD or not) and severity (e.g., mild AMD, intermediate AMD, late AMD) based on (1a): a large cohort of 35,000+ individuals with GWAS data and (1b): a smaller cohort of 4,000+ individuals with both GWAS and fundus image data. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel deep neural network survival model for predicting individual disease progression trajectory (e.g., time to late-AMD). In both aims, we will use the local linear approximation technique to identify important predictors that contribute to individual risk profile prediction and to identify subgroups with different risk profiles. In Aim 3, we will validate and calibrate our methods using independent cohorts and implement proposed methods into user-friendly software and easy-to-access web interface. With the very recent FDA approval for Beovu, a novel injection treatment for wet AMD (one type of late AMD) by inhibiting VEGF and thus suppressing the growth of abnormal blood vessels, it makes our study more significant, as it will provide most cutting-edge and comprehensive prediction models for AMD which have great potential to facilitate early diagnosis and tailored treatment and clinical management of the disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this proposal is to develop new analytic methods and software tools to facilitate novel prediction of AMD development and its progression. The successful completion of the project will generate the first comprehensive set of deep-learning-based prediction models and web-based interfaces, which jointly analyzes large-scale GWAS and fundus image data and has the great potential to enhance the early diagnosis and current clinical management of AMD.

"Photoplethysmography Analysis to Assess Cardio-Cerebrovascular Impact of Sleep Project Summary Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common in the aging population and is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease, including cerebrovascular injury. Repetitive exposure to acute CV response, such as sympathetic surge and blood pressure (BP) rise following obstructive respiratory events, is an important mediating mechanism linking OSA to CV disease and cerebrovascular injury. However, such acute CV responses are not effectively captured by conventional polysomnography metrics, such as the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) commonly used in OSA evaluation. This results in imprecise classification of patients in terms of their CV risk and may be responsible for inconsistent results in epidemiologic and clinical studies. More importantly, the uncertainty of the effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in reducing the CV risk poses a significant challenge in therapeutic decision-making in older individuals. Therefore, the identification of additional phenotypic markers that better quantify the unfavorable CV effects of OSA and provide improved prediction of CV outcomes is crucial to improving risk stratification and clinical therapeutic decision-making. Herein, we propose to study novel physiologic measurements that can readily be retrieved from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and investigate whether PPG features are associated with markers of subclinical, clinical CV disease, and cerebrovascular injury. We will extract PPG features from polysomnography obtained in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study and examine whether PPG features are associated with CV outcomes, including left ventricular mass, aortic stiffness, and incident cardiovascular events, as well as markers of cerebrovascular injury, including brain structural abnormalities by MRI and cognitive impairment by Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument in the older men and women. We will compare the association of PPG features with these outcomes with that of conventional OSA assessment metrics (such as apnea hypopnea index). The main PPG feature of interest is slope transit time. To assess the utility of the various PPG features for use in estimating and classifying outcomes, we will use novel machine learning methods, such as are based on the GNOSIS (Generalized Networks for the Optimal Synthesis of Information Systems) information-theory-based modeling tool. Subsequently, we will determine how PPG features predict BP treatment response to CPAP and O2 therapy using data from the HeartBEAT randomized controlled trial. This study attempts to identify novel PSG metrics that are cardiovascular-centric and to assess their clinical utility in the older adults. The findings of the study will provide a basis for further development of a simpler method by which to assess and monitor OSA. Considering the high prevalence of OSA in older populations, coupled with its impact on adverse health outcomes, the proposal has significant public health implications. Project Narrative Currently used conventional metrics for sleep apnea assessment has many limitations including insufficient consideration of acute cardiovascular response to sleep apnea event. We propose to study a novel physiologic measurements that can be readily retrieved from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and investigate whether they are associated with markers of subclinical, clinical CVD and neurocognitive outcomes. We will use data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study to evaluate PPG features in their associations with outcomes and examine whether these features help identify people who respond better to CPAP therapy in terms of blood pressure in the Heart Biomarker Evaluation in Apnea Treatment (HeartBEAT) randomized controlled trial data.",Photoplethysmography Analysis to Assess Cardio-Cerebrovascular Impact of Sleep,10266835,R21AG070576,"['Acute', 'Apnea', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Heart', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Information Theory', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Left Ventricular Mass', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Older Population', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Polysomnography', 'Public Health', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Structural defect', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'aging population', 'arm', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'older men', 'older women', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'predicting response', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'response', 'screening', 'sensor', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2021,273213,533302350
"Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID) PROJECT SUMMARY Small molecules are one of the most important classes of therapeutics alleviating suffering and in many cases death for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Small molecules also serve as invaluable tools to study biology, often with the goal to validate novel targets for the development of future therapeutic drugs. Reproducibility of experimental results and the interoperability and reusability of resulting datasets depend on accurate descriptions of associated research objects, and most critically on correct representations of small molecules that are tested in biological assays. For example, it is not possible to develop predictive models of protein target - small molecule interactions if their chemical structure representations are not correct. Many factors contribute to errors in reported chemical structures in small molecule screening and omics reference databases, scientific publications, and many other web-based resources and documents. Because of the complexity of representing small molecules chemical structure graphs and the lack of thorough curation, errors are frequently introduced by non-experts and error propagation across different digital research assets is a pervasive problem. To address this challenging problem via a scalable approach, we propose the Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID). AutoMID will be usable in batch mode at scale via an API, for example to assist chemical structure standardization and registration by maintainers of digital research assets, and also via interactive (UI) mode for everyday researchers to quickly and easily validate or correct their small molecule representations. AutoMID will leverage extensive highly standardized linked databases of chemical structures and associated information including names, synonyms, biological activity and physical properties and their sources / provenance and leverage expert rules and AI to enable reliable disambiguation of chemical structure identities at scale. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small molecules are one of the most important types of drugs. They also serve as invaluable tools to study biology.

"The Role of Impaired Physical Function during Midlife on Predicting future ADRD Project Summary To reduce the increasing societal and financial burden of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), prevention is critical. Even small improvements of the modifiable dementia risk factors on the individual level have the potential to lead to a substantial reduction of dementia cases at the population level. The disease processes occur for years though symptoms typically appear after age 60. Thus, identifying those at risk early for intervention is crucial. Studies among adults aged 60 years and older have identified performance-based measures of impairment in physical function as early indicators of ADRD, three or more years prior to onset. To improve earlier prediction of ADRD, we need research on adults aged 51-59 years to assess the relationship between physical functional impairment and likelihood of ADRD onset years later. Further, given the burden of administering performance-based measures of physical function, it would be advantageous to use patient- reported metrics of limitation in physical function for ADRD prediction. We propose using the 1998-2018 nationally representative Health and Retirement Study (HRS) of adults aged 51-59 years to determine the extent to which patient-reported measures of function would facilitate efficient ADRD risk identification. Primary study aims are to: 1) To identify the extent to which self-reported measures of physical function in midlife predict future late-onset ADRD. We will use standardized (RAND HRS) self-reported measures of function and the Langa-Weir ADRD algorithm available in the HRS. Working hypothesis: Limitations in physical function, defined using summary measures of self-reported physical function predict onset of ADRD 4 to 20 years later. 2) Verify that sub-groups of adults, defined by limitations in physical function, aged 51-59 are at higher risk of developing ADRD. We will verify existence of sub-groups (identified in our preliminary analyses) using a computational systems approach (cluster analysis) are predictive of onset of ADRD through 2018, in adjusted analyses. Working hypothesis: Sub-groups of middle-aged adults with unique patterns of limitations in physical function are at higher risk of developing ADRD than those without physical functional deficit 4 to 20 years later, independent of related factors. This proposal addresses the objectives of PAS-19-391 in several ways. First, the Principal investigator (PI), an early stage investigator, is committed to a career in ADRD research. Second, the investigative team has training in non-neurological medical fields and will shift their research focus to ADRD prevention within their fields. Third, the PI has experience with an existing dataset (HRS); and will use it to assess age-related changes in non-cognitive processes that may be early signs of ADRD. Finally, the PI published an HRS study reporting that physical functional decline precedes the onset of diabetes, a risk factor for ADRD. Our proposal builds on this work. The successful completion of the proposed study will ascertain the extent to which self-reported impairment in physical function during midlife, predicts future ADRD, thereby offering a new, efficient mechanism for early identification of ADRD. Project Narrative  The proposed research is relevant to public health because the number of people living with dementia is expected to triple worldwide by 2050 unless effective measures to treat or delay the onset of the disease are implemented.1 The same study found that about 35% of ADRD could be delayed or prevented through modifiable health and lifestyle factors from different phases of life. To identify adults at risk of ADRD early, our study among adults aged 51-59 seeks to determine the extent to which self-reported measures of physical function are early indicators of ADRD and to identify sub-groups of people with unique patterns of limitation in physical function that are early indicators of ADRD.",The Role of Impaired Physical Function during Midlife on Predicting future ADRD,10106121,R03AG070668,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Blood', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognition', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Financial Hardship', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Activity', 'Muscle', 'Nursing Homes', 'Observational Study', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive measure', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Subjects Selections', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'base', 'career', 'dementia risk', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'grasp', 'high risk', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'machine learning method', 'middle age', 'performance based measurement', 'prevent']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2021,287889,127562714
"Computational Analysis of Enzyme Catalysis and Regulation Project Summary: It is of great fundamental and biomedical importance to understand the physical princi- ples that govern the coupling between the chemical step in a biomolecule and other events, such as penetration of water molecules into the active site, recruitment of transient metal ions, or conformational rearrangements near and afar. This is a challenging task, however, due to the intrinsic multi-scale nature of the problem. As a result, our understanding in factors that dictate the efﬁciency and speciﬁcity of enzyme catalysis remains in- complete, especially regarding contributions beyond the active site; this knowledge gap has greatly limited our ability to design highly efﬁcient enzymes de novo. Motivated by these considerations, the overarching theme of our research is to develop and apply multi-scale computational methods to reveal the underlying mechanism of enzyme catalysis at an atomic level, with a particular emphasis on establishing to what degree the chem- ical step is coupled with other processes proximal or distal to the active site. Speciﬁcally, we aim to develop an efﬁcient QM/MM framework to compute free energy proﬁles of enzyme reactions with a good balance of computational speed and accuracy; further integration with enhanced sampling approaches, machine learning techniques and modern computational hardwares enables us to gain insights into the nature of coupling be- tween the chemical step and other events during the functional cycle. Accordingly, we are in a unique position to pursue several lines of exciting applications, which include the mechanism and impact of transient metal ion recruiting in nucleic acid processing enzymes, the catalytic and regulatory mechanism of peripheral membrane enzymes, and systemic analysis of allosteric coupling in a transcription factor; an emerging research direction is to explore the interplay of stability, catalytic activity, and allostery during continuous directed evolution. Our project integrates computational method developments with applications inspired by recent experimental ad- vances, such as time-resolved crystallography, deep mutational scanning and continuous directed evolution. The research efforts will lead to novel computational tools and mechanistic insights into the regulatory mech- anisms of enzymes by processes either near or remote from the active site. Thus the project will have both fundamental impacts and implications for better design strategies for catalysis and allostery in biomolecules. Narrative: The computational methodologies we develop will be applicable to a broad set of metalloen- zymes and proteins of biomedical relevance. In particular, we target fundamental mechanistic problems in enzymes that catalyze nucleic acids synthesis/modiﬁcation and lipid metabolism, since mutations in these en- zymes are implicated in numerous human diseases such as cancer, insulin resistance and diabetes. Although our project does not focus on design of drugs, the mechanistic insights into enzyme catalysis and allosteric regulation will broaden strategies that can be used to target various enzymes of biomedical signiﬁcance.",Computational Analysis of Enzyme Catalysis and Regulation,10206585,R35GM141930,"['Active Sites', 'Allosteric Regulation', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Crystallography', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Distal', 'Drug Design', 'Enzymes', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Free Energy', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Membrane', 'Metals', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Penetration', 'Peripheral', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reaction', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tweens', 'Water', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'enzyme mechanism', 'human disease', 'insight', 'lipid metabolism', 'method development', 'mutation screening', 'novel', 'recruit', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R35,2021,295591,61050884
"Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices Project Summary/Abstract This is a project to develop new statistical methods for comparing groups of subjects in terms of health outcomes that are assessed using data from wearable devices. Inexpensive wearable sensors for health monitoring are now capable of generating massive amounts of data collected longitudinally, up to months at a time. The project will develop inferential methods that can deal with the complexity of such data. A serious challenge is the presence of unmeasured time-dependent confounders (e.g., circadian and dietary patterns), making direct comparisons or borrowing strength across subjects untenable unless the studies are carried out in controlled experimental con- ditions. Generic data mining and machine learning tools have been widely used to provide predictions of health status from such data. However, such tools cannot be used for signiﬁcance testing of covariate effects, which is necessary for designing precision medicine interventions, for example, without taking the inherent model selection or the presence of the unmeasured confounders into account. To overcome these difﬁculties, a systematic de- velopment of inferential methods for functional outcome data obtained from wearable devices will be carried out. There are three speciﬁc aims: 1) Develop metrics for functional outcome data from wearable devices, 2) Develop nonparametric estimation and testing methods for activity proﬁles and a screening method for predictors of activity proﬁles, 3) Implement the methods in an R package and carry out two case studies using accelerometer data. For Aim 1, the approach is to reduce the sensor data to occupation time proﬁles (e.g., as a function of activity level), and formulate the statistical modeling in terms of these proﬁles using survival and functional data analytic meth- ods. This will have a number of advantages, the principal one being that time-dependent confounders become less problematic because the effect of differences in temporal alignment across subjects is mitigated. In addition, survival analysis methods can be applied by viewing the occupation time as a time-to-event outcome indexed by activity level. For Aim 2, nonparametric methods will be used to compare and order occupation time distributions between groups of subjects that are speciﬁed in terms of baseline covariate levels or treatment groups. Further, a new method of post-selection inference based on marginal screening for function-on-scalar regression will be developed to identify and formally test whether covariates are signiﬁcantly associated with activity proﬁles. Aim 3 will develop an R-package implementation, and as a test-bed for the proposed methods they will be applied to two Columbia-based clinical studies: to the study of physical activity in children enrolled in New York City Head Start, and to the study of experimental drugs for the treatment of mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Project Narrative The relevance of the project to public health is that it will develop statistical methods for the physiological eval- uation of patients on the basis of data collected by inexpensive wearable sensors (e.g., accelerometers). By introducing methods for the rigorous comparison of healthcare status among groups of patients observed longi- tudinally over time using such devices, treatment decisions that can beneﬁt targeted populations of patients in terms of continuously-assessed health outcomes will become possible.",Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices,10135813,R01AG062401,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Beds', 'Bypass', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dietary Practices', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Grant', 'Head Start Program', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'New York City', 'Obesity', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Preschool Child', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Survival Analysis', 'Syndrome', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'circadian', 'data mining', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'indexing', 'interest', 'lower income families', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'sensor', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment group', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,298890,558628098
"Statistical Methods in Trans-Omics Chronic Disease Research Project Summary The broad, long-term objectives of this research are the development of novel and high-impact statistical methods for medical studies of chronic diseases, with a focus on trans-omics precision medicine research. The speciﬁc aims of this competing renewal application include: (1) derivation of efﬁcient and robust statistics for integrative association analysis of multiple omics platforms (DNA sequences, RNA expressions, methylation proﬁles, protein expressions, metabolomics proﬁles, etc.) with arbitrary patterns of missing data and with detection limits for quantitative measurements; (2) exploration of statistical learning approaches for handling multiple types of high- dimensional omics variables with structural associations and with substantial missing data; and (3) construction of a multivariate regression model of the effects of somatic mutations on gene expressions in cancer tumors for discovery of subject-speciﬁc driver mutations, leveraging gene interaction network information and accounting for inter-tumor heterogeneity in mutational effects. All these aims have been motivated by the investigators' applied research experience in trans-omics studies of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The proposed solutions are based on likelihood and other sound statistical principles. The theoretical properties of the new statistical methods will be rigorously investigated through innovative use of advanced mathematical arguments. Computationally efﬁcient and numerically stable algorithms will be developed to implement the inference procedures. The new methods will be evaluated extensively with simulation studies that mimic real data and applied to several ongoing trans-omics precision medicine projects, most of which are carried out at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Their scientiﬁc merit and computational feasibility are demonstrated by preliminary simulation results and real examples. Efﬁcient, reliable, and user-friendly open-source software with detailed documentation will be produced and disseminated to the broad scientiﬁc community. The proposed work will advance the ﬁeld of statistical genomics and facilitate trans-omics precision medicine studies of chronic diseases.

"Image-guided Biocuration of Disease Pathways From Scientific Literature Realization of precision medicine ideas requires an unprecedented rapid pace of translation of biomedical discoveries into clinical practice. However, while many non-canonical disease pathways and uncommon drug actions, which are of vital importance for understanding individual patient-specific disease pathways, are accumulated in the literature, most are not organized in databases. Currently, such knowledge is curated manually or semi-automatically in a very limited scope. Meanwhile, the volume of biomedical information in PubMed (currently 28 million publications) keeps growing by more than a million articles per year, which demands more efficient and effective biocuration approaches.  To address this challenge, a novel biocuration method for automatic extraction of disease pathways from figures and text of biomedical articles will be developed.  Specific Aim 1: To develop focused benchmark sets of articles to assess the performance of the biocuration pipeline.  Specific Aim 2: To develop a method for extraction of components of disease pathways from articles’ figures based on deep-learning techniques.  Specific Aim 3: To develop a method for reconstruction of disease-specific pathways through enrichment and through graph neural network (GNN) approaches.  Specific Aim 4: To conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the pipeline.  The overarching goal of this project is to develop a computer-based automatic biocuration ecosystem for rapid transformation of free-text biomedical literature into a machine-processable format for medical applications.  The overall impact of the proposed project will be to significantly improve health outcomes in individualized patient cases by efficiently bringing the latest biomedical discoveries into a precision medicine setting.

"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents.

"Modeling the Incompleteness and Biases of Health Data Modeling the Incompleteness and Biases of Health Data Researchers are increasingly working to “mine” health data to derive new medical knowledge. Unlike experimental data that are collected per a research protocol, the primary role of clinical data is to help clinicians care for patients, so the procedures for its collection are not often systematic. Thus, missing and/or biased data can hinder medical knowledge discovery and data mining efforts. Existing efforts for missing health data imputation often focus on only cross-sectional correlation (e.g., correlation across subjects or across variables) but neglect autocorrelation (e.g., correlation across time points). Moreover, they often focus on modeling incompleteness but neglect the biases in health data. Modeling both the incompleteness and bias may contribute to better understanding of health data and better support clinical decision making. We propose a novel framework of Bias-Aware Missing data Imputation with Cross-sectional correlation and Autocorrelation (BAMICA), and leverage clinical notes to better inform the methods that will otherwise rely on structured health data only. In addition to evaluating its imputation accuracy, we will apply the proposed framework to assist in downstream tasks such as predictive modeling for multiple outcomes across a diverse range of clinical and cohort study datasets. Aim 1 introduces the MICA framework to jointly consider cross-sectional correlation and auto-correlation. In Aim 2, we will augment MICA to be bias-aware (hence BAMICA) to account for biases stemmed from multiple roots such as healthcare process and use them as features in imputing missing health data. This augmentation is achieved by a novel recurrent neural network architecture that keeps track of both evolution of health data variables and bias factors. In Aim 3, we will supplement unstructured clinical notes to structured health data for modeling incompleteness and biases using a novel architecture of graph neural network on top of memory network. We will apply graph neural networks to process clinical notes in order to learn proper representations as input to the memory networks for imputation and downstream predictive modeling tasks. Depending on the clinical problem and data availability, not all modules may be needed. Thus our proposed BAMICA framework is designed to be flexible and consists of selectable modules to meet some or all of the above needs. In summary, our proposal bridges a key knowledge gap in jointly modeling incompleteness and biases in health data and utilizes unstructured clinical notes to supplement and augment such modeling in order to better support predictive modeling and clinical decision making. We will demonstrate generalizability by experimenting on four large clinical and cohort study datasets, and by scaling up to the eMERGE network spanning 11 institutions nationwide. We will disseminate the open-source framework. The principled and flexible framework generated by this project will bring significant methodological advancement and have a direct impact on enhancing discovery from health data.

In addition to evaluating its imputation accuracy, we will apply the proposed framework to assist in downstream tasks such as predictive modeling for multiple outcomes across a diverse range of clinical and cohort study datasets.",Modeling the Incompleteness and Biases of Health Data,10168611,R01LM013337,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'data mining', 'data quality', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'improved', 'lifetime risk', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neglect', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized therapeutic', 'predictive modeling', 'recurrent neural network', 'scale up', 'social health determinants', 'stem', 'structured data', 'text searching', 'tool', 'trait']",NLM,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,315727,367414121
"A magnetic capsule endoscope for colonoscopy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease We propose to develop, optimize, and conduct first in-human measurements of our Magnetic Flexible Endoscope (MFE) robotic platform that may provide a safer and more intelligent alternative to standard colonoscopy (CLS) for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Patients with IBD are at increased risk for colorectal cancer and therefore surveillance has been recommended to occur at intervals less than that recommended for the general population. Thus, over the course of their lifetime, they are subjected to more frequent CLS than their non-lBD counterparts, resulting in a more than 6-fold increase in adverse events. The main risks of CLS are related to procedural sedation, patient discomfort, or perforation of the colon from looping. Looping and mesenteric stretching occur due to the design of the colonoscope. Special maneuvers can be performed to minimize looping, making CLS a procedure that requires a great degree of technical skill and experience to perform safely. By using the proposed robotic platform, the endoscopist will be able to control the motion of the MFE to perform navigation, diagnosis, and therapy (i.e. biopsy, polyp removal/retrieval, injection) inside the human colon. MFE motion is achieved by magnetic coupling between an external permanent magnet (attached to a robotic arm outside the patient's body) and an internal permanent magnet (located inside the proximal head of the MFE). A small-diameter flexible tether between the head of the endoscope and the distal control module (outside the patient's body) allows for passage of commercially available therapeutic tools, insufflation, irrigation, suction/aspiration, and electrical wiring. Employing magnetic attraction at the head of the endoscope, for advancement and manipulation, permits the tether to follow passively-reducing the risk of mesenteric stretching or looping when compared to the traditional colonoscope. We will leverage our experience and extensive preliminary results to test the hypotheses that (1) intelligent robotic control and assistive autonomy in endoscopic tasks improves endoscopic performance, (2) quantifying the portion of colon lumen visualized provides valuable feedback to improve MFE operation and diagnostic yield, and (3) that the MFE is safe and successfully functions in the human colon in a manner similar to conventional CLS. The investigative team, combining engineering and clinical faculty, is uniquely positioned to achieve success of this study-collectively possessing expertise in endoscopic device design, clinical CLS, assessment and validation of innovative gastrointestinal technologies, robotics, magnetism, image processing, artificial intelligence, and translation of research-engineering developments into clinical applications. Additionally, the investigators have a long-standing history of close and fruitful collaboration including R01 EB018992. If successful, this approach will demonstrate first in-human use of the MFE that reduces potential adverse events in an at-risk population (IBD patients), is intuitive to control, and integrates intelligent guidance into colon exploration and inspection. The robotic platform we propose has the potential to provide a safer, more accessible, and potentially painless alternative to standard colonoscopy for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn's disease)-a disease that impacts the lives of over three million Americans, who are at a 6-fold increased risk for post-colonoscopy adverse events when compared to their non-lBD counterparts. The platform uses magnetic actuation, intelligent closed-loop control, and integrated assistive autonomy of our diagnostic and therapeutic magnetic flexible endoscope (MFE) to facilitate intuitive endoscopist-directed motion under precise control with a novel colon-visualization-index (CVI) that provides feedback to the endoscopist with estimates of the portion of colon lumen successfully imaged to maximize the yield of exam. We propose the first in-human study of a magnetically actuated robotic platform for colonoscopy and the first in-human demonstration of intelligent control with assistive autonomy using magnetic fields.",A magnetic capsule endoscope for colonoscopy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease,10121126,R01EB018992,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Articulation', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Cadaver', 'Caliber', 'Cecum', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopes', 'Colonoscopy', 'Complication', 'Coupling', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dysplasia', 'Electric Wiring', 'Endoscopes', 'Endoscopy', 'Engineering', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Injections', 'Insufflation', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Intubation', 'Intuition', 'Irrigation', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Mesentery', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Mucositis', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Nature', 'Nursing Faculty', 'Painless', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perforation', 'Performance', 'Polyps', 'Populations at Risk', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sedation procedure', 'Software Validation', 'Stream', 'Stretching', 'Suction', 'Surface', 'Technical Degree', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'capsule', 'clinical application', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'detection method', 'experience', 'first-in-human', 'flexibility', 'gastrointestinal', 'human study', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'lifetime risk', 'magnetic field', 'novel', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'pain patient', 'phantom model', 'prevent', 'procedure safety', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'robot assistance', 'robot control', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'trial comparing']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,316138,377931988
"CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk Project Summary/Abstract Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In determine an exploratory ML analysis, we will the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and historical predicators; Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative symptoms are strongly linked t o functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative symptom tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains.This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview-based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk,10136105,R01MH120091,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'trait']",NIMH,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2021,317000,83544663
"Assessment of ultrasound features of knee osteoarthritis in a population-based community cohort Project summary Our long-term goal is to demonstrate the utility of ultrasound for OA assessment, standardize its acquisition and scoring, and promote increased uptake of US for use in clinical, research, and trial settings. Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is highly prevalent and frequently debilitating. Development of potential treatments has been hampered by the heterogenous nature of this common chronic condition, which is characterized by a number of subgroups, or phenotypes, with different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Imaging, genetics, biochemical biomarkers, and other features can be used to characterize phenotypes, but variations in data types can make it difficult to harmonize definitions. While radiography is widely used in KOA imaging, it is limited in its ability to assess early disease (when interventions are most likely to succeed) and is insensitive to change. Ultrasound (US) is a widely accessible, time-efficient and cost-effective imaging modality that can provide detailed and reliable information about all joint tissues (e.g., cartilage, meniscus, synovium, bone), and could therefore inform phenotypes in KOA (e.g., by presence of synovitis, effusion, cartilage damage, calcium crystal deposition, and popliteal cysts). Use of US is currently limited by the lack of systematically performed studies in well-characterized non-clinical populations. To address this gap and further the use of this advantageous imaging modality for KOA, we will obtain standardized US and radiography in the population- based Johnston County Health Study (JoCoHS), the new enrollment phase of the 25+ year Johnston County OA Project which includes white, African American, and Hispanic men and women aged 35-70, to achieve three aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the population prevalence (n~3000) of knee US features including cartilage and meniscal damage, synovitis/effusion, calcium crystal deposition, popliteal cysts and osteophytes overall and in key subgroups by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and symptom status. Aim 2 will allow quantification of the associations between these US features and radiographic findings and symptom scores overall and in key subgroups (e.g., those with and without radiographic KOA, by sex, by race/ethnicity). For Aim 3, we will apply novel machine learning methodologies (e.g., Direction-projection-permutation [DiProPerm] hypothesis testing, Joint and Individual Variation [JIVE], and Distance-Weighted Discrimination [DWD]) to a) develop an overall US score for symptomatic KOA and b) identify the contribution of US variables to phenotypes relevant to KOA based on general health, physical activity, and functional assessments. This study is a crucial step to establish the foundation for US as an assessment tool for clinical use, research, and clinical trials in KOA, providing unique population-based cross-sectional data regarding the utility of US and forming the basis for future longitudinal work evaluating its value and performance characteristics related to incident and progressive KOA. Project narrative Osteoarthritis is an enormous and increasing public health problem that, like many other chronic conditions, is not a single disease but a heterogeneous condition consisting of multiple subgroups, or phenotypes, with differing underlying mechanisms. Ultrasound is an accessible, time-efficient, and cost-effective imaging modality that provides invaluable data about all joint tissues involved in osteoarthritis and has the potential to identify important phenotypes. The proposed work is relevant to the NIAMS mission and represents a crucial step to establish the foundation for ultrasound as an assessment tool for use in clinics, research, and clinical trials in osteoarthritis.",Assessment of ultrasound features of knee osteoarthritis in a population-based community cohort,10158441,R01AR077060,"['Address', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Spur', 'Calcium', 'Cartilage', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Claustrophobias', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Assessment Tool', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'County', 'Crystal Formation', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Popliteal Cyst', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Differences', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Synovial Membrane', 'Synovitis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'bone', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'effusion', 'follow-up', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'men', 'novel', 'point of care', 'population based', 'recruit', 'rheumatologist', 'sex', 'uptake']",NIAMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,331837,511185245
"Personalized Management of Intracranial Aneurysms Using Computer-aided Analytics Abstract The primary objective is to develop an artificial intelligence-centric, quantitative and noninvasive software platform that can be integrated into 3D angiographic scanners (DSA, CTA or MRA) to provide guidance regarding the diagnosis and management of intracranial aneurysms (IA). Hemorrhagic stroke secondary to ruptured IAs leads to significant morbidity and mortality and affects over 35,000 patients on a yearly basis in the United States. The diagnosis of asymptomatic IAs is on the rise with the increasing use of cerebral imaging. However, guidance regarding which aneurysms should be treated has not advanced. Leveraging recent advances in computational science and technology, particularly artificial intelligence, the proposed software platform built on two enabling technologies can (1) propel automated “patient-specific” hemodynamic evaluations into the clinical workflow and (2) conduct “data-driven” risk assessments of IA rupture on an individual basis. Specific research aims are to (1) develop a clinically-oriented CFD platform that enables automated “patient-specific” hemodynamic evaluations of IAs, (2) investigate data-driven analytics toward prediction of rupture risk for IAs and (3) evaluate the data-driven analytics in a blind study. Once validated, a follow-up R01 project is planned to examine the clinical utility of the proposed software platform in a prospective clinical study as a single gateway for computer-aided evaluation of cerebral aneurysms. Public Health Relevance/Narrative This R01 proposal is to investigate the feasibility of developing an innovative, non-invasive and artificial intelligence-centric tool that can be used as a software add-on to clinical angiographic (e.g. DSA) scanners. The software can automatically select high-risk aneurysms for immediate treatments from a pool of patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms, impacting the clinical management of intracranial aneurysms.",Personalized Management of Intracranial Aneurysms Using Computer-aided Analytics,10121043,R01EB029570,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Aneurysm', 'Angiography', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benign', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cerebral Aneurysm', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Geometry', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Genetic', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intracranial Aneurysm', 'Knowledge', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Natural History', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Aneurysm', 'Secondary to', 'Smoker', 'Technology', 'TensorFlow', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'blind', 'computer grid', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'neurosurgery', 'open source', 'personalized management', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'shear stress', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,MICHIGAN TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,346966,4826901
"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems.

"Lagrangian computational modeling for biomedical data science The goal of the project is to develop a new mathematical and computational modeling framework for from biomedical data extracted from biomedical experiments such as voltages, spectra (e.g. mass, magnetic resonance, impedance, optical absorption, …), microscopy or radiology images, gene expression, and many others. Scientists who are looking to understand relationships between different molecular and cellular measurements are often faced with questions involving deciphering differences between different cell or organ measurements. Current approaches (e.g. feature engineering and classification, end-to-end neural networks) are often viewed as “black boxes,” given their lack of connection to any biological mechanistic effects. The approach we propose builds from the “ground up” an entirely new modeling framework build based on recently developed invertible transformation. As such, it allows for any machine learning model to be represented in original data space, allowing for not only increased accuracy in prediction, but also direct visualization and interpretation. Preliminary data including drug screening, modeling morphological changes in cancer, cardiac image reconstruction, modeling subcellular organization, and others are discussed. Mathematical data analysis algorithms have enabled great advances in technology for building predictive models from biological data which have been useful for learning about cells and organs, as well as for stratifying patient subgroups in different diseases, and other applications. Given their lack to fundamental biophysics properties, the modeling approaches in current existence (e.g. numerical feature engineering, artificial neural networks) have significant short-comings when applied to biological data analysis problems.

"Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY  Metabolite levels in human blood are regulated by a relatively strict system of homeostatic control. Previous investigations of homeostasis have taken a number of approaches, and models of glucose and a few other metabolites have been developed, typically focused on a single organ. However, while potentially extremely useful, an accurate and quantitative model of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis does not currently exist.  It is well known that numerous demographic and clinical factors such as gender, age, BMI, smoking, etc., as well as pre-analytical factors and many diseases, significantly affect the levels of blood metabolites. Numerous studies in the field of metabolomics have attempted to account for the effects of many such factors. However, efforts to quantify these effects and validate them across different studies have so far been challenging, and resulted in consistent failures to validate discovered putative biomarkers. The challenges to integrate metabolite profiles with clinical and demographic factors are complicated by the high dimensionality of the data and the numerous correlations among the metabolites. Traditional statistical methods are incapable of accounting for these factors, and hence, investigations suffer from a high false discovery rate (FDR).  To overcome these challenges, we propose to develop quantitative statistical models of blood metabolite levels in healthy adults, and thereby produce a predictive model of homeostasis. Our preliminary work indicates that we can predict metabolite levels with much reduced variance using the reproducibly measured levels of a large pool of blood metabolites and clinical and demographic variables. We propose to develop sophisticated models of homeostasis based on advanced statistical methods and evaluate their predictive performance across different sample sets and metabolite classes.  The proposed project has four main Aims: (1) Obtain broad-based metabolomics data on blood samples collected from geographically distinct sites to explore the effects of a range of confounding effects on metabolite levels. (2) Model individual or biologically related groups of metabolite levels using multivariate statistical approaches to determine the contribution of clinical/demographic and pre-analytical variables and their predictability across collection site. (3) Investigate the interactions between metabolites and clinical/demographic variables using machine learning approaches to identify stable metabolites and key interactions. (4) Provide the community with user-friendly software packages for the prediction of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis.  An overall model of the metabolite concentrations in blood will be highly useful for a number of applications that include a better understanding of systems biology at the whole organism level, and ultimately improved risk prediction, disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring and outcomes analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE A quantitative model of blood homeostasis based on predicting the normal levels of small molecules in the blood can help identify diseases or other stresses that cause changes to those levels. The proposed statistical methods that will be used to develop this homeostasis model have the potential to efficiently identify more reliable disease markers and to more accurately predict disease risk.",Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites,10159296,R01GM131491,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Gases', 'Gender', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Glucose', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolite Interaction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical effect', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'data quality', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'lipidomics', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'predictive modeling', 'sample collection', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,376064,533302350
"Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records Abstract. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects 30-40% of hospitalized older adults, with the added cost of care estimated to be up to $7 billion. Although originally conceptualized as a transient disorder, delirium is now recognized to have significant consequences, including increased risk of death, functional decline, and long-term cognitive impairment. As up to 75% cases are not recognized by providers, there is an urgent need for additional methods to identify delirium for clinical and research purposes, and to stratify patients based on delirium risk. In this proposal, we present a novel approach to the identification of delirium based on large-scale data mining (i.e., pattern recognition) algorithms using machine learning and natural language processing applied to electronic health record (EHR) data, which will automate chart-based determination of delirium status and risk prediction. We will combine these algorithms with data collected through our recently implemented Virtual Acute Care for Elders (ACE) quality improvement project, which institutes delirium screening once per shift by nursing staff for all individuals over age 65 admitted to the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Hospital. This unprece- dented volume of data will allow us to achieve the necessary sample sizes for effective training and validation of our data mining algorithms. Data mining algorithms that discover patterns of associations in data, rather than testing predetermined hypotheses, are well suited to application in large-scale algorithms for identification of delirium. Using our Virtual ACE and hospital EHR data, we will be able to evaluate more than 10,000 individual features (e.g., text words and phrases, laboratory and other diagnostic tests, concurrent medical conditions) as- sociated with delirium, which will be classified as risk factors for delirium, as signs, symptoms, and descriptors of delirium itself, and as complications and consequences of delirium, based on expert consensus. We will then use these features to develop rules for identification of delirium in the EHR, as well as risk prediction models that can be integrated into the EHR to provide individualized assessments of delirium risk. This study will lay the foundation for methods of automated delirium identification and risk prediction in healthcare settings that are unable to implement the screening by providers done in our Virtual ACE, as well as for large-scale epidemiological investigations of delirium using EHR data, expanding the current armamentarium for studying this common and debilitating disorder. Project Narrative. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects up to 7 million hospitalized older adults annu- ally and is associated with long-term declines in cognition and function, but is not recognized by providers in up to 75% of cases. The growth of electronic health records offers a unique opportunity to improve recognition of delir- ium, as methods for identifying delirium based on chart review by clinicians have been developed but are time- and resource-intensive. In this secondary data analysis, we will examine methods for automating delirium recog- nition and risk prediction in electronic health records using machine learning and natural language processing computer algorithms, which in turn will lead to improved care for this serious but often overlooked disorder.",Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records,10091381,R01AG060993,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Alabama', 'Algorithms', 'Ally', 'Assessment tool', 'Automation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational algorithm', 'Confusion', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Delirium', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Foundations', 'Growth', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institutes', 'Institutionalization', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Staff', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Provider', 'ROC Curve', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'acute care', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'care costs', 'confusion assessment method', 'data mining', 'epidemiology study', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'health care settings', 'high dimensionality', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'model development', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'phrases', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'validation studies', 'virtual', 'ward']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2021,376860,325573502
"A Quantitative Risk Model for Predicting Outcome and Identifying Structural Biomarkers of Treatment Targets in Oral Cancer on a Large Multi-Center Patient Cohort Post-resection prognostication for oral cavity cancers (OCC) is qualitative and potentially ambiguous. A significant subset (25-37%) of Stage I/II patients still develop local recurrence after treatment with surgery alone. The long-term goal of this proposal will be to create a Quantitative Risk Model (QRM) using machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II patients using image-based biomarkers of aggression. The objective is to develop and validate state-of-the-art systems for biomarker imaging, quantification, and modeling to accurately predict risk of recurrence in cancer patients based on image analytics. The central hypothesis is that a quantitative, artificial intelligence approach to pathology will result in significantly greater prognostic value compared with manual microscope-based analysis. The rationale for this work is that tumor aggression can be predicted from patterns present in pathology images, given the existence of histological risk models that have been clinically validated in the past; however, these risk models are not in widespread use because they are less accurate, robust, and transportable to the larger community of pathologists. This proposal will test the central hypothesis through three specific aims: (1) Develop an analysis pipeline that can accurately predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II OCC patients and identify treatment targets (e.g. adaptive local immune response and angiogenesis); (2) Demonstrate robust performance across a multi-site data cohort collected from seven national and international centers; and (3) Distil the results of QRM analysis to synoptic pathology reporting, demonstrating the ability of QRM to interface with standard clinical reporting tools. The innovation for addressing these aims comes from a unique application of active learning for training artificial intelligence to recognize tissue structures, new features for quantifying tissue architecture based on the interface between tumor and host, and a novel approach for large cross-site validation. Moreover, this proposal develops a unique mapping between computational pathology and commonly-used synoptic reporting variables, enabling rapid uptake of this work into existing clinical workflows. This research is significant because it provides personalized outcome predictions for a niche group of undertreated patients with limited options and can serve as the foundation for designing future clinical trials through identification of treatment targets. Multi-site training and evaluation, combined with AI-to-report mapping, will be broadly applicable to a large group of computational approaches, bridging the gap between engineering research labs and clinical application. The expected outcome of this work is a trained model for predicting Stage I/II OCC recurrence, identification of treatment targets, and mapping to synoptic reports, as well as a broadly-applicable workflow for the broader computational pathology community. This project will have a large positive impact on patients and surgical pathologists by enabling rapid, accurate prognosis and directed treatment plans in an easy-to-use pipeline that integrates seamlessly into existing clinical workflows. We aim to develop a quantitative risk model for oral cavity cancer patients, 25-37% of whom will experience debilitating post-treatment recurrence. Using state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence methods, we will develop and validate our risk model on a large multi-site cohort of patients, and develop an AI-assisted synoptic report-filling tool for integrating into clinical practice. A computational pathology approach to characterizing disease will help identify patients for whom aggressive multimodality therapy will improve outcomes and post-treatment quality of life.",A Quantitative Risk Model for Predicting Outcome and Identifying Structural Biomarkers of Treatment Targets in Oral Cancer on a Large Multi-Center Patient Cohort,10149283,R01DE028741,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Head and neck structure', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical Economics', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral Stage', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Postoperative Period', 'Productivity', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Workload', 'analysis pipeline', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer type', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computational pipelines', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'feature extraction', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'international center', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'pathology imaging', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'quality assurance', 'quantitative imaging', 'screening', 'segmentation algorithm', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'uptake']",NIDCR,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2021,380042,73424103
"2/5 CAPER Computerized assessment of psychosis risk Summary  Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In an exploratory ML historical analysis, we will determine the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and predicators;Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative are more strongly linked to functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative mechanism tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains.This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk.

"Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure The overarching goal of this project is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF). HF, whether with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved (HFpEF) ejection fraction, is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. In the U.S. alone, HF affects over 5 million adults, and the prevalence is projected to exceed 8 million by 2030. HF is the most frequent cause of hospitalization among Medicare recipients and results in over $30 billion in health care expenditures each year. Advances in management, especially for HFrEF, have modestly reduced death rates over time, but mortality continues to be high, with approximately half of patients dying within 5 years of diagnosis. Moreover, the pace of drug discovery has been slow, and there are no proven therapies for patients suffering with HFpEF. Among patients with established HF there is substantial variation in illness severity, degree of cardiac remodeling, disease progression, and response to therapy. These observations highlight the heterogeneity of the HF syndrome and suggest existence of subtypes with differing clinical and potentially genetic profiles, with subsequent differences in downstream disease mechanisms, overall risk, and therapeutic response. However, the understanding of the phenotypic, genetic, and pathophysiological heterogeneity of HF is incomplete. This project investigates the phenotypic substructure and genetic architecture of HF by leveraging a unique collection of interrelated datasets from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), including the de- identified electronic health record (EHR) and BioVU, a linked DNA biobank. The EHR contains ~2.6 million patients, including ~35,000 with HF, and BioVU currently houses >225,000 DNA samples. Dense genotype data are available in >28,000 subjects and an institutional genotyping project will increase this to >125,000 by mid- 2017; this includes >13,000 subjects with HF. The proposed research will: 1) identify HF subtypes from dense clinical data alone using advanced, unbiased, deep learning algorithms (Aim 1), 2) define the genetic architecture of HF and HF subtypes by using inferred gene expression, general linear mixed models, genetic risk scores, and traditional association testing to quantify heritability of and genetic correlations among HF subtypes, define the contribution of established risk factors to HF subtypes, and 3) discover subtype-specific genetic risk factors (Aim 2), and discover HF subtype-specific clinical outcomes, disease associations, and drug response phenotypes using advanced phenome scanning and network analysis (Aim 3). Heart failure (HF) is a complex, debilitating syndrome associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The heterogeneity of HF has limited success of prior efforts to understand HF pathobiology and develop effective interventions. By defining clinical and genetic modifiers of HF risk, disease course, and treatment response for clinically recognized and novel, data-driven HF subtypes, results from this work could result in a more sophisticated HF classification system based on underlying biology, and ultimately facilitate precision risk stratification, tailoring of therapeutic strategies, and rational HF clinical trials.",Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure,10076848,R01HL140074,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'EFRAC', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart failure', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severity of illness', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'defined contribution', 'disease phenotype', 'drug discovery', 'effective intervention', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'preservation', 'response', 'risk variant', 'success', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,395000,377931988
"Accounting for Hidden Bias in Vaccine Studies: A Negative Control Framework Project Summary / Abstract The proposed research aims to develop novel causal inference methods to resolve unmeasured confounding bias known to plague vaccine effectiveness and safety studies by leveraging so-called negative control variables widely available in vaccine studies. A negative control outcome is a variable known not to be causally affected by the treatment of interest, while a negative control exposure is a variable known not to causally affect the outcome of interest. Both share a common confounding mechanism as the exposure-outcome pair of primary interest. Examples of negative controls abound in vaccine studies. Such known-null effects form the basis of falsiﬁca- tion strategy to detect unmeasured confounding, however little is known about when and how negative controls can be used to resolve unmeasured confounding bias. We plan to develop principled negative control methods for identiﬁcation and semiparametric estimation of causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding, incorporating modern highly adaptive machine learning methods. We also plan to develop negative control meth- ods to detect and quantify causal effects in complex longitudinal and survival settings critical to vaccine studies using routinely collected healthcare data. Finally we plan to apply the proposed methods to evaluate vaccine effectiveness using data collected from a pioneering test-negative design platform and to monitor vaccine safety using electronic health record data. Successful completion of the proposed research will equip investigators with paradigm-shifting methods to unlock the full potential of contemporary healthcare data, encourage investigators to routinely check for evidence of confounding bias, and ultimately improve the validity of scientiﬁc research. Project Narrative The proposed research will develop statistical methods to detect and resolve unmeasured confounding bias by leveraging prior knowledge about known-null effects widely available but often underappreciated in healthcare data — thereby facilitating valid and reproducible research in vaccine effectiveness and safety studies.",Accounting for Hidden Bias in Vaccine Studies: A Negative Control Framework,10093358,R01GM139926,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Plague', 'Plague Vaccine', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'adverse event risk', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'public health priorities', 'safety study', 'semiparametric', 'theories', 'tool', 'user friendly software', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine evaluation', 'vaccine safety', 'vaccine trial']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,401613,641965656
"Artificial intelligence Optical Coherence Tomography Guided Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty (AUTO-DALK) PROJECT SUMMARY  Contemporary ocular surgeries are performed by skilled surgeons through operating microscopes, utilizing freehand techniques and manually operated precision micro-instruments, where the outcomes are often limited by the surgeon's skill levels and experiences. To overcome these human factors, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team including a clinician-scientist and eye surgeon, an optical device scientist and medical robotic engineers to translate existing and developing technologies in our laboratories into precision, “deep- learning” artificial intelligence (AI) guided robotic ocular surgical devices for precise automated Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty (AUTO-DALK).  DALK is a highly attractive treatment of corneal disease with normally functioning endothelium. However, the procedure is unusually challenging from a technical perspective and time-consuming, limiting its acceptance among corneal surgeons. The most challenging aspect of the procedure is related to the delamination of stroma from Descemet's membrane (DM). A procedure, commonly called “Big Bubble” is used to separate stroma from DM using deep intrastromal pneumatic injection. However, even experienced surgeons have difficulty precisely placing the injection. The most common complication of DALK is the excessive depth of the needle insertion resulting in Descemet's membrane perforation requiring conversion to full-thickness penetrating keratoplasty with its much longer recovery period and a higher risk of graft failure from rejection. The reported rates of Descemet's membrane perforation for beginner and experienced surgeons are 31.8% and 11.7% respectively. In addition, interface haze between the donor and recipient cornea is a common problem caused by the insufficient depth of needle insertion and failure to remove the host stromal tissue, which results in loss of postoperative visual acuity. These problems relate directly to the inability of the current surgical practice to precisely assess the depth of the tooltips inside the cornea layer in real-time.  Here we will build upon our previous and ongoing work in robust fiber optic common-path optical coherence tomography (CP-OCT) and AI-guide system based on convolutional neural network (CNN) robotic microsurgical tools that enable clinicians to precisely guide surgical tools at micron scale. The proposed AUTO- DALK surgical tool system is capable of one-dimensional real-time depth tracking, motion compensation, and detection of early instrument contact with tissue, which enables clinicians to perform DALK precisely and safely. The tool will be built on a handheld platform that will consist of CP-OCT probe, trephine and microinjector that allows precise and safe removal of the anterior section of cornea down to DM  We hypothesize that AI-OCT providing intelligent visualization and depth controlled optimal cornea cutting and tissue tracking will perform the task of DALK with better accuracy and efficiency over the manually performed trephine cutting and “Big Bubble” pneumodissection. Project Narrative  This proposal addresses fundamental limitations in current corneal transplant surgery by developing an artificial intelligence guided compact robotic surgical tool that could empower corneal surgeons to achieve difficult surgical objectives, reduce intraoperative complications, and improve clinical outcomes when performing Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty (DALK). Further, these capabilities are broadly applicable in other microsurgical problems, and the tools will enable further advances both for ophthalmology and for other microsurgical disciplines.",Artificial intelligence Optical Coherence Tomography Guided Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty (AUTO-DALK),10100636,R01EY032127,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Animal Model', 'Anterior', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blindness', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Burr hole procedure', 'Cadaver', 'Clinical', 'Complication', 'Consumption', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Corneal Opacity', 'Corneal dystrophy', 'Data', 'Descemet&apos', 's membrane', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Distal', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Endophthalmitis', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelium', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial', 'Excision', 'Expert Systems', 'Eye', 'Eye Surgeon', 'Failure', 'Fiber Optics', 'Financial compensation', 'Geometry', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Graft Survival', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Injections', 'Intelligence', 'Intraoperative Complications', 'Iris', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Laboratories', 'Lamellar Keratoplasty', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Needles', 'Ocular Hypertension', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Outcome', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patients', 'Penetrating Keratoplasty', 'Perforation', 'Performance', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Ptosis', 'Recovery', 'Repeat Surgery', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Rupture', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Topical Corticosteroids', 'Translating', 'Transplantation Surgery', 'Trauma', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'corneal scar', 'curative treatments', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'graft failure', 'high risk', 'iatrogenic injury', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'instrument', 'interest', 'novel', 'phantom model', 'photonics', 'preservation', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'skills', 'surgery outcome', 'tool']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,409997,807432003
"Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY  Metabolite levels in human blood are regulated by a relatively strict system of homeostatic control. Previous investigations of homeostasis have taken a number of approaches, and models of glucose and a few other metabolites have been developed, typically focused on a single organ. However, while potentially extremely useful, an accurate and quantitative model of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis does not currently exist.  It is well known that numerous demographic and clinical factors such as gender, age, BMI, smoking, etc., as well as pre-analytical factors and many diseases, significantly affect the levels of blood metabolites. Numerous studies in the field of metabolomics have attempted to account for the effects of many such factors. However, efforts to quantify these effects and validate them across different studies have so far been challenging, and resulted in consistent failures to validate discovered putative biomarkers. The challenges to integrate metabolite profiles with clinical and demographic factors are complicated by the high dimensionality of the data and the numerous correlations among the metabolites. Traditional statistical methods are incapable of accounting for these factors, and hence, investigations suffer from a high false discovery rate (FDR).  To overcome these challenges, we propose to develop quantitative statistical models of blood metabolite levels in healthy adults, and thereby produce a predictive model of homeostasis. Our preliminary work indicates that we can predict metabolite levels with much reduced variance using the reproducibly measured levels of a large pool of blood metabolites and clinical and demographic variables. We propose to develop sophisticated models of homeostasis based on advanced statistical methods and evaluate their predictive performance across different sample sets and metabolite classes.  The proposed project has four main Aims: (1) Obtain broad-based metabolomics data on blood samples collected from geographically distinct sites to explore the effects of a range of confounding effects on metabolite levels. (2) Model individual or biologically related groups of metabolite levels using multivariate statistical approaches to determine the contribution of clinical/demographic and pre-analytical variables and their predictability across collection site. (3) Investigate the interactions between metabolites and clinical/demographic variables using machine learning approaches to identify stable metabolites and key interactions. (4) Provide the community with user-friendly software packages for the prediction of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis.  An overall model of the metabolite concentrations in blood will be highly useful for a number of applications that include a better understanding of systems biology at the whole organism level, and ultimately improved risk prediction, disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring and outcomes analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE A quantitative model of blood homeostasis based on predicting the normal levels of small molecules in the blood can help identify diseases or other stresses that cause changes to those levels. The proposed statistical methods that will be used to develop this homeostasis model have the potential to efficiently identify more reliable disease markers and to more accurately predict disease risk.",Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites,10372262,R01GM131491,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Gases', 'Gender', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Glucose', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolite Interaction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical effect', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'data quality', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'lipidomics', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'predictive modeling', 'sample collection', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,431464,533302350
"Big Data Methods for Comprehensive Similarity based Risk Prediction Project Summary Electronic health records (EHR) provide rich source of data about representative populations and are yet to be fully utilized to enhance clinical decision-making. Conventional approaches in clinical decision-making start with the identification of relevant biomarkers based on subject-matter knowledge, followed by detailed but limited analysis using these biomarkers exclusively. As the current scientific literature indicates, many human disorders share a complex etiological basis and exhibit correlated disease progression. Therefore, it is desirable to use comprehensive patient data for patient similarity. This proposal focuses on deriving a comprehensive and integrated score of patient similarity from complete patient characteristics currently available, including but not limited to 1) demographic similarity; 2) genetic similarity; 3) clinical phenotype similarity; 4) treatment similarity; and 5) exposome similarity (here exposome defined as all available attributes of the living environment an individual is exposed to), when some of the aspects may overlap and interact. We will optimize information fusion and task-dependent feature selection for assessing patient similarity for clinical risk prediction. Since currently there does not exist a pipeline that is able to extract executable complete patient determinant data, to achieve the research goal described above, we propose first deliver an open- source data preparation pipeline that is based on a widely used clinical data standard, the OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) Common Data Model (CMD) version 5.2. Moreover, to mitigate common missingness and sparsity challenges in clinical data, we describe the first attempt to represent patients' sparse clinical information with missingness, including diagnosis information, medication data, treatment intervention, with a fixed-length feature vector (i.e. the Patient2Vec). This project has four specific aims. Aim 1 is to develop a clinical data processing pipeline for harmonizing patient information from multiple sources into a standards-based uniformed data representation and to evaluate its efficiency, interoperability, and accuracy. Aim 2 is to leverage a powerful machine learning technique, Document2Vec, from the natural language processing literature, to create an open-source Patient2Vec framework for the derivation of informative numerical representations of patients. Aim 3 is to develop a unified machine learning clinical- outcome-prediction framework for Optimized Patient Similarity Fusion (OptPSF) that integrates traditional medical covariates with the derived numerical patient representations from Patient2Vec (Aim 2) for improved clinical risk prediction. Aim 4 is to evaluate our similarity framework for predicting 1) the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in general EHR patient population and 2) the risk of death among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The project focus on developing a novel data science pipeline which includes a clinical data processing pipeline to format comprehensive patient health determinants from a variety of sources of clinical, genomic, socioenvironmental data, and a clinical-outcome-prediction framework that optimally fuses relevant patient health determinants to define patient similarity for improved clinical risk predictions.",Big Data Methods for Comprehensive Similarity based Risk Prediction,10087958,R01LM013061,"['Address', 'Automation', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biometry', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data modeling', 'data standards', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'feature selection', 'health data', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient health information', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'socioeconomics', 'support tools', 'vector']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,455669,558628098
"Automated Risk Assessment for School Violence Prevention PROJECT SUMMARY Acts of school violence have increased over the past decade and over 20% of students report being bullied at school. School violence has a far-reaching impact on the entire school population, including staff, students and families. It was noted that the largest crime-prevention results occurred when youth at elevated risk were given effective prevention programs. As such, there is a critical need for developing a rapid and accurate approach to interview students, assess their risk characteristics, and provide supportive evidence for prevention. Our study focuses on detecting and preventing youth aggression, the predominant form of school violence. Several risk assessment scales, ranging from simple clinical impressions to structured professional judgments, have been proposed to identify youth violence. However, these assessments heavily rely on clinicians' subjec- tive impressions and their predictive validities remain a major issue. In addition, none of the risk assessments include direct analysis of the words (language) used by students and hence, provide little information to sup- port subsequent prevention. Our long-term goal is to develop an Automated RIsk Assessment (ARIA) system to analyze participant interviews, detect elevated-risk students, and provide risk characteristics (e.g., impul- sivity, negative thoughts) to assist prevention. In our earlier study we developed a risk assessment approach to interview students and evaluate their risk of aggression. The overall objective of this study is to validate our risk assessment approach with real-world evidence, and to develop an AIRA system to automate the assessment process. We hypothesize that our risk assessment approach will have sufficient predictive validity in predicting aggression at school, and a computerized system leveraging machine learning and natural language pro- cessing (NLP) will be able to detect high-risk students, identify violence-related predictors from linguistic con- tent, and improve subsequent prevention by assisting recommendations. The hypothesis will be tested by pur- suing three specific aims: 1) Evaluate the predictive validity and generalizability of our risk assessment approach with prospectively collected school-based outcomes; 2) Develop a high-performing ARIA system to identify risk characteristics and predict risk of school violence; and 3) Compare actionable recommenda- tions and school outcomes with and without using the ARIA system in a prospective observational study. The study is highly innovative in that it will be among the first efforts that leverage NLP and machine learning to analyze interviews, identify risk characteristics from student language, and predict violence outcomes. The study will have a significant impact on several fronts. Successful validation of our risk assessment approach on multiple sites (Aim 1) will provide a valid mechanism to detect youth aggression at school. The AIRA system developed in Aim 2 will enable accurate and scalable risk screening for individual students. Aim 3 is a bench-to-practice translational aim to rapidly transfer our findings to clinical practice. The study will help establish a nationwide solution for school violence risk assessment, which will benefit healthcare institutions, schools, and students. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study aims to develop an Automated RIsk Assessment (ARIA) system to analyze participant interviews, detect students at elevated risk of school violence, and provide risk characteristics to assist prevention. The proposed research is relevant to public health because developing an ARIA system will help establish a nationwide solution for detecting and preventing school violence. The objectives of this proposal are consistent with NICHD's high-priority research areas that aim to develop new knowledge about the identification, etiology, early intervention, and mechanisms of violence from childhood through early adulthood.",Automated Risk Assessment for School Violence Prevention,10096109,R01HD103630,"['Achievement', 'Adolescent', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Dropout', 'Early Intervention', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Legal Guardians', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Process Assessment', 'Property', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'ROC Curve', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'bullying', 'clinical practice', 'computerized', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'school violence', 'school violence prevention', 'screening', 'study population', 'youth violence']",NICHD,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2021,457950,168440418
"Integrative Predictors of Temporomandibular Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This application proposes the development of efficient web-based data management, mining, and analytics, to integrate and analyze clinical, biological, and high dimensional imaging data from TMJ OA patients. Based on our published results, we hypothesize that patterns of condylar bone structure, clinical symptoms, and biological mediators are unrecognized indicators of the severity of progression of TMJ OA. Efficiently capturing, curating, managing, integrating and analyzing this data in a manner that maximizes its value and accessibility is critical for the scientific advances and benefits that such comprehensive TMJ OA patient information may enable. High dimensional databases are increasingly difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional processing applications, creating a continuing demand for innovative approaches. Toward this end, the DCBIA at the Univ. of Michigan has partnered with the University of North Carolina, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Kitware Inc. Through high-dimensional quantitative characterization of individuals with TMJ OA, at molecular, clinical and imaging levels, we will identify phenotypes at risk for more severe prognosis, as well as targets for future therapies. The proposed web-based system, the Data Storage for Computation and Integration (DSCI), will remotely compute machine learning, image analysis, and advanced statistics from prospectively collected longitudinal data on patients with TMJ OA. Due to its ubiquitous design in the web, DSCI software installation will no longer be required. Our long-term goal is to create software and data repository for Osteoarthritis of the TMJ. Such repository requires maintaining the data in a distributed computational environment to allow contributions to the database from multi-clinical centers and to share trained models for TMJ classification. In years 4 and 5 of the proposed work, the dissemination and training of clinicians at the Schools of Dentistry at the University of North Carol, Univ. of Minnesota and Oregon Health Sciences will allow expansion of the proposed studies. In Aim 1, we will test state-of-the-art neural network structures to develop a combined software module that will include the most efficient and accurate neural network architecture and advanced statistics to mine imaging, clinical and biological TMJ OA markers identified at baseline. In Aim 2, we propose to develop novel data analytics tools, evaluating the performance of various machine learning and statistical predictive models, including customized- Gaussian Process Regression, extreme boosted trees, Multivariate Varying Coefficient Model, Lasso, Ridge and Elastic net, Random Forest, pdfCluster, decision tree, and support vector machine. Such automated solutions will leverage emerging computing technologies to determine risk indicators for OA progression in longitudinal cohorts of TMJ health and disease.

"An Integrated Multilevel Modeling Framework for Repertoire-Based Diagnostics Immune-repertoire sequence, which consists of an individual's millions of unique antibody and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes, encodes a dynamic and highly personalized record of an individual's state of health. Our long- term goal is to develop the computational models and tools necessary to read this record, to one day be able diagnose diverse infections, autoimmune diseases, cancers, and other conditions directly from repertoire se- quence. The key problem is how to find patterns of specific diseases in repertoire sequence, when repertoires are so complex. Our hypothesis is that a combination of bottom-up (sequence-level) and top-down (systems- level) modeling can reveal these patterns, by encoding repertoires as simple but highly informative models that can be used to build highly sensitive and specific disease classifiers. In preliminary studies, we introduced two new modeling approaches for this purpose: (i) statistical biophysics (bottom-up) and (ii) functional diversity (top-down), and showed their ability to elucidate patterns related to vaccination status (97% accuracy), viral infection, and aging. Building on these studies, we will test our hypothesis through two specific aims: (1) We will develop models and classifiers based on the bottom-up approach, statistical biophysics; and (2) we will de- velop the top-down approach, functional diversity, to improve these classifiers. To achieve these aims, we will use our extensive collection of public immune-repertoire datasets, beginning with 391 antibody and TCR da- tasets we have characterized previously. Our team has deep and complementary expertise in developing computational tools for finding patterns in immune repertoires (Dr. Arnaout) and in the mathematics that under- lie these tools (Dr. Altschul), with additional advice available as needed regarding machine learning (Dr. AlQuraishi). This proposal is highly innovative for how our two new approaches address previous issues in the field. (i) Statistical biophysics uses a powerful machine-learning method called maximum-entropy modeling (MaxEnt), improving on past work by tailoring MaxEnt to learn patterns encoded in the biophysical properties (e.g. size and charge) of the amino acids that make up antibodies/TCRs; these properties ultimately determine what targets antibodies/TCRs can bind, and therefore which sequences are present in different diseases. (ii) Functional diversity fills a key gap in how immunological diversity has been measured thus far, by factoring in whether different antibodies/TCRs are likely to bind the same target. This proposal is highly significant for (i) developing an efficient, accurate, generative, and interpretable machine-learning method for finding diagnostic patterns in repertoire sequence; (ii) applying a robust mathematical framework to the measurement of immuno- logical diversity; (iii) impacting clinical diagnostics; and (iv) adding a valuable new tool for integrative/big-data medicine. The expected outcome of this proposal is an integrated pair of robust and well validated new tools/models for classifying specific disease exposures directly from repertoire sequence. This proposal in- cludes plans to make these tools widely available, to maximize their positive impact across medicine. The proposed research is relevant to public health because B cells/antibodies and T cells play vital roles across such a vast range of health conditions, from infection, to autoimmunity, to cancer, that the ability to de- code what they are doing would be an important step forward for diagnosing these conditions. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission of fostering fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving health, specifically relating to the diagnosis of human diseases.",An Integrated Multilevel Modeling Framework for Repertoire-Based Diagnostics,10165490,R01AI148747,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Base Sequence', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Fostering', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Privatization', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Errors', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Speed', 'Statistical Study', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Cell Receptor Genes', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vaccination', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'clinical diagnostics', 'computerized tools', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'human disease', 'immunological diversity', 'improved', 'information model', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilevel analysis', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'tool']",NIAID,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,528873,135941803
"Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors ABSTRACT  The NIA has called for social science and community-based studies to clarify risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), particularly among racial minorities who are disproportionately affected. Place, including both neighborhood of residence and region/state of birth, has consistently been correlated with ADRD, stroke, and impaired cognitive function. Yet it is unclear whether modifiable mechanisms explain this association, or whether the association is merely due to the selection of unhealthy individuals into poor regions. The goal of this study is to produce the first quasi-experimental evidence to understand the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation on ADRD and its vascular risk factors. We take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on neighborhood effects on ADRD. From 1986 to 1998, the Danish government actively dispersed roughly 76,000 incoming refugees across the country in a nearly randomized (“quasi-random”) fashion to avoid over-crowding in major cities. This cohort includes nearly 12,000 individuals who lived until at least age 60 in Denmark during the 30-year follow-up. Over 90% of families agreed to participate in the program, creating a natural experiment in which these individuals were quasi-randomly assigned to neighborhoods with different levels of deprivation. We will employ unique data spanning over 30 years from Denmark's population and clinical registers, which provide data on sociodemographics, clinical encounters, and prescriptions for all Danish residents. We identify cases of ADRD and its vascular risk factors among this racially diverse cohort via validated techniques using ICD codes and prescription data in clinical registers. We have successfully linked these registers to detailed geocoded data sources on eight measures of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation. In Aim 1, our goal is to test the hypothesis that neighborhood deprivation increases the incidence of ADRD later in life. In Aim 2, we will examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on vascular risk factors for ADRD, including highly prevalent conditions that occur across the life course. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of ADRD and vascular risk factors differs in response to neighborhood deprivation, taking advantage of the large sample size and complete register data available on all subjects. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of neighborhood characteristics on ADRD and vascular risk factors, overcoming the methodological challenges in previous work. This will directly inform the development of clinical, community, and policy strategies to address the neighborhood determinants of ADRD among vulnerable populations who are most at-risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on Alzheimer's dementia and its vascular risk factors. We will examine the association of specific neighborhood characteristics with Alzheimer's and its risk factors, and we will assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to neighborhood deprivation. This will inform the development of interventions to address the neighborhood factors that affect Alzheimer's disease.",Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors,10134187,R01AG063385,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Attention', 'Biological Factors', 'Birth', 'Blood Vessels', 'Characteristics', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Denmark', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discrimination', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Immigrant', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life Experience', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Minority Groups', 'Natural experiment', 'Neighborhoods', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Refugees', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Social Sciences', 'Socialization', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Violence', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinical encounter', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'dementia risk', 'deprivation', 'diabetes risk', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protective factors', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'residence', 'response', 'social', 'social factors', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomics', 'stressor', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'treatment effect', 'vascular risk factor', 'young adult']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,532141,685608202
"Clinical Biomechanics of Hip Fracture Over 300,000 hip fractures occur each year in the U.S. and up to 25% of hip-fracture patients die within a year of their injury. Despite the importance of this clinical problem, the diagnostic screening rate for osteoporosis is only 5% of the eligible population, and the sensitivity of measuring bone mineral density (BMD) by DXA, the clinical standard test for diagnosis, is only 50%. Therefore, most patients are not being screened diagnostically for osteoporosis, and for those who are, about half who will experience a hip fracture are missed. Given that the current empirical approach is inadequate, we propose to pursue a more mechanistic approach, combining state-of-the-art biomechanics and machine learning approaches. Biomechanically, the three etiological elements of hip fracture are fall risk, femoral strength, and femoral impact force. In this project, our overall goal is to provide a deeper understanding of how all three biomechanical etiological elements interact in the event of a hip fracture and from that, directly improve clinical fracture risk assessment through the use of a single predictive “Integral Biomechanical Risk (IBR)” parameter. In addition, we will also address the problem of low DXA screening rates by further developing our Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT) technology. This test estimates the breaking strength of the femur using finite element analysis of routine clinical CT scans previously acquired for any medical reason, and represents an improvement compared to the use of BMD alone. Since millions of patients are scanned with CT each year, this approach could double screening rates if offered as an alternative to DXA. The proposed study will investigate this biomechanical approach in a large incident hip fracture, case-cohort study (3,000 patients with hip fracture, 6,000 without). This retrospective study will include patients seen at Kaiser Permanente who had an abdominal CT scan as part of medical care prior to any hip fracture; and have standard geriatric measurements in their electronic medical records, which we will use to estimate fall risk. Specifically, our aims are to: 1) utilize electronic medical record data and CT scans to obtain patient-specific measurements related to fall risk, femoral strength, and fall severity, and 2) combine the different elements of hip fracture etiology into the IBR parameter to test the hypothesis that this metric predicts hip fracture independent of age, sex, BMI, race/ethnicity, and history of prior fracture and improves hip fracture prediction compared to the clinical standard (BMD with FRAX). Scientifically, a major novelty of this work is its use of contemporary machine learning algorithms to inform construction of a mechanistic model of the three etiological elements of hip fracture, which should better capture any interactions between these elements compared to a purely statistical-regression approach. In addition, the study cohort will be the largest and most diverse CT-based hip fracture cohort ever assembled. Importantly, positive results from this project would provide a compelling “second front” to DXA that could be quickly translated to widespread clinical practice, profoundly impacting osteoporosis care. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE More than half of individuals who experience hip fracture do not have osteoporosis as assessed by DXA. This project draws together the latest technological advances in CT-based finite element modeling and combines it into a probabilistic model of fracture risk that uses as inputs, data typically available in medical records. By going beyond BMD, the fracture risk prediction tool developed by this work aims to significantly improve clinical fracture risk assessment and substantially impact the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.",Clinical Biomechanics of Hip Fracture,10144396,R01AR074958,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Biomechanics', 'Blinded', 'Body mass index', 'Bone Density', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Femur', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Fracture', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hip Fractures', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intramuscular', 'Investigation', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Osteoporosis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preventive care', 'Preventive treatment', 'Probability', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abdominal CT', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'bone', 'bone strength', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'diagnostic screening', 'ductile', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'fracture risk', 'high risk', 'hip bone', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuromuscular', 'older patient', 'patient health information', 'screening', 'sex', 'soft tissue', 'standing height', 'theories', 'tool']",NIAMS,"O.

"Development of a novel method for cryopreservation of Drosophila melanogaster PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal seeks to develop a resource for the preservation of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. This insect is a foundational model organism for biological research. Over a century of work, an enormous number of fly strains harboring different mutant alleles or transgenic constructs have been generated. However, one limitation of working with flies is that there is as yet no practical method for cryopreservation of Drosophila strains. Conventional methods of vitrifying Drosophila were developed in the early 1990s and were never widely adopted due to the difficulty in performing the protocols. This is a problem from a practical perspective since all these strains need to be individually maintained in continuous culture at substantial cost and labor, and also from a scientific perspective, since in the process of continuous culture mutations can accumulate and contamination can occur, degrading the value of these resources for future experiments. A novel approach for cryopreservation of Drosophila is proposed for this R24 resource center. Isolated embryonic nuclei, rather than intact embryos, will be cryopreserved and then nuclear transplantation via microinjection will be used to create clones derived from the cryopreserved nuclei. This approach avoids the issues associated with the impermeability of embryonic membranes that have prevented the use of conventional cryopreservation approaches that have been used with other organisms. Embryonic nuclei will be cryopreserved using a naturally inspired approach. Diverse biological systems (plants, insects, etc.) survive dehydration, drought, freezing temperatures and other stresses through the use of osmolytes. On an applied level, the proposed investigation has the potential to transform preservation of Drosophila lines by 1) preserving subcellular components (specifically nuclei) as opposed to embryos; and 2) automating much of the workflow. In the long- term, the goal of this resource center is to develop a robust and scalable protocol for cryopreservation of Drosophila, thus reducing the cost and improving the quality of long-term strain maintenance. PROJECT NARRATIVE The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a very important model organism for biomedical research. The goal of this resource center is to develop effective methods of preserving fruit flies in order to lower the costs and improve the quality of stock maintenance. The approach leverages recent scientific advances to develop a new, highly automated approach for preserving fruit flies.",Development of a novel method for cryopreservation of Drosophila melanogaster,10160982,R24OD028444,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Asses', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Cryopreservation', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Droughts', 'Embryo', 'Engineering', 'Evolution', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mechanics', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microinjections', 'Molecular Biology', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Mutation', 'Neurosciences', 'Nuclear', 'Organism', 'Plants', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'biological research', 'biological systems', 'cold temperature', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'genetic technology', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'individual response', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nuclear transfer', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'tool']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R24,2021,575125,340417756
"5/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk Summary Research suggests that if we can identify individuals at-risk for these disorders early, we may be able to improve the course of illness and hopefully prevent illness onset all together. A first generation of studies suggest that the approach of identifying those at clinical high-risk (CHR), through the use of specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a promising strategy for exploring mechanisms associated with illness progression, understanding etiology, and identifying new treatment targets. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 15-20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a handful of metropolitan centers, and requires extensively trained staff. Here, we aim to lay the foundation for a new approach to CHR assessment that will increase accessibility, and positive predictive value. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis (actively tapping into psychotic disorder-specific processes, rather than to trait vulnerability signs) and relatedly, that are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize inexpensive behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening in help-seeking as well as non-help seeking populations, that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. Before this can be accomplished however, it is necessary to determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to the first-generation prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites and in Aim 1, develop a PSDS battery risk calculator based on measures that prove to be most sensitive to imminent conversion. Further, the inclusion of a help-seeking comparison group is critical for translating the PSDS calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for developing a psychotic disorder from others forms of psychopathology. In Aim 2, we will compare the sensitivity and specificity of the PSDS risk-calculator to the North American Prodromal Study (NAPLS) risk-calculator (a gold-standard first-generation tool) in the prediction of psychosis conversion over a 2 year- period. Last, in Aim 3, the study will determine if the PSDS predicts functional outcomes over the course of 2 years. Predicting diagnosis is important but being able to provide early intervention to limit the disability characteristic of psychosis is a priority. This project will answer the preliminary questions necessary for a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods, that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview- based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",5/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk,10122993,R01MH120089,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'comparison group', 'computerized', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'metropolitan', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,579032,550947887
"Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine The application of new computerized methods of data analysis to vast collections of medical, biological, and other data is emerging as a central feature of a broad vision of precision medicine (PM) in which systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) assist clinicians in treatment, diagnosis, or prognosis. The use of AI to analyze big data for clinical decision-making opens up a new domain for ELSI inquiry to address a possible future when the implications of genetics and genomics become embedded into algorithms, pervasive yet implicit and difficult to identify. Thus, an important target of inquiry is the development and developers of these algorithms. There are three distinctive features of the application of AI, and in particular machine learning (ML), to the domain of PM that create the need for ELSI inquiry. First, the process of developing ML-based systems for PM goals is technically and organizationally complex. Thus, members of development teams will likely have different expertise and assumptions about norms, responsibilities, and regulation. Second, machine learning does not solely operate through predetermined rules, and is thus difficult to hold accountable for its conclusions or reasoning. Third, designers of ML systems for PM may be subject to diverse and divergent interests and needs of multiple stakeholders, yet unaware of the associated ethical and values implications for design. These distinctive features of ML in PM could lead to difficulties in detecting misalignment of design with values, and to breakdown in responsibility for realignment. Because machine learning in the context of precision medicine is such a new phenomenon, we have very little understanding of actual practices, work processes and the specific contexts in which design decisions are made. Importantly, we have little knowledge about the influences and constraints on these decisions, and how they intersect with values and ethical principles. Although the field of machine learning for precision medicine is still in its formative stage, there is growing recognition that designers of AI systems have responsibilities to ask such questions about values and ethics. In order to ask these questions, designers must first be aware that there are values expressed by design. Yet, there are few practical options for designers to learn how to increase awareness. Our specific aims are: Aim 1 To map the current state of ML in PM by identifying and cataloging existing US-based ML in PM  projects and by exploring a range of values expressed by stakeholders about the use of ML in PM through  a combination of multi-method review, and interviews of key informants and stakeholders. Aim 2 To characterize decisions and rationales that shape ML in PM and explore whether and how  developers perceive values as part of these rationales through interviews of ML developers and site visits. Aim 3 To explore the feasibility of using design rationale as a framework for increasing awareness of the  existence of values, and multiple sources of values, in decisions about ML in PM through group-based  exercises with ML developers from academic and commercial settings. The overall goal of this project is to understand how to encourage and enable people who are developing artificial intelligence for personalized health care to be aware of values in their daily practice. We will examine actual practices and contexts in which design decisions are made for precision medicine applications, and use this information to design group-based workshop exercises to increase awareness of values.",Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine,10136061,R01HG010476,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Cataloging', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ethics', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Expert Systems', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scholarship', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Site Visit', 'Source', 'System', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical decision-making', 'computerized', 'design', 'ethical legal social implication', 'genomic data', 'informant', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'new technology', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized health care', 'precision medicine']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,579506,560644462
"Learning to Predict Delayed Cerebral Ischemia with Novel Continuous Cerebral Arterial State Index Project Summary  Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is the most devastating complication after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and has an incidence rate of 30%. Current practice relies on intermittent assessment of neurological status and daily cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) by Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) to guide medical management to prevent DCI. Only after medical management fails, is endovascular treatment (EVT) including intraarterial vasodilator infusion and/or intracranial angioplasty initiated. This reactive practice does not account for early predictors of DCI and may miss the optimal EVT window at an early stage of DCI development before symptoms or severe deviations from normal hemodynamics. The goal of this project is to develop algorithms to predict DCI and related targets at an early stage in their development. An accurate prediction of DCI will enable a more proactive strategy to prevent and treat the underlying cause of DCI.  The following three aims will be pursued towards the goal of the project: 1) Develop aSAH-specific intracranial pressure (ICP) pulse-based cerebral arterial state index; 2) Develop and validate predictive models of targets related to delayed cerebral ischemia after aSAH; 3) Conduct a prospective institution- specific adaption and validation of the developed models.  Our DCI predictive algorithms only need data available in current clinical practice hence they can be readily adopted. If validated, these algorithms will enable clinicians to monitor risk of DCI continuously and to proactively deliver appropriate treatment. The proposed prospective study of algorithm implementation and adaptation will well prepare future clinical trials to test the efficacy of algorithm-informed interventions.

"Shape up! Kids Project Summary/Abstract Of all markers of pediatric health, the most intuitive is body shape. Human and animal studies indicate that weight loss/gain correlates closely with increasing/decreasing insulin sensitivity, respectively. Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality risk than pediatric body mass index Z-score. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can quantify regional adiposity in more detail than these measures but is underutilized for many reasons including the sensitivity to children to ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments in optical technology to better describe phenotypes of pediatric body shape and its relation to metabolic risks (obesity, “failure to thrive”) and bone density and size. If successful, sophisticated obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment technology. The long term goal of the Shape Up! Kids Study is 1) to provide pediatric phenotype descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat) and bone mineral density (BMD) over a wide range of ages (5 to 18 years), weights and heights, stratified by sex, and ethnicity. Our central hypothesis is that optical estimates with shape classification of soft tissue composition and bone density better predict fracture and metabolic risk factors than anthropometry (WC, WHR, and BM) alone. The Investigators will highly leverage existing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Bone Mineral Density in Children Study. Our specific aims are: 1) Identify the unique associations of body shape to body composition and bone density indices in a pediatric population that represents the variance found in the US population, 2) Describe the precision and accuracy of optical scans to monitor change in body composition, bone density, 3) Estimate the level of association of optical scans to common health indicators including metabolic risk factors. Our exploratory aim is to investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self-assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US pediatric population, and to define how these models relate to important metabolic status indicators. The positive impact of these outcomes will be the immediate applicability to other researcher studies and clinicians using the automated tools and models developed here for 3D optical images. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of what children are at high risk of metabolic consequences of obesity. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults, and are becoming epidemic in children as well. This is relevant to the part of NIH's mission which focuses on the prevention of disease by supporting research in the diagnosis of human diseases.",Shape up!

We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative symptoms are more strongly linked to functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative symptom mechanism tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains.

"ADAPT: Autonomous Delirium Monitoring and Adaptive Prevention Project Summary Recent large-scale trials have shown no significant benefit of pharmacological interventions in delirium patients, and non-pharmacological approaches remain the cornerstone of delirium prevention. Among those strategies, minimizing patient immobility and circadian desynchrony are particularly difficult to implement, as their assessment is dependent on sporadic human observations. The overall objective of this application is to develop ADAPT, the Autonomous Delirium Monitoring and Adaptive Prevention system using novel pervasive sensing and deep learning techniques. It will autonomously quantify patients’ mobility and circadian desynchrony in terms of nightly disruptions, light intensity, and sound pressure level. This will allow for integration of these risk factors into a dynamic model for predicting delirium trajectories. It will also enable adaptive action prompts aimed at increasing patients’ mobility, reducing nightly disruptions, optimizing ambient light, and reducing noise, based on precise real-time quantification. The rationale is that successful application of the proposed technology would augment clinical-decision making in the fast-paced ICU environment and would promote more targeted interventions. The overall objective will be achieved by pursuing three specific aims. (1) Developing and validating an interpretable deep learning algorithm for precise and dynamic prediction of the delirium trajectory, to determine if it is more accurate in predicting delirium trajectory transitions compared to existing tools, while providing interpretable information to the physician. (2) Developing a pervasive sensing system for autonomous monitoring of mobility and circadian desynchrony, to determine if it can provide accurate assessments compared to human expert and circadian biomarkers, and if it can enrich delirium trajectory prediction when combined with clinical data. (3) Developing and evaluating prompts for adaptive delirium prevention using real-time monitoring system, to determine if the system has acceptable satisfaction and perceived benefit among ICU physicians. The approach is innovative, because it represents the first attempt to (1) dynamically predict precise delirium trajectory, (2) autonomously monitor mobility and circadian desynchrony risk factors in the ICU, and (3) implement adaptive preventions in real time. The proposed research is significant since it will address several key problems and critical barriers in critical care, including (1) lack of precise and real-time delirium trajectory prediction models, (2) uncaptured aspects of mobility and circadian desynchrony, and (3) the need for novel approaches for non-pharmacological prevention. Ultimately, the results are expected to improve patient outcomes and decrease hospitalization costs, as well as lifelong complications. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it can result in enhanced critical care workflow and early critical care intervention, ultimately improving patient outcomes and decreasing hospitalization costs. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to advancing disease diagnosis through medical applications of new tools and technologies, as the proposed research applies advanced computational methods and sensing technologies to automatically quantify and convey patient status in real-time.",ADAPT: Autonomous Delirium Monitoring and Adaptive Prevention,10178157,R01NS120924,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Circadian Dysregulation', 'Circadian desynchrony', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collaborations', 'Coma', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Delirium', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Hospital Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intelligence', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Light', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurology', 'Noise', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'brain dysfunction', 'circadian', 'circadian regulation', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'light intensity', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient mobility', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'real time monitoring', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'sound', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2021,612618,188894159
"Predicting Relapse at the Time of Diagnosis in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia PROJECT SUMMARY  Relapse is the major cause of cancer related mortality in children with leukemia. Despite improvements in overall survival for children with B-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), for the 600 patients who will relapse each year, half will die of their disease. The high mortality of patients who relapse underscores the need for improved risk prediction and treatment strategies to prevent recurrent leukemia. Current approaches to relapse prediction are limited by insufficient accuracy, delayed prediction and the inability to make actionable treatment adjustments based on prediction information. To address these limitations, we applied a single-cell, high-parameter proteomic approach to ALL patient samples at the time of diagnosis, accurately predicting future relapse based on the presence of pre-B cells with activated signaling. This approach was 38% more accurate than standard of care relapse prediction methods. We propose that identifying relapse-predictive cells in ALL at the time of diagnosis using their distinguishing proteomic and genetic features will result in a clinical risk prediction model that is accurate, immediate, and actionable. This approach to relapse prediction will change the clinical paradigm of relapse risk in ALL to reduce the incidence of relapse itself.  Using large multi-institutional, multimodal cohorts of molecularly and clinically annotated diagnostic patient samples, we will apply deep proteomic approaches to identify surface proteins uniquely expressed on relapse predictive pre-B cells enabling direct identification in a diagnosis sample. We will determine how genomic mutations associate with the presence of relapse predictive cells and examine their genomic mutational burden using single-cell exome sequencing. Finally, building on our data-driven, machine learning approaches, we will construct a diagnostic relapse predictor that is more accurate than standard of care models while informing on leukemia biology and targeted therapeutic options for patients at risk. This will enable a more precise approach to patient classification and treatment, reducing the number of children facing relapse and moving closer to precision medicine for children with ALL. PROJECT NARRATIVE Relapse remains a leading cause of death for patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Using single- cell studies of primary diagnosis samples from patients, we can identify cells responsible for future relapse at the time of diagnosis. Building a model of relapse risk prediction based on the presence of these cells will enable rapid, accurate, and actionable relapse prediction moving closer to the goal of preventing relapse.",Predicting Relapse at the Time of Diagnosis in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,10210902,R01CA251858,"['Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biology', 'CREB1 gene', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Relapse', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SYK gene', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Surface', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'differential expression', 'exome sequencing', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'leukemia', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'mutational status', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'prototype', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'standard of care', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment strategy']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,615576,560644462
"Myocardial Radiomics and Mechanics in the Pathology and Prognosis of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Though knowledge advances have been made in identification and treatment of risk factors, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in the U.S., and has been worldwide for the past 15 years. The mechanisms of three leading sources of CVD morbidity, ischemic coronary artery disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation, appear rooted in myocardial pathophysiology of the left ventricle (LV), suggesting that deeper phenotyping of the LV may provide insight into the diseases. The detection of earliest forms of LV dysfunction has been challenging: traditional measures of LV structure and function associated with poor outcomes, such as mass and ejection fraction, reflect advanced stages of disease. However, recent advances in quantitative imaging of the LV myocardium using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) images may bridge this gap. Myocardial texture analysis is a type of ‘radiomics’, the computation of myocardial pixel intensity and patterns, which has shown the ability to differentiate pathological patterns in LV hypertrophy. Additionally, analysis of myocardial mechanics including strain and torsion have shown prognostic value in evaluation of cardiomyopathies. Thus, increasing evidence indicates roles for these technological advances in imaging analysis to evaluate pathological LV remodeling in subclinical cardiovascular disease in the general population. We hypothesize that application of these novel imaging analytics, correlated with biology, subclinical disease phenotyping, and outcomes, will enable more granular insight into subclinical LV structural and functional changes predating overt CVD and its forms. The Framingham and Jackson Heart Studies, community-based cohorts of whites and African Americans with longitudinal follow up, offer the opportunity to gain insight in CVD development through integration of advanced secondary imaging analysis with detailed and broad phenotyping and genotyping, and clinical end-points. Thus, the objectives of our proposal are threefold: 1) to first identify myocardial texture analysis and mechanics patterns associated with prevalent CVD and risk factors, 2) to define the biological and genetic underpinnings of these phenotypes, and 3) to understand their inter-association between structure and function, and their joint relations with long-term prognosis. Execution of our Aims will elucidate novel patterns, determinants, and prognosis of underlying early and progressive myocardial remodeling and dysfunction in CVD in a large bi-racial cohort. Ultimately, our goal is for knowledge gained from this study to advance phenotyping of LV remodeling groups, methods of cardiovascular risk stratification, and development of therapies for patient care. NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of mortality in the U.S., but its multi-factorial mechanisms and early detection are not well established. Applying new analyses of cardiovascular magnetic resonance images and integrating these measures with broad existing data including risk factors, genetics, and blood biomarkers, we will obtain deeper understanding of structure and function of the heart in older aged white and African American adults. Ultimately, accomplishment of this project will facilitate new strategies towards cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment.",Myocardial Radiomics and Mechanics in the Pathology and Prognosis of Cardiovascular Disease,10099409,R01HL155717,"['Adult', 'African American', 'Aging', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemosensitization', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Deltastab', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dilated Cardiomyopathy', 'Disease', 'EFRAC', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'High Prevalence', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Hypertrophy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left Ventricular Remodeling', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Myocardium', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Race', 'Radiogenomics', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Texture', 'Torsion', 'Ventricular Remodeling', 'Woman', 'advanced disease', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'caucasian American', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'heart function', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'ischemic cardiomyopathy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'polygenic risk score', 'preservation', 'prognostic value', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'therapy development', 'treatment risk', 'trend', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,639525,135941803
"Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia Abstract Schizophrenia constitutes a chronic and disabling illness. While patients show high rates of response to treatment after a ﬁrst-episode of schizophrenia, the long-term course of the illness is typically characterized by frequent re- lapses, persistence of symptoms, and enduring cognitive and functional deﬁcits. Despite the prioritization of relapse prevention as a treatment goal, about four out of ﬁve patients experience a relapse within the ﬁrst ﬁve years of treatment. Relapses are known to have serious psychosocial, educational, or vocational implications in young adults—a population at high risk of psychosis. However, current psychiatric ability to recognize indicators of relapse in order to prevent escalation of psychotic symptoms is markedly limited. Challenges stem from a lack of availability of comprehensive information about early warning signs, and reliance on ﬁxed time point sampling of cross-sectional data as well as patient or family reported observations, that is subject to recall bias, or on clin- ician sought information, that needs frequent and timely contact. The present proposal seeks to address these gaps in early psychosis treatment, by leveraging patient-generated and patient-volunteered social media data, and developing and validating machine learning approaches for “digital phenotyping” and relapse prediction. Our proposed work is founded on the observation that social media sites have emerged as prominent platforms of emotional and linguistic expression—young adults are among the heaviest users of social media. The work signif- icantly advances the research agenda and extensive pilot investigations of the team, who a) have demonstrated that social media data of individuals can serve as a powerful “lens” toward understanding and inferring mental health state, illness course, and likelihood of relapse, including among young adults with early psychosis; and b) have been involved in examining the role of emergent technologies, like social media, in improving access to and delivery of psychiatric care. Aim 1 will provide theoretically-grounded and clinically meaningful methods for extracting and modeling digital phenotypes and symptoms from social media data of young adult early psychosis patients. Then in Aim 2, we will develop and evaluate machine learning methods that will utilize the extracted social media digital phenotypes to infer patient-speciﬁc personalized risk of relapse, and identify its antecedents. Finally, Aim 3 will develop a two-faceted validation framework, to assess the statistical and clinical efﬁcacy and utility of the social media derived inferences of psychosis and relapse in inﬂuencing clinical outcomes and in facilitating evidence-based treatment. To accomplish these aims, the project brings together a strong multidisci- plinary team, combining expertise in social media analytics, psychiatry, psychology, natural language analysis, machine learning, information privacy, and research ethics. Our novel approach offers unprecedented opportuni- ties to initiate the adoption of personalized, responsive, and preemptive evidence-based strategies in treatment of psychosis. The knowledge will set the stage for future research on launching large-scale trials aimed to develop interventions that diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether. Project Narrative Timely monitoring of symptoms and preventing relapse after an initial psychotic episode are essential component of early intervention programs and have a critical impact on long term outcome in individuals with psychotic dis- orders. Employing patient-contributed social media data as a viable source of collateral information, this proposal provides a suite of robust, scalable, and ﬁeld evaluated machine learning methods to facilitate early and precise identiﬁcation of digital phenotypes, symptomatic exacerbation, and risk of psychotic relapse in early psychosis patients. The knowledge would provide the necessary opportunity to initiate personalized, adaptive, and proac- tive illness management strategies, inform better nosology, and assist the adoption of improved evidence-based care approaches to diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether.",Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia,10119327,R01MH117172,"['Address', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Technique', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disorientation', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Psychology', 'Source', 'Stigmatization', 'Strategic Planning', 'Suicide', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'biological research', 'biomarker development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'computational basis', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital media', 'digital models', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'family burden', 'first episode schizophrenia', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'intervention program', 'lens', 'machine learning method', 'medical complication', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'peer', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relapse patients', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'social', 'social media', 'social observations', 'stem', 'support tools', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'volunteer', 'willingness', 'young adult']",NIMH,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,641065,45341731
"Early detection, containment, and management of COVID-19 in dialysis facilities using multi-modal data sources Abstract With older age and multiple comorbidities, dialysis patients are at high risk for serious complications, even death, from COVID-19. There is a large disproportionate representation of minorities, especially Blacks and Hispanics. Over 85% of hemodialysis patients travel three times a week to dialysis facilities to receive life-sustaining treatments and cannot shelter in place. There is a critical need to characterize COVID-19 transmission pathways in dialysis patients and clinics, identify potential coronavirus carriers, and develop procedures to curb the spread. With regular medical encounters, a large amount of data has been collected for each patient over time. These data have not been fully utilized for COVID-19 prediction and control in dialysis clinics. In this proposal, we seek to leverage demographic, clinical, treatment, laboratory, socioeconomic, serological, metabolomic, wearable and machine-integrated sensors, and COVID-19 surveillance data to develop mathematical and statistical models and implement them in a large number of dialysis clinics. The mathematical and statistical modeling using multiple data resources will help us understand how COVID-19 spread in dialysis facilities, identify potential COVID-19 patients before symptoms appear, and identify potential asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. We will develop novel mathematical and statistical models that fully utilize the high dimensional multimodal data available to us and other dialysis providers. We capitalize on the intrinsic advantages of hemodialysis clinics to implement and validate the proposed prediction models. We firmly believe that this cross-disciplinary effort will improve patients’ and staff’s safety while delivering high-quality, individualized care to a high-risk population.

"A computer vision toolbox for computational analysis of nonverbal social communication PROJECT SUMMARY We will develop novel computer vision tools to reliably and precisely measure nonverbal social communication through quantifying communicative facial and bodily expressions. Our tools will be designed and developed in order to maximize their usability by non-engineer behavioral scientists, filling the enormous gap between engineering advances and their clinical accessibility. Significance: Social interaction inherently relies on perception and production of coordinated face and body expressions. Indeed, atypical face and body movements are observed in many disorders, impacting social interaction and communication. Traditional systems for quantifying nonverbal communication (e.g., FACS, BAP) require extensive training and coding time. Their tedious coding requirements drastically limits their scalability and reproducibility. While an extensive literature exists on advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques for face and body analysis, there is no well-established method commonly used in mental health community to quantify production of facial and bodily expressions or efficiently capture individual differences in nonverbal communication in general. As a part of this proposal, we will develop a computer vision toolbox including tools that are both highly granular and highly scalable, to allow for measurement of complex social behavior in large and heterogeneous populations. Approach: Our team will develop tools that provide granular metrics of nonverbal social behavior, including localized face and body kinematics, characteristics of elicited expressions, and imitation performance. Our tools will facilitate measurement of social communication both within a person and between people, to allow for assessment of individual social communication cues as well as those that occur within bidirectional social contexts. Preliminary Data: We have developed and applied novel computer vision tools to assess: (1) diversity of mouth motion during conversational speech (effect size d=1.0 in differentiating young adults with and without autism during a brief natural conversation), (2) interpersonal facial coordination (91% accuracy in classifying autism diagnosis in young adults during a brief natural conversation, replicated in an independent child sample), and (3) body action imitation (85% accuracy in classifying autism diagnosis based on body imitation performance). As apart of current proposal, we will develop more generic methods that can be used in normative and clinical samples. Aims. In Aim 1, we will develop tools to automatically quantify fine-grained face movements and their coordination during facial expression production; in Aim 2, we will develop tools to quantify body joint kinematics and their coordination during bodily expression production; in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the tools’ ability to yield dimensional metrics using machine learning. Impact: Our approach is designed for fast and rigorous assessment of nonverbal social communication, providing a scalable solution to measure individual variability, within a dimensional and transdiagnostic framework. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project develops novel tools for measuring nonverbal social communication as manifested through facial and bodily expressions. Using advanced computer vision and machine learning methodologies, we will quantify humans’ communicative social behavior. The results of this project will impact public health by facilitating a rich characterization of normative development of social functioning, providing access to precise phenotypic information for neuroscience and genetics studies, and by measuring subtle individual differences to determine whether some interventions or treatments work better than others.",A computer vision toolbox for computational analysis of nonverbal social communication,10150095,R01MH122599,"['Adolescent', 'Age', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Community Health', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Educational Materials', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grain', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Development', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral health', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'novel', 'open source', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'tool', 'usability', 'young adult']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2021,660945,178185562
"Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly (SPEEDe) ABSTRACT Adverse events (AEs) – harm to patients that results from medical care – affect as many as 13.5% of hospitalized patients; half of these AEs are preventable and AEs particularly affect the elderly. AEs are notoriously difficult to measure accurately. A variety of paper and electronic trigger tools have been developed to identify AEs; however, their positive predictive value (PPV) is low, requiting subsequent, time-intensive manual chart review to accurately measure AEs. In the proposed project, we will use innovative, state-of-the-art machine interactive learning (IML) techniques to refine existing AE triggers, improving their accuracy substantially. We will also develop a novel AE Explorer to speed review of possible AEs, as well as an innovative package of predictive analytics tools and methods to measure and detect them. Our approach combines and compares expert-driven improvement with the most recent IML techniques to make triggers more accurate, with the ultimate goal of creating triggers that are accurate enough to stand in as proxies for actual measurement of harm. We call our approach Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly, or SPEEDe. Our team of accomplished machine learning, patient safety, risk management, AE detection, geriatric medicine and trigger tool experts will work together to carry out the specific aims of this project: (1) prototype and rapidly iterate a trigger review dashboard (the Adverse Event Explorer) using a user-centered design process, (2) develop and evaluate novel Interactive Machine Learning approaches for more efficient and accurate adverse event chart review and trigger refinement, and (3) Integrate Interactive Machine Learning into the Adverse Event Explorer and evaluate it prospectively in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse events – harm to patients that results from medical care – are common and difficult to identify and measure using existing tools. Accurate real-time measures of adverse events would enable organizations to track harm over time, identify and prioritize areas for safety improvements, evaluate whether patient safety programs are effective, and communicate risks of harm to patients and caregivers.

"Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering myocardial infarction (heart attacks) have no premonitory symptoms. Studies of patients with coronary artery disease have traditionally focused only on the severity of narrowing (stenosis) of the coronary arteries by atherosclerotic plaques, rather than the adverse features of coronary plaques which are predisposed to rupture and precipitate myocardial infarction. Coronary CT Angiography (CTA) is a noninvasive test that allows assessment of both coronary stenosis and plaque characteristics. Currently, however, CTA is interpreted visually for stenosis. Quantitative measurements of CTA stenosis severity and plaque features are not part of current clinical routine.  We propose to develop novel image processing algorithms for fully automated, robust quantification of coronary plaque features from CTA. We also propose to automatically quantify the characteristics of adipose tissue around the coronary arteries (pericoronary adipose tissue, PCAT), which have been shown to differentiate rupture-prone, high-risk coronary plaques from stable ones. We propose to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine stenosis, plaque and PCAT features, along with patient clinical data, into a new integrated risk score for the prediction of future adverse cardiovascular events. We will evaluate this risk score in the real-world, prospective, landmark SCOT-HEART trial (including all 2073 patients in the CTA arm of the trial), with added external validation in large multicenter patient registries, with available CTA scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiovascular events (fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death in a grand total of 7844 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To refine, expand and automate measurements of coronary plaque and lumen for the entire coronary artery tree, and to standardize measurement of plaque changes in serial CTA; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified plaque features and PCAT characteristics for the prediction of future MACE in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries; 3) To develop and evaluate with full external validation a new automated patient risk score—combining patient clinical data, CTA-measured quantitative plaque features and PCAT characteristics, using machine learning—for the prediction of future MACE events in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries.  The proposed work will enable automated, multi-faceted and reproducible analysis of plaque, stenosis and PCAT from CTA, combined with objective risk scores reflecting likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events. This work will provide a novel, personalized, real-world paradigm that objectively and accurately identifies individual patients at risk of future cardiovascular events, from routine CTA imaging. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) In patients who are at risk of developing a heart attack, imaging of the heart with coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) allows doctors to noninvasively assess the narrowing of the coronary arteries caused by coronary plaque deposits, as well as the coronary plaques themselves. The researchers propose to develop and validate novel computerized scores derived from real-world CTA and clinical patient data using artificial intelligence, that will automatically identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack or cardiovascular death. This new research will allow physicians to more precisely identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to reduce their risk of future adverse cardiovascular events.",Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography,10165813,R01HL148787,"['Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Event', 'Future', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'arm', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinically significant', 'computerized', 'coronary calcium scoring', 'coronary computed tomography angiography', 'coronary event', 'coronary plaque', 'density', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient registry', 'prognostic significance', 'prognostic value', 'prospective']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,684863,90419233
"Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Efforts to include behavioral measures in large-scale studies as envisioned by precision medicine are hampered by the time and expertise required. Paper-and-pencil tests currently dominating clinical assessment and neuropsychological testing are plainly unfeasible. The NIH Toolbox contains many computerized tests and clinical assessment tools varying in feasibility. Unique in the Toolbox is the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB), which contains 14 tests that take one hour to administer. CNB has been validated with functional neuroimaging and in multiple normative and clinical populations across the lifespan worldwide, and is freely available for research. Clinical assessment tools are usually devoted to specific disorders, and scales vary in their concentration on symptoms that are disorder specific. We have developed a broad assessment tool (GOASSESS), which currently takes about one hour to administer. These instruments were constructed, optimized and validated with classical psychometric test theory (CTT), and are efficient as CTT allows. However, genomic studies require even more time-efficient tools that can be applied massively.  Novel approaches, based on item response theory (IRT) can vastly enhance efficiency of testing and clinical assessment. IRT shifts the emphasis from the test to the items composing it by estimating item parameters such as “difficulty” and “discrimination” within ranges of general trait levels. IRT helps shorten the length of administration without compromising data quality, and for many domains leads to computer adaptive testing (CAT) that further optimizes tests to individual abilities. We propose to develop and validate adaptive versions of the CNB and GOASSESS, resulting in a neurocognitive and clinical screener that, using machine learning tools, will be continually optimized, becoming shorter and more precise as it is deployed. The tool will be in the Toolbox available in the public domain. We have item-level information to perform IRT analyses on existing data and use this information to develop CAT implementations and generate item pools for adaptive testing. Our Specific Aims are: 1. Use available itemwise data on the Penn CNB and the GOASSESS and add new tests and items to generate item pools for extending scope while abbreviating tests using IRT-CAT and other methods. The current item pool will be augmented to allow large selection of items during CAT administration and add clinical items to GOASSESS. New items will be calibrated through crowdsourcing. 2. Produce a modular CAT version of a neurocognitive and clinical assessment battery that covers major RDoC domains and a full range of psychiatric symptoms. We have implemented this procedure on some CNB tests and clinical scales and will apply similar procedures to remaining and new tests as appropriate. 3. Validate the CAT version in 100 individuals with psychosis spectrum disorders (PS), 100 with depression/anxiety disorders (DA), and 100 healthy controls (HC). We will use this dataset to implement and test data mining algorithms that optimize prediction of specific outcomes. All tests, algorithms and normative data will be in the toolbox. Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Narrative Large scale genomic studies are done in the context of precision medicine, and for this effort to benefit neuropsychiatric disorders such studies should include behavioral measures of clinical symptoms and neurocognitive performance. Current tools are based on classical psychometric theory, and we propose to apply novel approaches of item response theory to develop a time-efficient adaptive tool for assessing broad neurocognitive functioning and psychopathology. The tool will be available in the public domain (NIH Toolbox) and will facilitate incorporation of psychiatric disorders into the precision medicine initiative.",Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan,10112310,R01MH117014,"['Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Assessment Tool', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Compromising', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Genomics', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention Studies', 'Length', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'PhenX Toolkit', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Preparation', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive performance', 'computerized', 'crowdsourcing', 'data mining', 'data quality', 'digital', 'genomic variation', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'instrument', 'male', 'mobile computing', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'protective factors', 'psychiatric symptom', 'response', 'symptom cluster', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'validation studies']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,693835,593605914
"Risk Factors for Psychosis and Mania with Prescription Amphetamine Use ABSTRACT: The use of prescription amphetamines for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has markedly increased in the last fifteen years, with the greatest increase in adolescents and young adults. In 2007, the FDA mandated changes to stimulant labels to warn of increases in psychosis and mania in patients without pre-existing conditions. Our multidisciplinary research team from Brigham and Women's Hospital and McLean Hospital recently published a landmark cohort study demonstrating an increased risk of psychotic episodes in new users of amphetamine compared to methylphenidate in adolescents and young adults with ADHD. Alarmingly, the use of amphetamines increased four-fold over the study period (2004 – 2015). In addition, our data show that prescription amphetamine use has dramatically increased in patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder. Thus, there is an urgent need to accelerate knowledge about prescriber-level factors, patient-level factors and disease states that potentiate the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription amphetamines. Large-scale studies using real-world data are the only option to study the risk of infrequent and serious adverse outcomes. In Aim 1, using incident-user cohort study designs, we will utilize data from two national administrative claims databases to identify prescriber dosing strategies that increase the risk of first-episode psychosis in ~220,000 adolescents and adults with ADHD initiating amphetamines. We hypothesize that there will be a dose-dependent increase in the risk of psychosis. The goal of Aim 2 is to identify patient subgroups at heightened risk of psychosis/mania with prescription amphetamine use. To accomplish this goal, we will perform a case control study using electronic medical records (EMR) from McLean Hospital in ~1,650 patients hospitalized for an initial episode of psychosis or mania compared to ~3,300 controls with a first psychiatric hospitalization for reasons other than psychosis or mania. We will apply natural language processing to unstructured narrative notes to capture detailed patient data not available in claims data. We hypothesize that patients with a family history of psychiatric illness will have an increased risk of psychosis/mania with amphetamines compared to patients without a family history. We also hypothesize that patients with concurrent cannabis use will have an increased risk of psychosis/mania with amphetamines compared to patients without cannabis use. Aim 3 compares the risk of treatment-emergent mania in ~52,000 new users of amphetamine versus methylphenidate in a cohort study of patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder, an urgent issue given the known risk of mania with stimulant use. Combined, these studies will provide actionable evidence to be incorporated into clinical practice guidelines with the goal of mitigating the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription stimulants. The proposed research agenda aligns with NIMH Strategic Objective 3.3 “Striving for Prevention and Cure” on testing interventions in real-world practice settings to evaluate the impact of patient- and provider-level factors on clinical outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE: In recent years, 6.1 million U.S. children and adolescents were diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 16 million adults reported past-year use of prescription stimulants. The research team recently found an increased risk of psychosis in new users of prescription amphetamines compared to new users of prescription methylphenidate in adolescents and young adults with ADHD, translating to potentially increased risk of psychosis for thousands of U.S. patients. Therefore, identifying patient subgroups and prescribing practices that increase the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription amphetamines has enormous public health significance and will guide providers to avoid amphetamines in patients at highest risk, preventing future cases of psychosis and mania.",Risk Factors for Psychosis and Mania with Prescription Amphetamine Use,10188647,R01MH122427,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amphetamine Users', 'Amphetamines', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Big Data', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Boston', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Practice Patterns', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'First Degree Relative', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immigration', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Manic', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Modification', 'Mood stabilizers', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Provider', 'Psychiatric Hospitals', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Ritalin', 'Sampling', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'amphetamine use', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'cost effective', 'data warehouse', 'first episode psychosis', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'marijuana use', 'patient subsets', 'practice setting', 'prevent', 'stimulant use', 'treatment risk', 'university student']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2021,694144,44711126
"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  In the U.S., trauma is the leading cause of death for those 1-45 years old and hemorrhage remains the largest contributing factor to preventable death. Providers must rapidly identify those suffering from hemorrhage to optimize outcome, but internal bleeding remains difficult to diagnose even for experienced clinicians. Little is known on presentation about those suffering from occult hemorrhage and providers must quickly make treatment decisions in these time-pressured, time-sensitive clinical scenarios. This proposal seeks to develop through artificial intelligence, a type of advanced machine learning, prediction algorithms that could be deployed at the bedside of patients to assist clinicians with more timely recognition of hemorrhage. By doing so, we hypothesize that this approach (integrating diverse data sources that have not previously been combined to one another) could identify patterns in our patients that far surpass current capabilities to quickly detect and act on the critical components contributing to outcome. The ability to rapidly pinpoint these patterns and display them to the bedside clinician could allow more timely intervention and precise therapeutic approaches for hemorrhage control.  Beyond the challenges in rapidly identifying bleeding, current treatment of hemorrhage is rudimentary with a standard resuscitation approach for all patients. This reflects attempts to optimize outcome based upon the average treatment effect, rather than being adaptable for unique patient phenotypes. Hemorrhage is believed to initiate a complex chain of events involving crosstalk between the coagulation and inflammatory systems that are hypothesized to play a key role in outcome. Trauma has a known time zero of onset, making it an ideal model to study the immediate pathophysiologic changes associated with hemorrhage. This complex, individual patient biology is believed to explain why those suffering similar injury have differing outcomes. However, to date, these individual characteristics are poorly understood and not factored into initial treatment approaches. Through this proposal, I also seek to define novel digital biomarkers representing patient phenotypes that require precision resuscitation approaches to maximize outcome. Fundamental to reducing hemorrhagic deaths is the need to elucidate a deeper understanding of these mechanistic models of patient states. Strategies that help to identify novel patient phenotypes that could benefit from more tailored treatment pathways may provide important advances in decreasing preventable death.  The net result of this proposal will be a deeper insight into the mechanistic models contributing to evolving patient states following hemorrhage, and identify the key phenotypes or digital biomarkers associated with mortality, complications, and occult hemorrhage. Finding solutions to advance our resuscitation approaches following hemorrhage has potential to decrease complications, save lives, and reduce health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the US, traumatic injury is the number one cause of death for those under 45 years old and these deaths include many patients dying from the consequences of bleeding. Through leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (a scientific analysis approach similarly used in non-medical fields to help answer questions from large amounts of complex information), an integrated approach to measuring outcome will be developed utilizing biologic, clinical, and electronic medical record (EMR) data. The goal of this project is to lay the ground work for developing early warning detection systems that could identify those at risk of complications early and assist care providers in selecting the best treatment to minimize complications and death from hemorrhage.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation,10063555,R01HL149670,"['Abdomen', 'Abdominal Cavity', 'Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bedside Technology', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Provider', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Triage', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'detection platform', 'digital', 'diverse data', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'point of care', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'preventable death', 'profiles in patients', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'severe injury', 'treatment effect']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,695258,254622553
"Radiomics and Pathomics to predict upstaging of DCIS Abstract  Ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) of the breast are a heterogeneous group of neoplastic lesions that are usually detected by screening mammography. Workup generally includes a percutaneous (core) Biopsy (Bx) for histologic confirmation, followed by multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), followed by breast-conserving excision, and adjuvant radiation. Approximately 20-25% of patients with core Bx-confirmed DCIS are upstaged to invasive carcinoma upon pathology of resected tissue. Foreknowledge of this would dictate a more aggressive surgical intervention, including sentinel node biopsy for axillary staging. Further, another 20-25% of patients are judged to have low-risk disease and current thought is that such women may have better outcomes in an active surveillance setting, and this is being tested in clinical trials. The ultimate goal and the overall impact of this project is to use machine learning to identify biochemical (SA1) or imaging (SA2) biomarkers, as well as their combination (SA3) to discriminate indolent from aggressive DCIS, as determined by upstaging upon excisional biopsy.  The major hypothesis to be tested in this work is that hypoxia and expression of hypoxia-related proteins (HRPs) can discriminate aggressive from more indolent DCIS, and that this can be used for decision support. Expression of HRPs is optimally characterized by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and we have deployed methods for multiplexed IHC, as well as methods for advanced analytics using machine learning (pathomics). We have also shown that hypoxic habitats within breast cancers can be identified from mpMRI using machine learning (radiomics). We thus propose to use pathomics of core biopsies and radiomics of mpMRI to determine the presence and extent of hypoxic habitats in DCIS prior to surgery to predict subsequent upstaging after surgical resection. This work will be performed in Aim 1 for pathomics and Aim 2 for radiomics, and Aim 3 will develop combined radio-pathomics predictors. Each aim will contain: (a) retrospective arms for training, tuning, and testing; and (b) prospective internal and external cohorts for rigorous validation. For the retrospective studies, we have identified 604 cases wherein women with DCIS obtained core Bx, mpMRI, and surgery with pathology at Moffitt in the last 10 years. Internal prospective studies will accrue ~6 women/month who have consented to the total Cancer Care® protocol and who have their complete workup at Moffitt. External validation cohorts will be accrued at UCSF and at Advent Health.  At the end of this work we will have developed a risk model for DCIS that can be deployed prior to surgery to guide decisions along the spectrum from active surveillance at one end to more extensive surgical intervention at the other. This is expected to lay a foundation for subsequent interventional trials. Additionally, the inclusion of hypoxia as a central hypothesis has high potential to illuminate components of the natural history of this disease. Narrative  Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancies of the breast and data are lacking with regard to optimal treatment. Consequently, the majority of DCIS are treated in the same manner: i.e. surgery +/- radiation +/- hormonal therapy that results in either over- or under-treatment of many patients. In the current work we will test the hypothesis that histologic or radiologic markers prior to surgery can guide decision support by identifying predicting up-staging and pathological risk scoring following surgical excision.",Radiomics and Pathomics to predict upstaging of DCIS,10120171,R01CA249016,"['Acidosis', 'Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Axilla', 'Basic Science', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Carcinogenesis', 'Carcinoma', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Paths', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consent', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Duct (organ) structure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Excision', 'Excision biopsy', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Habitats', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Histologic', 'Hyperplasia', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Indolent', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammographic screening', 'Mammography', 'Metastatic breast cancer', 'Methods', 'Milk', 'Modeling', 'Multiparametric Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radio', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Resected', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'SLC2A1 gene', 'Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'arm', 'base', 'breast malignancies', 'cancer care', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'disease natural history', 'disorder risk', 'hormone therapy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic', 'optimal treatments', 'practical application', 'preclinical study', 'premalignant', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,H.

"Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers PROJECT SUMMARY Efforts at early identification of individuals at risk for psychosis are propelled by the realization that psychosis is neurodevelopmental, with brain and behavioral abnormalities anteceding diagnosis of schizophrenia (SZ) by years. As longer duration of untreated psychosis portends poor outcome, early identification is important to bend the developmental trajectory in a favorable direction. Since most current studies of psychosis risk are based on help-seeking samples, there is a gap in knowledge on how psychosis unfolds in diverse community samples. While it is generally recognized that genomic and environmental factors (GxE) contribute to risk for psychosis, there is a paucity of complementary integrative studies that can chart causal pathways. Genomic “case-control” GWAS studies of SZ identified multiple common alleles permitting calculation of a polygenic risk score (PRS). Recently, increased attention has been given to childhood adversity related to SZ. The goal of the proposed R01 is to build on our genotyped ~10,000 Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) of 8 to 21 years old youths studied in 2009-2011, where we are following those who meet criteria or are at risk for psychosis (PS) and typically developing (TD) participants, whose current age range is 15-30 years. Available multi-level “deep phenotyping” includes clinical, neurocognition and multi-modal neuroimaging on a subsample of ~1600. We have developed a preliminary environmental risk score (ERS) and will use it to dissect GxE. The proposed followup design will recruit PS and TD participants with the highest and lowest scorers (quartile) on the ERS, and within each of these four cells we will examine 120 individuals, 60 males and 60 females (total N=480). This sample will be examined clinically, neurocognitively and with multimodal neuroimaging. We will test the hypothesis that genomic vulnerabilities, based on PRS and family history, and environmental adversity, based on ERS, updated longitudinally, affect onset and course of PS by altering brain development in temporolimbic regions affecting fronto-limbic connectivity that underlies social functioning. We will augment current data with information on risk and resilience and multimodal brain-behavior parameters to establish developmental trajectories during this critical period of brain maturation when psychosis emerges. Our aims are: 1. Examine effects of ERS on PS clinical features and progression in relation to PRS. 2. Investigate brain- behavior parameters that bridge from genetic and environmental factors to clinical manifestations. 3. Establish developmental trajectories for PS features, associated brain parameters and neurocognitive deficits, and apply novel computational models to enable an adaptive “risk and resilience calculator”. The proposed study will produce the data absent for a diverse US community sample but needed to move psychiatry into the precision medicine era. The project will inform on genomic and environmental risk and resilience indicators, offering an essential rung in the ladder toward individualized prediction, a part of implementation science. As with the PNC, data and associated algorithms will be a resource shared with the scientific community. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed R01 aims to bridge genomic, environment and phenotypic brain-behavior measures to advance the understanding of risk and resilience to psychosis. We will build on informative samples of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and integrate multidimensional behavioral measures of psychosis and cognition, multimodal neuroimaging parameters of brain structure, function and connectivity, environmental parameters, and genomic variations in risk for schizophrenia. Computational modeling will aim at developing risk and resilience predictors, essential for early identification and intervention during a dynamic period of brain maturation.",Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers,10149410,R01MH119219,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linear Regressions', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Functioning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'brain behavior', 'case control', 'childhood adversity', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'data anonymization', 'design', 'early adolescence', 'emerging adult', 'follow-up', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic variation', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'psychiatric genomics', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'sex', 'social']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,733897,593605914
"Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with approximately 100,000 adolescents and young adults in the US experiencing a first episode of psychosis (FEP) every year. Early intervention following FEP is critical for achieving improved outcomes, yet treatment of FEP is often delayed between 1 and 3 years in the US due to delays in detection and referral. The World Health Organization has advocated shortening the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) to three months or less. The goal of this study is to develop and validate a universal EHR-based screening tool for early detection of FEP across large clinical populations in diverse healthcare settings. In order to maximize the impact and generalizability of the tool across a wide range of healthcare settings, we will rely only on coded medical information collected in the course of care and thus widely available in EHRs. The tool will be developed and validated with data from three diverse health systems that cover over 8 million patients spanning a wide range of demographic, socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds: Partners Healthcare System, Boston Children's Hospital, and Boston Medical Center. The study will be conducted by a closely collaborating interdisciplinary team of clinical specialists, psychosis researchers, and risk modeling experts based at these health systems and Harvard Medical School, with extensive experience in treating psychosis patients, and developing strategies for detecting FEP and EHR-based risk screening tools for early detection of various clinical conditions. Our preliminary studies show that EHR-based risk models can be used to sensitively and specifically detect FEP cases, on average 2 years before the first psychosis diagnosis appears in their EHR. Our specific aims include: 1. Define a robust cross-site case definition for FEP that relies only on information commonly available in EHRs and validate it through expert chart review; 2. Train and validate a predictive model for early detection of FEP based on large samples of patient data from the three sites; 3. Develop and validate FEP early detection models for key subpopulations, including patients receiving care at mental health clinics, adolescent medicine outpatient programs, and substance abuse treatment programs; and 4. Engage clinical stakeholders in the process of developing a prototype clinician-facing EHR-based risk screening tool for FEP, and release it as an open source SMART App, enabling further validation and clinical integration across a wide range of healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would provide a novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tool for improving the trajectory of those affected with psychosis and reducing the burden and costs of untreated illness. Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with difficulties and delays in detecting its onset that can lead to worse clinical outcomes. The proposed research will develop a clinician-facing electronic-health-record-based automated screening tool for early detection of the first episode of psychosis, with implications for reducing the duration of untreated psychosis as recommended by the NIMH and World Health Organization.

"An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning Abstract: The next generation of health care professionals will need to understand the foundational principles of biology. Science textbooks play a critical role in supporting biological understanding in school, yet these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in today’s classrooms. By their nature, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current Life Science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with adaptable texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned inheritance (NGSS LS3A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing, developing, and testing the application to function through a web browser (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content to address 12 additional NGSS standards in English and Spanish (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive reading technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning needs. This Fast-Track project will produce an interactive, digital textbook to support students’ understanding of Life Science by giving them the ability to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages and to play games that enhance their understanding of scientific language and concepts. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students to develop teacher support materials and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning",10083748,R44GM133245,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Books', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Diagnosis', 'Education Projects', 'English Learner', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future Teacher', 'Gametogenesis', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'K-12 Education', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Middle School Student', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'STEM field', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Spinal Cord', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'concept mapping', 'design', 'digital', 'education resources', 'egg', 'eighth grade', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'learning community', 'learning engagement', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'personalized learning', 'reading ability', 'resource guides', 'response', 'science teacher', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'sperm cell', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2021,750000,981500
"Genotype First: Actionable Genetic Risk through Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction Project Summary Early disease prevention, detection, and intervention are fundamental goals for advancing human health. Meanwhile, genetic risk is, for all intents and purposes, the earliest significant contributor to common, heritable, disease risk. Thus, in theory, genetic profiling should be the ideal tool for early disease prevention. Yet, genetic factors are rarely used directly to predict future disease risk. Rather, genetic information is typically relegated to phenotype-first scenarios: providing or confirming diagnoses for individuals with overt disease or clarifying the genetic risk for individuals with a strong family history of disease. For modern genomics to make a significant impact on disease prevention the use of genomic information must transition to a genotype-first approach; prediction of genetic disease risk in otherwise healthy individuals. A major barrier to this transition includes our limited ability to predict the precise array of risks and likely phenotypic expression of disease in an individual from genetic and other risk factors. The degree of disease risk and phenotypic expression conveyed to any single individual by genetic factors is a result of a complex interplay between direct and indirect genetic effects, other unmodifiable risk factors (age, gender, ancestry, family history), and intermediate modifiable risk factors (environment, behavior, laboratory values, health status, therapy status, etc.) many of which have their own direct genetic mediators. New approaches are required to dissect this interplay in order to personalize and contextualize preventative actions that most effectively reduce overall disease risk. The overarching goal of this proposal is the development of innovative Deep learning and machine-learning approaches to integrate baseline genetic risk predictions with the measurement of traditional risk factors in order to provide more accurate and actionable predictions of disease risk. By tying genetic risk to traditional risk factors, especially modifiable risk factors, we will enable actionability by allowing both a determination of preventative actions that may be especially effective because they offset genetic risk, as well as the identification of modifiable risk factors that should be monitored and controlled proactively given increased genetic predisposition. To accomplish this goal, we propose to develop methods to: (1) infer the likely phenotypic expressivity of monogenic risk variants via a spatial covariance machine learning approach, (2) predict prevalent disease cases and the expected value of intermediate modifiable risk factors from polygenic and other unmodifiable risk factors, and finally (3) predict prevalent disease cases through interactions between baseline genetic expectations and observed (measured) intermediate modifiable risk factors in a deep learning framework. Adjusting age and modifiable risk factors in these trained models would then allow for the interactive projection of future disease risk and the identification of modifiable risk factors that, when manipulated, lead to the greatest change in future disease risk. We focus on the development of methods for coronary artery disease given its public health importance, the known utility of polygenic risk estimation, and the current evidence for polygene-by-environment interactions. In addition, the approach we propose integrates directly with current clinical decision support tools for coronary artery disease management. However, we will build a general framework that can be extended to any common heritable adult-onset condition, especially those with known heritable, traditional risk factors Project Narrative Significant investment has been placed in the identification of genetic risk factors for common diseases. Yet, outside of family history, genetic risk is almost never included in routine clinical risk assessments. The goal of this proposal is to develop deep learning methods for the integration of genetic and traditional risk factors into comprehensive disease risk prediction.",Genotype First: Actionable Genetic Risk through Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction,10245285,R01HG010881,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Onset of illness', 'Output', 'Pathogenicity', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'data standards', 'deep learning', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'expectation', 'feature extraction', 'feedforward neural network', 'genetic information', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'method development', 'modifiable risk', 'multitask', 'novel strategies', 'personalized intervention', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'theories', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'variant of unknown significance']",NHGRI,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,761822,176988430
"Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Heart Failure: A Cross Cohort Collaboration ABSTRACT Heart failure (HF), and its subtypes defined by preserved (HFpEF), reduced (HFrEF) or mid-range (HFmrEF) ejection fraction are a major and growing public health problem. The long term goal of this project is to better understand the health disparities regarding HF and define effective preventive measures that may reduce these disparities. We propose to pool data from 10 large longitudinal cohort studies to examine race/ethnic and sex disparities in developing HF, its subtypes, and its prognosis. The harmonized data will include over 130,028 men and women with over 8975 similarly-adjudicated prospective HF outcomes, representing a wide spectrum of ages, race/ethnicities, and geographic regions of the United States. This cross-cohort collaboration will provide a unique opportunity to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of sex and racial/ethnic health disparities in HF. Causal mediation analysis techniques will be used to estimate the degree to which single and multi-factor lifestyle and clinical interventions could potentially reduce health disparities in HF. In our phenomapping aim, we will define unique clinically relevant phenotypes of HF based upon cohort data that is also commonly present in medical records for enhanced generalizability, including age, race/ethnicity, sex, clinical signs, symptoms, biomarkers, ejection fraction, physiologic measures, and co-morbidities; we will also evaluate HF phenotype associations with CVD and all-cause mortality. NARRATIVE This Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Heart Failure: A Cross-Cohort Collaboration study will evaluate the magnitude and potential causes of racial/ethnic and sex disparities in incident heart failure and its subtypes and their prognosis in over 130,000 men and women from 10 pooled cohorts. We will evaluate the impact of hypothetical lifestyle and clinical risk factors interventions on reducing the racial/ethnic disparities in developing HF.

"Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods Implantable medical devices have revolutionized contemporary cardiovascular care, and are used in a wide spectrum of acute and chronic cardiovascular conditions. However, medical device design fault or incorrect use may lead to significant risk of patient injury and represents an important preventable public health risk in the United States. To help identify device-related safety issues, a strategy of active, prospective, post-market safety surveillance has been recommended by the FDA, and evaluated methodologically. This type of surveillance offers significant advantages over traditional adverse event reporting strategies. However, all such approaches are challenged by the need to incorporate learning effects into expectations regarding safety. These learning impacts been repeatedly shown to have dramatic impacts on outcomes during early device experience. Quantifying learning effects on the outcomes associated with high-risk cardiovascular devices will improve our understanding of intrinsic device performance, thereby identifying patient populations best treated with such devices while simultaneously providing necessary feedback to device manufacturers to support iterative improvement in device design. Separately, understanding the impacts of learning may identify opportunities for targeted training as well as help to tease apart institutional and operator characteristics that may accelerate the achievement of optimal outcomes in the use of the specific cardiovascular device.  This proposal seeks to extend the previously validated, open-source, active, prospective device safety surveillance tool, by developing and validating robust learning curve (LC) detection and quantification algorithms, designed to simultaneously account for the effects at the operator and institutional levels. We propose a “blinded” development strategy, in which one team will generate robust synthetic clinical data simulator with LC impacts, and the other team develops and applies LC detection and quantification algorithms, without knowledge of the underlying relationships, determine performance and accuracy through sequential refinement and validation steps. We propose to formally validate the optimized LC tools in real-world data through re-analysis of previously published LC effects on transcatheter valves and vascular closure devices using national cardiovascular registries. In addition, the LC tools will be incorporated into two active, prospective device safety surveillance studies of novel implantable cardiovascular devices using large clinical registries. This proposal seeks to understand the impact of institutional and physician learning on the safety of newly approved cardiovascular devices, and to use this knowledge to support and improve effective medical device safety surveillance. We propose a “blinded” strategy of separating simulated dataset generation from the learning effects detection and quantification algorithm development. Incorporating learning effects adjustment into a validated, prospective, near-real-time safety surveillance system, this research will improve public health by identifying poorer performing cardiovascular devices, and provide physicians, device manufacturers and public health officials with better information to optimize the use of medical devices, iteratively improve their design, and identify opportunities for enhanced training that will result in improved patient outcomes.",Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods,10088471,R01HL149948,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Device Safety', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Implant', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Medical Device Safety', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Methods', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'high risk', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'post-market', 'prospective', 'safety outcomes', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'surveillance study', 'systems research', 'tool']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,768996,377931988
"Elucidating hereditary transthyretin-mediated heart failure risk using machine learning, polygenic risk and recall by genotype approaches in African ancestry individuals PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Mutations in the Transthyretin (TTR) gene can lead to deposition of abnormal amyloid fibrils in the myocardium, resulting in hereditary transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (hATTR-CM) and leading to heart failure. Targeted therapies for hATTR-CM have recently been developed and have shown to improve mortality and hospitalization.  Recently, we led a study (Journal of American Medical Association, Dec 2019) that showed that the TTR V122I mutation, commonly observed in racial/ethnic minorities (4% in African Americans (AAs) and 1% in Hispanic Americans (HAs)), confers two-fold increased risk of heart failure. Despite this strong effect, only 11% of V122I carriers with heart failure were appropriately diagnosed with hATTR-CM, suggesting marked underdiagnosis and mis-diagnosis of the disease. We further showed subclinical evidence of echocardiographic derangements in young, asymptomatic V122I carriers, suggesting early signs can occur well before onset of disease.  We propose to extend our prior work by addressing knowledge gaps which are necessary for targeted therapies to attain their full potential. These include: understanding the incomplete penetrance of V122I; identifying V122I carriers in large health care systems where genotyping is not common; and understanding subclinical disease burden. In Aim 1, we will examine the interplay between a polygenic risk score, which are comprised of millions of single nucleotide variants with small effects, and V122I, a monogenic mutation with a single strong effect, analyzed in conjunction with clinical risk factors on heart failure in in 6,609 AAs and 9,006 HAs in the BioMe biobank and 5,833 AAs in the Penn Medicine Biobank (PMBB). In Aim 2, we will apply machine learning tools to multi-modal electronic health record (EHR) data to identify V122I carriers in ~8 million patients from an electronic health record (EHR) data repository at Mount Sinai. In Aim 3, we will evaluate subclinical effects of amyloid deposition on cardiac structural/functional traits in young, asymptomatic V122I carriers by recalling V122I carriers for imaging evaluation including research-grade echocardiograms, cardiac magnetic resonance and technetium nuclear scanning.  The proposal is innovative because we are utilizing two large diverse ancestry EHR-linked biobanks from academic health systems (BioMe at Mount Sinai, and PMBB at University of Pennsylvania), along with adopting cutting-edge methods including multi-ethnic polygenic risk scores, and machine learning approaches on multi-modal EHR data. We further propose patient recall based on genotypes and perform deep phenotyping using comprehensive heart imaging scans.  This proposal has the potential to realize the potential of precision medicine for heart failure in racial/ethnic minorities by informing clinical care, population management, risk stratification and clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Transthyretin V122I, is a highly penetrant mutation for hereditary transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (hATTR-CM) that is common in African Americans and Hispanic Americans. Recent therapies have been approved to treat hATTR-CM, which have led to decreased mortality; thus, understanding who will develop hATTR-CM, accurate identification of V122I carriers and understanding hidden disease burden is important. In this proposal, we examine the population health impact of V122I using polygenic risk scores, machine learning approaches on electronic health records, and patient recall by genotype, which can lead to new population health strategies for heart failure in racial and ethnic minorities.","Elucidating hereditary transthyretin-mediated heart failure risk using machine learning, polygenic risk and recall by genotype approaches in African ancestry individuals",10101075,R01HL155915,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'African', 'African American', 'Age', 'American Medical Association', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid Fibrils', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caribbean Hispanic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diphosphates', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Echocardiography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Onset of illness', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prealbumin', 'Quality of life', 'Recontacts', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supportive care', 'Technetium', 'Technetium 99m', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'burden of illness', 'clinical care', 'clinical risk', 'data repository', 'disease diagnosis', 'ethnic minority population', 'heart imaging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'polygenic risk score', 'population health', 'precision medicine', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'scale up', 'screening', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,770230,415711940
"Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder, affecting 2 million Americans in whom it may cause skipped heart beats, dizziness or stroke. Unfortunately, therapy for AF has limited success, likely because AF represents heterogenous and poorly characterized disease entities between individuals. A central challenge is that it is not clear why a specific therapy works in a given AF patient. This uncertainty makes it challenging to develop a patient-specific approach to tailor therapy for personalized medicine.  The premise of this project is that mechanistic data is increasingly available in AF patients at scales spanning tissue, whole heart and patient levels, yet rarely integrated. We set out to use machine learning (ML), a powerful approach proven to classify complex datasets, to integrate data to address 3 clinical unmet needs. First, electrograms are rarely used to guide therapy in AF, unlike organized rhythms, because they are difficult to interpret. Second, it is difficult to understand how arrhythmia is affected by any specific ablation strategy in AF, unlike organized rhythms. This makes it difficult to improve therapy. Third, it is difficult to identify whether an individual patient will or will not have success from AF ablation. We applied machine learning and novel objective analyses to these questions to develop strategies for personalized AF therapy.  We have 3 specific aims: (1) To identify components of AF electrograms using ML trained to monophasic action potentials (MAP); (2) To identify electrical and structural features of the acute response of AF to ablation near and remote from PVs; (3) To identify patients in whom ablation is unsuccessful or successful long-term, who are poorly separated at present. Each Aim will compare ML to traditional biostatistics, and use objective explainability analysis of ML to provide mechanistic insights.  This study has potential to deliver immediate clinical and translational impact. We will apply specific ML approaches, biostatistics, and computer modeling to our rich multiscale registry. We will develop practical and shareable tools, which we will prospectively test clinically, to deliver meaningful outcomes at tissue, whole heart and patient scales. Our team is experienced in electrophysiology, computer science, signal processing and biological physics. This project is likely to reveal novel multiscale AF phenotypes to enable personalized therapy. Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation Narrative Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an enormous public health problem that affects 2-5 million Americans, causing stroke, rapid heart beats, heart failure and even death. In this project, the applicant will apply numerical analysis and machine learning to detailed data acquired from patients undergoing therapy, to better define individual biological types of AF, which may provide a foundation for personalized patient-tailored diagnosis and therapy.",Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation,10130617,R01HL149134,"['Ablation', 'Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dizziness', 'Drug Controls', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'demographics', 'digital', 'experience', 'heart rhythm', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized strategies', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'response', 'signal processing', 'success', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'voice recognition', 'voltage']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,771584,560644462
"An interactive, digital platform to transform physical science learning Abstract: The next generation of science and health care professionals will need to understand the foundational concepts of physics. While textbooks play a critical role in science learning, these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in today’s classrooms. Unfortunately, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current physical science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with interactive texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned force and motion (NGSS PS2A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing and developing science learning games (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content in both English and Spanish to address 9 additional NGSS standards (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive learning technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning disabilities. This Fast-Track project will produce a bilingual, digital platform to support students’ understanding of Physical Science, which will allow students to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages, play science learning games, and receive personalized content. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students, develop teacher support materials, and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform physical science learning",10303076,R44GM137622,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Books', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Diagnosis', 'Drops', 'Education Projects', 'English Learner', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future Teacher', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Internet', 'K-12 Education', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Middle School Student', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'STEM field', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Scientist', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'design', 'digital', 'education resources', 'eighth grade', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'learning community', 'learning engagement', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'personalized learning', 'physical science', 'reading ability', 'response', 'science teacher', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2021,774997,981500
"Prospective sudden cardiac death risk stratification using CMR and echocardiography machine learning in mitral valve prolapse PROJECT SUMMARY Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common valvulopathy affecting over 170 million worldwide. Every year, 0.4- 1.9% of individuals with MVP will develop sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) or sudden cardiac death (SCD), and 7% of SCDs in the young are caused by MVP. However, predictors of this devastating outcome are not readily available, and indications for a primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in MVP are lacking. Severe mitral regurgitation explains only 50% of SCA cases in MVP. SCD/SCA risk has also been linked to a bileaflet phenotype with mild MR, mitral annular disjunction (MAD), and left ventricular focal fibrosis on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)-late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images. Such imaging parameters (including LGE) have not been evaluated prospectively. Moreover, they are not consistently found in SCA survivors, and diffuse fibrosis has been proposed as an alternative arrhythmic substrate by our group and others based on CMR/T1 mapping, strain echocardiography, and post-mortem data. Overall, it is challenging to pinpoint a unique imaging phenotype, and uncertainty exists about which MVP patients should undergo CMR. Regardless of arrhythmic phenotype, complex ventricular ectopy (ComVE - defined as frequent polymorphic PVCs, bigeminy or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia) is detected in 80-100% of MVP cases prior to SCA or SCD. ComVE, commonly associated with left ventricular fibrosis on CMR, is linked to higher all-cause mortality and SCA rates (20% versus 12% if no ComVE, p < 0.05) based on preliminary cross-sectional data. Our central hypothesis is that MVP patients with ComVE, because of the higher prevalence of either LGE or abnormal T1 mapping, represent ideal CMR candidates regardless of leaflet involvement or MAD, and can be rapidly identified by an automated “surveillance” tool within a large echocardiographic database. Moreover, we hypothesize that fibrosis is the strongest predictor of SCD/SCA in an unprecedented, multi-center effort to longitudinally assess clinical and CMR parameters of arrhythmic risk in MVP. Specifically, we aim to 1) Assess the role of CMR as a screening tool for fibrosis in MVP with ComVE incorporating T1 mapping in addition to LGE in an unselected MVP sample; 2) Develop an echo-based machine-learning algorithm to detect MVP with ComVE, test its association with myocardial fibrosis on CMR and longitudinal SCD/SCA risk; and 3) Build a novel prospective SCD/SCA risk prediction model in MVP. Better selection of CMR candidates and development of a SCD/SCA risk prediction tool inclusive of fibrosis by CMR are expected to dramatically improve risk stratification in MVP and establish future criteria for primary prevention ICD trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Every year, 0.4-1.9% of individuals with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) will develop sudden cardiac death or arrest. In this application we propose to better identify those at risk by using cardiac magnetic resonance and echocardiography-based artificial intelligence, with the long-term goal of selecting those that may benefit most from a defibrillator. .",Prospective sudden cardiac death risk stratification using CMR and echocardiography machine learning in mitral valve prolapse,10171903,R01HL153447,"['Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autopsy', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defibrillators', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Echocardiography', 'Fibrosis', 'Future', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Heart Arrest', 'High Prevalence', 'Holter Electrocardiography', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Implantable Defibrillators', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Mission', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency', 'Mitral Valve Prolapse', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Prevention', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Screening procedure', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'coronary fibrosis', 'cost', 'extracellular', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'prognostic significance', 'prospective', 'recurrent neural network', 'risk prediction model', 'secondary analysis', 'stem', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,779765,685608202
"Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches Project Summary  Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder, affecting every 200-1000 people, depending on the population and diagnostic criteria. FH leads to lifetime raised low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, a high risk for premature atherosclerosis and downstream coronary heart disease. FH is designated as Tier 1 disease by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, notably one of only three such diseases, because it is common, is associated with a high risk of premature illness, and is treatable with lifestyle or medications. Great uncertainty exists about the optimal approach to FH screening, which is reflected in conflicting recommendations in national screening guidelines.  We propose to synthesize high quality data from national surveys and population-based cohort studies in a health policy computer simulation model comparing the health and economic value of different FH screening strategies. This study will prioritize the optimal approaches to FH screening in the U.S. population, identifying optimal initial screening age and defining the role of genetic testing in screening.  We have assembled a team of experts in pediatric preventive cardiology, decision analysis, cardiovascular disease epidemiology, population genetics, biostatistics, health economic evaluation, and computer simulation modeling in order to evaluate and compare different FH screening strategies in children and adults. We aim to use this expertise and these methods in order to:   Quantify diagnostic yield, clinical effectiveness, and economic value of universal FH phenotype  screening in childhood or adulthood, and the added value of FH genotype screening   Compare universal FH screening to the alternatives of using family history or a Big Data-based  algorithm to direct targeted screening limited to children and adults with possible FH diagnosis   Quantify the health and economic value of cascade screening families of FH cases  We hypothesize that FH screening in childhood will be the highest value screening strategy in the U.S. population, and that genetic testing will improve diagnosis and treatment decisions most in cases of diagnostic uncertainty (e.g., borderline high cholesterol or absent family history). We hypothesize that a machine-learning algorithm will avoid the costs and complexity of universal screening, while yielding a similar case yield, as long as cholesterol testing is sufficiently common in children.  This study will identify the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population and the most influential data based on current knowledge and set the stage for efficiently designed clinical trials of FH screening. This study will be a test case for the concept of a “precision” population health approach to screening for genetically-determined diseases in the general population. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder characterized by lifetime elevated cholesterol, which, if uncontrolled, is associated with premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Conflicting current national guidelines highlight that the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population is controversial: it is unclear if screening should start in childhood or adulthood, or if it should include genetic testing. We propose to synthesize data from national surveys, high quality cohort studies, and clinical trials of cholesterol lowering interventions in a lifetime cardiovascular disease risk computer simulation model to project the life time health impact of different FH screening approaches and identify optimal screening strategies in children and adults.","Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches",10152666,R01HL141823,"['Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Cardiology', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer Simulation', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Coronary heart disease', 'County', 'Data', 'Decision Analysis', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Family member', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Policy', 'Hepatocyte', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Low Prevalence', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Preventive treatment', 'Proxy', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'economic evaluation', 'economic value', 'genetic testing', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'lifestyle intervention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'models and simulation', 'pediatric patients', 'population based', 'population health', 'premature', 'premature atherosclerosis', 'prevent', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'treatment strategy', 'uptake']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,788885,558628098
"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States. We propose to use electronic health record data to improve our ability to accurately classify risk and identify those who would benefit from preventive therapies. Improved risk prediction will shed light on the mechanisms of CVD and potentially reduce incidence, save lives, and lower health care costs.",Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,10063011,R01HL136659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hybrids', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Minnesota', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Touch sensation', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'feature extraction', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genetic panel test', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'multiple data types', 'next generation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'personalized care', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'research clinical testing', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'time use', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,794994,276703803
"Portable GC detector for breath-based COVID diagnostics Project Summary/Abstract: This proposal has two major goals: 1) Define signature exhaled breath volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections, and 2) Develop a portable chemical sensing device that can capture and detect exhaled VOCs and includes machine learning algorithms for automated data processing and results interpretation. This project will bring a portable sensor forward into clinical use with the aim of supplementing COVID-19 diagnostics with a reagentless alternative. Breath testing of exhaled VOC biomarkers is a relatively new concept that has the potential to transform healthcare in the US and globally. Our overarching hypothesis is that a miniature breath analysis device can measure signatures of exhaled breath VOCs in real-time and correlate their profile to viral upper respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV-2, even asymptomatically. In Aim #1, we propose a prospective, observational study to analyze breath samples from COVID-19 positive and negative subjects, solely for the purpose of analysis through gold standard GC- MS to define breath VOC biomarkers of infection. We will recruit subjects at two local sites, the UC Davis Medical Center (Sacramento, CA) and VA Northern California Health Care System (Mather, CA), where MPI Dr. Kenyon and Co-Is Drs. Harper and Schivo have joint clinical appointments. Our group has a proven track record to conduct these types of clinical breath studies. In Aim #2, we will develop a portable breath analysis device using our novel miniature differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) detector, coupled with chip-based gas chromatography. DMS is a subset of ion mobility spectrometry and detects VOCs at ambient temperatures and pressures, making it highly appropriate for portable devices. This device would include our custom chip- based preconcentrator, which is packed with a chemical sorbent for extraction of VOCs from breath, and will compare functionality of a compact commercially available GC column to a micro-GC column chip from Deviant, a subcontractor in this work. Individual components of this device have already been developed, and under direction of MPI Prof. Davis, Chair of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, a team of research engineers would integrate these pieces together into a single unit. Collaborator Prof. Chuah would guide development of a custom software package for the device with machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities for automated data processing and interpretation. The device would be placed in the hands of clinicians, who would provide feedback that engineers would immediately incorporate into the device and return to the clinicians for more testing. Under Aim #3, our team would process the GC-MS and GC-DMS data generated in this work, identifying a novel VOC profile for COVID-19 diagnostics. Aim #4 would initiate towards the end of this study to develop both a regulatory pathway & contract manufacturing plan for large scale production and deployment of the device for clinical approval. These efforts are supported by collaborator Dr. Nam Tran, Director of Clinical Pathology & Clinical Chemistry at the UC Davis Medical Center. Project Narrative: In the United States and worldwide, public health experts agree that nations must increase their capacity to test for COVID-19, yet global supplies for testing materials remain scarce. This project would lead to the development of an entirely new type of COVID-19 test, one that could diagnose infections with only a breath sample. Through this proposal, our team would develop a portable device that could identify people with COVID-19 infections by analyzing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in exhaled breath.",Portable GC detector for breath-based COVID diagnostics,10266337,U18TR003795,"['2019-nCoV', 'Aerospace Engineering', 'Appointment', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Breath Tests', 'COVID diagnostic', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 diagnostic', 'COVID-19 test', 'California', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Chemistry', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consultations', 'Contact Tracing', 'Contracts', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhalation', 'Feedback', 'Fingerprint', 'Flushing', 'Funding', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heating', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Materials Testing', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical center', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Observational Study', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Rapid diagnostics', 'Reagent', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Spectrometry', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Respiratory Infections', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'detector', 'deviant', 'differential expression', 'disease transmission', 'graphical user interface', 'instrument', 'intelligent algorithm', 'ion mobility', 'large scale production', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pandemic disease', 'portability', 'pressure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'risk mitigation', 'scale up', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'volatile organic compound']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,U18,2021,975463,254622553
"Effective, Reagent-free Detection of the Odor Signature of Covid-19 Infection Using a Nano-Enabled Sensor Array PROJECT SUMMARY COVID-19 presents a public health emergency: There is a critical need for rapid, not reagent intensive, non- invasive testing technologies. This program will lead to the production of a prototype system to diagnose COVID-19 infection using the body odor signature of the disease. Our goal is to maximize societal impact by creating a validated prototype that can be used in a community or workplace setting by minimally trained personnel for low-cost, on-the-spot diagnosis within minutes. The system will be developed in a manner that puts it on a pathway for rapid FDA approval. The Research Aims are: Aim 1. Optimization, assembly, and integration of a prototype system with the ability to odor signature of COVID-19 in samples of body odor. The system will be simple to use, pose essentially zero risk to the operator and the test subject, and report a result within minutes. The production cost at scale will be approximately $9,000 for the complete measurement system, with a per test cost of approximately $0.50. The design and construction of the prototype will be conducted by Novo Engineering, a leading firm with extensive experience in medical device development. Aim 2. Software development. Software for the system from VOC sampling to final diagnostic result will be developed to ensure error-free operation of the device. Our preliminary results suggest that simple linear discriminant analysis (LDA) does an excellent job of classifying VOCs from human body odor as COVID-19 positive or negative (92% sensitivity and 87% specificity). Optimization of the sensor array (Aim 1) and use of richer feature sets in our classifier models will lead to further performance improvements in the prototype system. Aim 3. System Benchmarking and Validation. We will benchmark the full prototype system against a number of VOC mixtures, with and without in vitro skin models. The system will undergo extensive testing against body odor samples from individuals with pathological conditions other than COVID-19 and other sources of potentially confounding VOCs. The prototype will be validated against 1000 samples drawn from the COVID-SAFE program at Penn. The screening will include all members of the Penn community, and represents incredible racial and ethnic diversity as well as a wide variance in age, sex, and gender. Aim 4. Regulatory Approval Plan The plan will be developed under the direction of Sr/Key personnel John Fuson, JD, an attorney at Crowell & Moring LLP and a former Associate Chief Counsel at FDA. Novo Engineering has extensive experience in guiding prototype design in alignment with the requirements for FDA approval. The proposed COVID-19 VOC-based testing device will be regulated by the FDA, likely as a Class I or II medical device. Because there is no clear predicate device to reference in this case, we intend to submit a direct de novo petition to FDA asking the agency to categorize and clear the proposed COVID-19 testing device as Class I or Class II without reference to any predicate. PROJECT NARRATIVE This program addresses the critical unmet need of an effective means to screen for COVID-19 infection, and potentially other novel virus infections, in a community setting based upon the body odor signature of the disease. The program will result in a validated prototype system, with a test time of minutes, a test cost of approximately $0.50, on a path to rapid FDA approval.","Effective, Reagent-free Detection of the Odor Signature of Covid-19 Infection Using a Nano-Enabled Sensor Array",10266403,U18TR003775,"['Address', 'Age', 'Astronomy', 'Benchmarking', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 screening', 'COVID-19 testing', 'Carbon Nanotubes', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Florida', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Housekeeping', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Human body', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Information Sciences', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Lawyers', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Nose', 'Occupations', 'Odors', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Production', 'RADx', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 negative', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Software Engineering', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visual', 'Workplace', 'animal care', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'community setting', 'coronavirus disease', 'cost', 'design', 'design and construction', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'high standard', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'nano', 'nanosensors', 'next generation', 'novel virus', 'operation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health emergency', 'racial diversity', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'screening program', 'sensor', 'sex', 'software development', 'software systems', 'vapor', 'volatile organic compound']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,U18,2021,999830,593605914
"A Handheld Microchip for GC analysis of breath to screen for COVID-19 Project Summary  The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented societal suffering and economic disruption. In the United States, more than six million people have contracted COVID-19 and more than one hundred ninety thousand patients have died of this disease to date. Although current COVID-19 diagnostic testing technologies are critical for slowing the spread of the virus and preventing future outbreaks, they are not practical for field use. Current diagnostic tests are cumbersome to perform because they use aqueous solutions, require multiple steps, and hours-to-days to obtain results. Since the US began to reopen the economy in May, there has been a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a diagnostic approach that is non-invasive, portable, and can rapidly provide test results.  The overall goal of the project is to develop a mobile breath analysis technology for rapid screening for COVID-19 using a handheld breath collection tool and a portable GC with a photoionization detector (PID). The handheld tool will be a closed system for trapping select volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on a microfabricated chip. The captured VOCs will be eluted with ethanol and then analyzed using a commercially available, portable GC-PID instrument. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms will be applied to recognize the VOC pattern that correlates with COVID-19 infection. The central innovation is the microfabricated chip that captures carbonyl compounds in exhaled breath and thus serves as a preconcentrator, which enables analysis of carbonyl VOCs by the portable GC-PID. The hypothesis is that the carbonyl metabolome in exhaled breath is directly related to the body’s reaction to the novel coronavirus infection, and changes in the carbonyl VOC composition in exhaled breath relative to healthy controls can be used to detect both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.  Three specific aims are proposed to fulfill the overall goal. Aim 1 is to build a disposable handheld breath analyzer tool for concentrating carbonyl VOCs. Aim 2 is to identify VOC patterns in the breath of COVID-19 patients by machine learning algorithms. Aim 3 is to integrate portable GC technology with the breath sampling tool for COVID-19 screening guided by an AI system. The University of Louisville is uniquely suited to rapidly transition the microchip technology to field use because of the PI and Co-PI’s experience in breath analysis and translational research, and the project team’s experience in virology, infectious diseases, biostatistics, and artificial intelligence as well as the state-of-the-art facilities that include a MicroNano Technology Center, Biosafety Level 3 Regional Biocontainment Lab, and an NIH-funded REACH program. 8. Project Narrative  This project will develop a mobile breath analysis technology for rapid screening for COVID-19 using a handheld breath collection tool and a portable GC with a photoionization detector (PID). Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms will be used to analyze the detected signals of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath by the portable GC for detection of COVID-19 patients.

"Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations Abstract: The high aerosolized transmissibility of COVID, long asymptomatic incubation period, and highly variable presentation attributes of the COVID pandemic have proven challenging in many settings where patchwork pandemic responses have disproportionately negatively impacted vulnerable socioeconomic, minority, and disabled sub-populations. Unfortunately, these dire trends are only made more acute in settings that feature populations with limited mobility and little to no ability to self-isolate (dense concentrated populations [DCPs]), such as residential nursing homes, schools, drug rehabilitation services, prison and psychiatric facility populations, and high-frequency essential medical services, such as chemotherapy infusion clinics or dialysis units. In these DCP settings, limited diagnostic testing, prolonged indoor contact, limitations in cleaning and filtration capacities, support staff shortages, pre-existing comorbidities, and lack of effective infectious disease surveillance systems all collude to drive an increased COVID burden in DCPs. From this, it is clear that alternative detection strategies for DCPs are urgently needed to improve local capacity to monitor COVID outbreaks, mitigate their spread, and thus reduce inequitable disease and mortality burdens in these under-resourced and often overcrowded settings. In previous work, we developed a first generation detection system using heart rate data from commercially-available Fitbit Ionic wearable devices to detect the onset of COVID and other infectious diseases up to 10 days before users self-reported symptom onset (overall sensitivity 67% prior to symptom onset). Here, we propose to further develop this system for the improved detection of COVID and other infectious diseases in DCPs using existing wearable fitness devices in a wireless and interoperable digital health framework that centralizes all wearable-derived data on PHD while tailoring its presentation and health event alert system to the IT capabilities and needs of each DCP setting. In this, not only will we adapt our existing infection detection algorithms for each DCP’s particular baseline characteristics, IT infrastructure, and needs, but also use incoming data to further optimize the performance of those algorithms for continuous improvement in the sensitivity, specificity, and alert lead time for COVID onset. This will quickly enable under-resourced DCP support staff to access and use world-class COVID surveillance data in identifying individual infection events, implementing isolation, cleaning, and testing policies, and minimizing transmission, thus reducing the burden of COVID in DCP settings and reducing DCP morbidity and mortality overall. Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations Narrative: The myriad risks and health burdens accompanying the ongoing COVID pandemic have disproportionately impacted under-resourced settings with dense, concentrated populations that cannot readily transition to isolation or remote care. While diagnostic testing is increasingly available, it remains inaccessible to too many and highlights an urgent unmet need for alternative methods to detect COVID infection and spread. In previous work using online machine learning and commercially-available fitness wearables, we have demonstrated remote detection of COVID onset up to 7 days in advance of symptoms, which we here propose to optimize and extend to diverse dense concentrated population settings for ongoing and effective COVID surveillance.",Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations,10274232,R01NR020105,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'COVID detection', 'COVID diagnostic', 'COVID test', 'COVID testing', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Filtration', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informed Consent', 'Infrastructure', 'Infusion procedures', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Lead', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prisons', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Residential Facilities', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Methods', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Weight', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'aerosolized', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'comorbidity', 'coronavirus disease', 'dashboard', 'data acquisition', 'demographics', 'design', 'detection platform', 'digital health', 'drug rehabilitation', 'fitbit', 'fitness', 'higher education', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'operation', 'pandemic disease', 'rehabilitation service', 'remote health care', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'socioeconomics', 'stem', 'surveillance data', 'surveillance study', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NINR,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1121730,560644462
