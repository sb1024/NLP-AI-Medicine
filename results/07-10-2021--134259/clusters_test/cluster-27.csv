"Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability, and there are more than 5.3 million persons in the US alone with chronic executive attention and cognitive dysfunction. There is a funda- mental gap in knowledge of the functional and structural mechanisms underlying executive attention impair- ments after TBI. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery or, ultimately, create individualized therapies. The long-term goal of this integrated research effort is to identify the mechanism(s) underlying cognitive deficits in TBI patients, as this will enable accurate classifica- tion of their impairments, more accurate prognoses and precise evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions. The overall objective of this proposal is to relate clinically applicable EEG metrics of executive attention to quantitative metrics of structural connectivity alterations within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit (medial frontal cortex, striatum and central thalamus) and to evaluate their role in predicting cognitive outcomes after TBI. The central hypothesis is that individually measured electrophysiologic responses and anatomical injuries within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit of TBI subjects will correlate with executive attention deficits, as measured by the ANT, and accurately predict broad cognitive outcomes. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work from two studies of EEG and diffusion MRI in TBI patients, as well as related published research supporting the underly- ing model in more severely brain-injured subjects. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that char- acterizing the relationship between the anterior forebrain mesocircuit and executive attention deficits at an indi- vidual level, using both physiological and anatomical measurements, will allow insight into the biological un- derpinnings of the deficits and help frame mechanistic approaches to future diagnosis and therapy. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. The first Aim is to determine the extent to which executive attentional impairment, measured with the ANT, relates to injury-related changes in the anterior forebrain mesocircuit a) physiology (EEG) and b) white matter connectivity (diffusion MRI). Part c) of Aim 1 will integrate the two modalities and relate them back to clinically-applicable EEG. {Aim 2 is to a) cross-sectionally relate and b) longitudinally predict cognitive outcomes via cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to imaging metrics collected in Aim 1.} The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opin- ion, because they propose to link attentional impairments, as measured by the ANT, to measures of physiology and connectivity on an individual basis and predict cognitive outcomes {using machine learning.} The pro- posed research is significant, because knowledge of the biology underlying attention impairment will allow for its evaluation as a prognostic measure and provide targets for effective individualized interventions. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to enable development of therapies that can dramatically improve the quality of life for millions that remain unable to return to prior levels of functioning within their communities after TBI. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the mechanisms underlying attention impairments after traumatic brain injury is ultimately expected to lead to the development of sensitive prognostic measures and individualized therapeutic interventions. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NINDS' mission in that it seeks fundamental knowledge about the brain in order to reduce the burden of neurological disease.",Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury,10062524,R01NS102646,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Attentional deficit', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Salvelinus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic Brain Injury recovery', 'Variant', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'disability', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'frontal lobe', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'performance tests', 'personalized predictions', 'prognostic', 'recruit', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'tractography', 'translational impact', 'white matter']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2021,553209,227555357
"Auditory precursors of language delay in toddlers with autism spectrum disorders Abstract Language delay and impairments are common in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), as are sensory (including auditory) anomalies. Since acquisition of spoken language relies on the integrity of the auditory system, language delay and impairments may be related to sound processing abnormalities that are frequently observed in children with ASDs (despite normal peripheral hearing). However, it is not understood if and how early auditory brain anomalies may developmentally contribute to impaired language development.  This project will examine the maturation of auditory and language systems in the brain across early childhood, during the critical period for language acquisition. We will employ a longitudinal design and multimodal neuroimaging, including high-resolution anatomical, diffusion, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with added frequent and extensive behavioral and neuropsychological assessments. Our central hypothesis is that early disruptions to cortical sound processing precede and predict language impairments in ASDs and may thus be considered causal contributors – a hypothesis that has been frequently considered in the literature, but never tested at the neural level.  Our aims are to thoroughly characterize the structural integrity and functional differentiation of the cortical auditory and language systems (Aim 1) and their maturational trajectories (Aim 2) in toddlers with ASDs and age-matched typically developing peers. This will allow us to establish whether neural abnormalities in cortical processing of complex sounds in toddlers are predictive of language development and social behavior at the pre-school age (Aim 3). The rationale and translational significance of this project are that identification of alterations in brain development linked to language delay and impairment in the first years of life will allow for more targeted interventions in the auditory domain at a time when they are most effective. Project narrative The project aims to find causes of language impairment in children with autism spectrum disorders by studying the brain organization of the auditory system in toddlers at the very earliest age of provisional diagnosis. The overarching hypothesis is that atypical auditory processing contributes to language delay and impairment. Pinpointing auditory causes of language problems in children with ASDs may inform early interventions.",Auditory precursors of language delay in toddlers with autism spectrum disorders,10132296,R01DC017736,"['Age', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Anisotropy', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Early Intervention', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hearing', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Morphology', 'Neurites', 'Neuropsychology', 'Nursery Schools', 'Organizational Change', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Radial', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sensory', 'Sleep', 'Social Behavior', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TEP1 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'auditory processing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'critical period', 'density', 'early childhood', 'gray matter', 'indexing', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'language impairment', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning method', 'molecular modeling', 'multimodality', 'myelination', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'peer', 'phonology', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sound', 'theories', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,588497,35319116
"Creating an artificial intelligence therapy-to-data feedback loop for child developmental healthcare Project Summary There is a sharp and increasing imbalance between the number of children with autism in need of care and the availability of specialists certified to treat the disorder in its multi-faceted manifestations. The autism community faces a dual clinical challenge: how to direct scarce specialist resources to service the diverse array of phenomes and how to monitor and validate best practices in treatment. Clinicians must now look to solutions that scale in a decentralized fashion, placing data capture, remote monitoring, and therapy increasingly into the hands of families. Using artificial intelligence (AI) and large amounts of labeled human emotion computer vision data, we have developed a solution for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glasses and Android smartphones to deliver real time social cues to individuals with autism in the child’s natural environment. We hypothesize that this informatic system can provide real-time therapy in a way that scales to meet the demand of the growing population of autism families, including underserved minorities, while growing data that can be used to measure progress over time and in the development of novel AI. Our first aim will focus on the development of a deep learning model that enables dynamic emotion recognition in the real world, and on domain adaptation procedures that enable minimal manual labeling to personalize the model for optimal accuracy on the individuals with whom the child will interact most regularly at home. Our second aim will focus on the human computer interface, namely the design of the user experience with the Android application that controls the sessions run on the Google Glass wearable. We will work our clinical colleagues and with groups of autism families to develop and enhance a set of games and activity modes that create social engagements ideal for emotion therapy, including an emotion capture and a charades game. The third aim will test our central hypothesis that the Glass system can create a therapy-to-data feedback loop that delivers clinical care while growing data for measurement and model development. We will work with up to 200 children ages 4-8 who have recent autism diagnoses and do not have access to standard behavioral therapy. We will build a community of autism families through crowdsourcing techniques, befitting the mobile paradigm embodied by our work, and through close collaboration with behavioral therapy providers, the autism outreach organization Autism Speaks, and the digital healthcare company, Cognoa. The families will work with us on design and refinement of our “Superpower Glass” system for fit, engagement, and function of use for both therapy and data capture. Importantly, we will send units home with families to use the device for at least 3 twenty-minute sessions per week for a minimum of 6 weeks. This remote period will generate a massive database to quantify overall social learning, emotion comprehension, eye contact, and sustained social acuity. In all, our work program will show that mobile wearable AI can bring the social learning process out of the clinic and into the real world for faster and more adaptive intervention. Project Narrative There is a sharp and growing imbalance between the number of clinical care providers available and the number of children with an autism diagnosis that leave most children without therapy until after critical periods in development have passed. We intend to address this problem through creation of a machine learning-enabled wearable that brings effective care to the home and empowers both parents, patients, and clinicians with mobile solutions that personalize care delivery to dramatically improve children’s outcomes. The Superpower Glass system, which delivers social cues to children during real-time interactions and provides several engagement modes for families, is a promising solution that enables greater access to care for families across the US, and potentially, across the globe.!",Creating an artificial intelligence therapy-to-data feedback loop for child developmental healthcare,10164858,R01LM013083,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Android', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Support', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Self-Direction', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Specialist', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Variant', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'applied behavior analysis', 'autism community', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'care delivery', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'combat', 'critical period', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital healthcare', 'experience', 'improved', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'model development', 'novel', 'outreach', 'personalized care', 'phenome', 'practical application', 'programs', 'prototype', 'remote monitoring', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'social engagement', 'social learning', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'underserved minority', 'user-friendly']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,649383,560644462
"Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence ABSTRACT  Executive function (EF) undergoes dramatic development during adolescence, and is impaired across multiple psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Despite this fact, the neural substrates of EF development remain incompletely understood. Here, we propose to study the development of EF using cutting- edge techniques from network science. In this proposal, we will recruit 140 participants ages 10-16. This sample will include 50 with ADHD, 50 with psychosis-spectrum diagnoses, and 40 typically developing comparators. Using an accelerated longitudinal design, all participants will be followed and undergo cognitive testing, clinical assessment, and advanced multi-modal neuroimaging at 18 month intervals, yielding an average of 2.5 sessions per participant. This design will allow us to chart the development of structural and functional brain networks during adolescence, and delineate how abnormalities of brain network development are associated with deficits in EF performance, activation, and dynamics. Our overarching hypothesis is that the development of modular yet integrated brain networks during adolescence allows for specific patterns of EF activation and dynamics, and represents a fundamental mechanism for EF development. We posit that abnormalities of network development will be associated with executive dysfunction that is dimensionally present across psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Accordingly, in Aim 1 of this proposal, we will chart the longitudinal development of both structural and functional brain networks, and define how abnormalities of network development are associated with dimensional EF deficits in youth with ADHD and psychosis. In Aim 2, we will define how abnormal development of brain network topology is associated with alterations of executive activation and dynamics. In Aim 3, we will integrate high-dimensional imaging data using advanced multivariate analytic techniques to create a dimensional predictor of executive dysfunction. Finally, in Aim 4, we will share both raw and processed data, creating a valuable new resource for the neuroscience community. This proposal capitalizes on complementary skills of the PIs and the research team, including expertise in brain development, network science, psychopathology, cognitive science, and high dimensional imaging statistics. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of executive dysfunction across psychiatric disorders in adolescence. RELEVANCE Executive function is an important domain of cognition that develops rapidly during adolescence, and is impacted by multiple psychiatric disorders including ADHD and psychosis. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in brain network development produce executive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders may be critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing disability and limiting the costs to society at large.",Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence,10112308,R01MH113550,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Equation', 'Evolution', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Failure', 'Fractals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk-Taking', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Wolves', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'cognitive testing', 'cost', 'data resource', 'design', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'executive function', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'multilevel analysis', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'prisma', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'software development', 'statistics', 'theories']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,715561,593605914
"The Development of Individual Differences in Adolescent Brain Structure and Risk Abstract  Individual differences in brain structure, including cortical morphology and the white matter connectome are associated with risk for psychiatric disorders. The first year of life is a period of rapid and dynamic structural and functional brain development and new data from our cohort suggests that a large portion of individual differences in brain structure in 10 and 12 year olds is already present in the first year or two of life. Early adolescence and puberty is the second major period of postnatal brain development, characterized by dynamic structural and functional brain maturation and reorganization, and emerging risk for psychiatric disorders, though it is not known how this period of development contributes to individual differences in brain structure and risk. The UNC Early Brain Development Study is a unique and innovative longitudinal study that has followed children, enrolled prenatally, with imaging and cognitive/behavioral assessments at birth, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 years. 482 children from this cohort are now reaching adolescence, and we propose to follow these children at 12, 14 and 16 years of age. MRIs, including structural, diffusion tensor, and resting state functional imaging, will be performed. Cognitive and behavioral development will be assessed, with a focus on the phenotypes of executive function, attention, and anxiety, consistent with RDoC constructs important for psychiatric disorder risk. We will determine how adolescent brain development contributes to individual differences in relation to early childhood development and whether the white matter connectome is a useful early imaging biomarker. Knowledge gained in this study will improve our basic understanding of human brain development, and ultimately inform early intervention strategies that prevent or mitigate risk and illness severity. Relevance New knowledge gained in this study will provide a dramatically improved framework for understanding childhood brain development and its relationship to cognitive and behavioral outcomes in adolescence, and to risk for subsequent psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative For years it has been hypothesized that psychiatric disorders are the result of abnormal trajectories of childhood brain development, though there is little direct evidence to support that hypothesis. The UNC Early Brain Development Study is a longitudinal study that has followed children with imaging and developmental assessments from birth to age 10 years. We will study brain structure and function in these children at 12, 14, and 16 years with MRI to see if we can identify childhood predictors of behavior in adolescence that is considered at risk for psychiatric illness, which will ultimately help target periods of childhood development for early intervention.",The Development of Individual Differences in Adolescent Brain Structure and Risk,10206731,R01MH123747,"['10 year old', '12 year old', '16 year old', '4 year old', '8 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Puberty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'adolescent brain development', 'behavioral outcome', 'brain abnormalities', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'disorder risk', 'early adolescence', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'executive function', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'postnatal period', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'sex', 'social', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,763760,511185245
