"Maximizing the predictive power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens PROJECT SUMMARY We currently have an unprecedented ability to profile the genetic- and pathway-level changes that occur in cancer. Yet, clinicians lack the diverse arsenal of drugs needed to treat subpopulations of patients more effectively, reduce side effects and offer second-line treatment when drug resistance emerges. There is a pressing need to dramatically increase the repertoire of drugs available to fight cancer. Advances in automated microscopy and computer vision, allow the widespread use of phenotypic profiling in early drug discovery. In this grant, we address two challenges. First, the power of phenotypic profiling has led to a growing number of large, disparate image datasets. In aim 1, we will develop machine-learning approaches that combine disparate datasets to obtain accurate predictions of uncharacterized compound function. Second, phenotypic screens can identify candidate compounds across multiple, diverse pathways, but often only use a single cancer cell line. In aim 2, we will develop strategies to identify minimal collections of cell lines that maximize detection of small molecule activities. Successful execution will: increase the power of phenotypic profiling by harnessing existing phenotypic screening datasets and providing a rational approach for selecting cell lines that maximize the chance of discovering hits in desired pathways. In this proposal, we will develop computational and experimental methods to maximize the power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens. Our studies will increase the power of phenotypic profiling by harnessing screens performed across the world, providing a rational approach for maximizing the chance of discovering hits for diverse pathways in future screens, and identifying novel compounds that expand our ability to perturb cancer-relevant pathways. Our proposal is designed to accelerate the pace of early drug discovery.","Maximizing the predictive power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens",10090573,R01CA184984,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell Line', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Proteomics', 'Research Personnel', 'Structure', 'Time', 'base', 'cancer type', 'chemical genetics', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'druggable target', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'proteostasis', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'small molecule', 'transcriptomics']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,1,685608202

"Hybridized structure- and ligand- based drug discovery approaches targeting ASCT2, an amino acid transporter critical for upregulated cell proliferation in numerous cancer types Hybridized structure- and ligand- based drug discovery approaches targeting ASCT2, an amino acid transporter critical for upregulated cell proliferation in numerous cancer types  This proposal outlines the protocols and techniques I will be using to optimize drug discovery of ASCT2, a promising target for anti-cancer therapeutics. ASCT2 plays a key role in increasing the glutamine influx for tumor cells to maintain such high metabolic rates required for rapid proliferation. The first structures of ASCT2 were recently determined experimentally, making this a newly viable target for structure-based studies ASCT2 was only recently discovered to play a critical role in cancer cell metabolism and little medicinal chemistry efforts have been focused on ASCT2 antagonist development allowing immense potential for breaking into new compound scaffolds for further testing. Currently, there have not been any ASCT2 drug campaigns that incorporate computational drug discovery methods and this proposal outlines the first studies dedicated to this.  Many institutions and pharmaceutical companies have implemented computational strategies into drug discovery pipelines as a means to produce viable drug candidates in a more cost-efficient and timely manner. Depending on the target of interest, researchers focus more intently on either ligand-based (LB) or structure-based (SB) methods, but rarely are these two methods hybridized in a sophisticated fashion. By utilizing strategies of both LB- and SB- computational drug discovery, I intend to merge the advantages of both methodologies as a means to sample and filter large chemical space more efficiently. Our lab has active development in two computational chemistry software suites: Rosetta primarily focuses on SB methods whereas the Biology and Chemistry Library (BCL) contains advanced cheminformatics toolsets for LB methods. The focus of my project will be to integrate the RosettaDrugDesign code to allow a more extensive, yet efficient sampling of chemical space using ligand-based techniques. We intend to incorporate these more advanced LB techniques available in the BCL, including multi-tasking artificial neural networks for Quantitative Structure- Activity Relationship predictions, to filter compounds during docking simulations within the RosettaDrugDesign. By bringing together the structure prediction abilities of Rosetta and small- molecule tools of BCL, we anticipate exceptional advances in our abilities to efficiently design drugs for ASCT2. Project Narrative The upregulated influx of amino acids is critical to maintain an altered metabolic state for rapidly proliferating cells such as those found in tumors, making transporters such as ASCT2 a promising target for cancer therapeutics. Computational-based drug discovery methods have not been heavily utilized for ASCT2 due to lack of an experimentally determined structure; however with the recently solved structure, these methods are now possible and highly favorable for guiding medicinal chemistry efforts. This proposal outlines the plans for hybridized structure- and ligand-based approaches for computational drug discovery of ASCT2 antagonists and the experimental validation obtained utilizing in silico methods.","Hybridized structure- and ligand- based drug discovery approaches targeting ASCT2, an amino acid transporter critical for upregulated cell proliferation in numerous cancer types",10003012,F31CA243353,"['Alanine', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Transporter', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Cysteine', 'Data', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Education', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Facility Accesses', 'Formulation', 'Glutamine', 'Homologous Protein', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Paper', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Play', 'Proliferating', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Pythons', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Serine', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'anti-cancer therapeutic', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cancer type', 'cheminformatics', 'computational chemistry', 'computing resources', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in silico', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'interest', 'member', 'metabolic rate', 'method development', 'multitask', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'structural biology', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor metabolism']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,38247,117374875
"Assessing the power of primary drug-screens to predict clinical response. PROJECT SUMMARY Precision oncology relies on the hypothesis that further characterizing a patient's tumor will lead to better predictions of treatment response. While this approach effectively breaks diagnoses into smaller and smaller subtypes likely to respond to a given targeted inhibitor, the downside is it results in highly fragmented clinical data spread across multiple treatment arms. The more progress the field makes in assigning new therapies, the harder it will be to accrue adequate sample size to test another therapy. Direct screening of cancer cell lines and primary samples on panels of targeted inhibitors is a uniquely promising approach to this problem, turning every patient sample into a hundred mini experiments, but clinical validation of in vitro drug-response predictions have been hampered by limited numbers of patients who are screened and actually treated with any given drug. Such an evaluation is critical to determine the predictive value gained from drug screening of patient samples. Over the past seven years the Knight Cancer Institute has performed drug screening paired alongside genomic and/or RNA sequencing for over 600 primary leukemic samples. Within two years, we will have accumulated over 200 patients not only screened for in vitro drug response but then treated with matched targeted inhibitors. I will leverage this existing and growing dataset to interrogate the power of in vitro drug screening data to predict clinical response using retrospective data. I will establish a robust framework for primary drug screening and analysis, build interpretable models for clinical decision making, and explore mechanisms controlling drug response. This project will result in improvements to high-throughput drug screening, a thorough accounting of the predictive power of in vitro drug screening, and candidates for treatment combinations in resistant tumors. My goal is to become an independent investigator and cross-disciplinary leader in patient sample multi-omic profiling, targeted therapy selection, and translational oncology. During my mentored phase I will be receiving guidance from Dr. Emek Demir, an expert in computational modeling of systems biology, Dr. Jeffery Tyner, a leader in patient sample drug screening and validation, and Dr. Brian Druker, a pioneer of targeted cancer therapy and director of the Knight Cancer Institute. I will also improve my statistical understanding of complex systems by working with my advisory committee member Dr Tomi Mori, learn to integrate large datasets and predicting patient outcomes from Dr. Shannon McWeeney, and improve upon existing drug screening platforms and analysis methods with Dr. Laura Heiser. I am determined to attain an independent faculty position and my mentors have committed to assisting me in the application and transition process. PROJECT NARRATIVE A promising field of cancer treatment is targeted therapy, where each patient is prescribed different drugs precisely based on the features of their cancer. We have a large dataset of patients where we tested drugs on their cancer cells in the lab, and later the patient received the same drug as part of their therapy. I will investigate the best methods for testing drugs on each patient's cancer, how effective these tests are for predicting how well a treatment will work in each patient, and why some patients don't see the benefit from targeted therapy we normally expect.",Assessing the power of primary drug-screens to predict clinical response.,10092124,K99CA245896,"['ABL1 gene', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Aftercare', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Committee Members', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Screening', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'German population', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'care outcomes', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'conventional therapy', 'design', 'drug response prediction', 'drug sensitivity', 'drug testing', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'high-throughput drug screening', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'large datasets', 'leukemia', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'model design', 'multiple omics', 'multitask', 'new combination therapies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient screening', 'patient stratification', 'phosphoproteomics', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'predictive test', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'response', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'survival prediction', 'targeted agent', 'targeted cancer therapy', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment arm', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'validation studies']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,137956,304670088
"Platform for high-throughput biomechanical measurements using metallic islands on boron nitride nanosheets SUMMARY This proposal describes a new platform for high-throughput measurement of mechanical phenomena in cells. The platform is based on a type of strain sensor comprising metallic nanoislands supported by hexagonal boron nitride. Mechanical deformation produces a change in both the electrical resistance and the optical scattering of these sensors. These processes allow the detection of deformations ≤1 ppm (≤0.0001% strain). This unprecedented level of sensitivity permits the measurement of minute forces produced by cells that cannot be measured using existing methods, and the electrical signals can be analyzed rapidly using machine-learning algorithms. While this sensor has a broad range of potential applications in cell biology, we apply it here to a ubiquitous challenge in cardiovascular medicine and drug discovery. In particular, contractile dysfunction in cardiomyocytes is associated with a range of difficult-to-treat cardiomyopathies. In drug discovery, cardiotoxicity (myopathy, arrhythmia, or both) is a leading reason for the failure of drugs during development and aftermarket launch. For some classes of drugs—especially those used in chemotherapy—up to 30% of patients experience heart disease related to their treatment. Indeed, heart failure is the second most common reason for death of cancer patients. There are currently no assays that are both predictive of cardiotoxicity and are of sufficient throughput to implement early in drug development (i.e., when safer drug leads can be selected among analogues). We propose the use of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) bearing various disease-associated mutations as a test case of our nano-enabled biomechanical sensor. In particular, we will construct an array based on a “96-well” plate format combined with high-throughput analysis using a purpose-designed machine learning algorithm in order to measure the forces and kinetics of contractility of the cells. Such a platform would enable large-scale evaluation of disease mechanisms and accelerate therapeutic target discovery by permitting high-throughput, unbiased testing. This application offers the exciting possibility of introducing aspects of the biology of the human heart early in the discovery pipeline. More broadly, the platform we describe offers the potential of answering deep questions about mechanical phenomena in cells—“the mechanome”—which play critical roles in human health. NARRATIVE This proposal describes a platform for high-throughput measurement of mechanical forces in cells, which play major roles in human health. The platform is based on a type of strain sensor comprising metallic nanoislands supported by hexagonal boron nitride. As an application of this platform, we propose to measure the forces stem- cell derived cardiomyocytes which bear genetically encoded contractile dysfunction for drug screening.",Platform for high-throughput biomechanical measurements using metallic islands on boron nitride nanosheets,10158533,R21GM137151,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Boron', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dilated Cardiomyopathy', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Compounding', 'Drug Screening', 'Electrical Resistance', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Individual', 'Island', 'Kinetics', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Myopathy', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Relaxation', 'Role', 'Sarcomeres', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'analog', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'cellular engineering', 'chemotherapy', 'design', 'detection limit', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mechanical force', 'mechanical properties', 'metallicity', 'nano', 'nanofabrication', 'response', 'sensor', 'stem cells', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2021,182532,524978793
"Imaging the healing of ocular injury caused by vesicants to identify new therapies Chemical warfare and the use of mustard gas on civilian population poses a major risk. Vesicating agents, such as mustard gas, cause severe damage to the corneas that can result in blindness and severe loss of sight. There are currently limited therapeutic options for treatment of damage caused by vesicating agents. To enable the rapid development of much needed medical countermeasures, the proposed work will test the possibility of drug repurposing. Drug repurposing strategies are based on the identification of new uses for existing drugs. Drug repurposing is a demonstrated successful strategy that can lower the cost of drug development and reduce development time. The key challenge in drug repurposing is the need to identify novel drug-disease relationships. To address this challenge we will deploy a set of innovative microscopy approaches that will provide rich data on the subtle aspects of the impact existing drugs have on corneal healing from chemical injury. Specifically, in Aim #1 we will perform a chemical screen of 770 existing drugs using live, organ culture, image-based assay. Mice corneas will be imaged for 48 hours after wound and sophisticated computer vision algorithm will be used to extract data on stem cell proliferation, cell death, cell migration, and wound closure. In Aim #2 we will construct spatiotemporal cornea-specific cell atlas of migration, proliferation, inflammatory signaling and gene expression response to chemical injury for controls, and drug-treated corneas. The cell atlases will provide a key resource on the process of chemical injury, the mechanism of action of existing therapies, and the mechanism of action of the most promising new drugs identified in Aim #1. Collectively, the results of this work will exploit the possibility of drug repurposing for the treatment of ocular injury caused by vesicants. The resource we will generate, i.e .the information on existing drugs and the detailed cell atlases of the process of healing will build the foundation for the rapid future development of much needed medical countermeasures. Chemical weapons such as mustard gas can cause severe damage to the eye and lead to blindness. Here we will use sophisticated microscopy tools to test how does the eye heal when treating by existing FDA approved drugs and generate an atlas of the cellular response to chemical injury. Our results will support efforts to repurpose existing drugs to provide much needed medical countermeasures to combat chemical warfare.",Imaging the healing of ocular injury caused by vesicants to identify new therapies,10137251,R21EY031283,"['Accidents', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Atlases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blindness', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chemical Agents', 'Chemical Injury', 'Chemical Warfare', 'Chemical Weapons', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cornea', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dexamethasone', 'Disease', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug usage', 'End Point Assay', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Eye Injuries', 'FDA approved', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Industrialization', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Maps', 'Mechlorethamine', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mustard Gas', 'Organ', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Poison', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporter', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Type I Epithelial Receptor Cell', 'Vesicants', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'combat', 'corneal epithelial wound healing', 'corneal regeneration', 'drug development', 'drug repurposing', 'first responder', 'healing', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medical countermeasure', 'migration', 'mouse model', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'response', 'response to injury', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem cell proliferation', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment effect', 'wound', 'wound closure', 'wound healing']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2021,218032,673201228
"Identifying existing, FDA-approved drugs with clinically protective effects against coronavirus disease 2019 using a big data approach Project Summary/Abstract Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a national and global public health emergency. Because the causative virus is novel, the present options for treatment are extremely limited, and an effective vaccine could be 1-2 years away. Thus, there is an urgent need for efficacious therapeutics against the disease. While development of new drugs is under way, that process is slow and resource-intensive. In the short- to-medium term, a superior strategy is to repurpose already existing drugs to treat the disease. Over 100 drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have shown in vitro, in silico, or theoretical effect against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, or the hyperinflammatory immune response it provokes. What is unclear is how many of these have a significant, protective effect on actual patients, as only a tiny fraction of these drugs is in clinical trials. Most of these agents are chronic medications, and thus there are millions of Americans who are already using them. The first aim of this study is to assess the degree of protection any of these drugs confers against the serious complications of COVID-19 while adjusting for known risk factors and confounders. The second aim is to search for additional interactions between drugs or combinations of drugs and specific demographic and/or clinical subgroups that could be protective or harmful. The Change Healthcare Database, a part of the COVID-19 Research Database, contains up-to-date health insurance claims data for about one- third of all Americans. Using this database, this study will evaluate the impact of these drugs on the risk of four important outcomes in patients who are COVID-19-positive: need for hospitalization, use of mechanical ventilation, shock, and death. Results will be risk-adjusted for the risk factors already well established to predict poor outcomes in COVID-19. This study will further mine the data for second- and third-order interactions between drugs or combinations of drugs and different subpopulations of patients using a novel machine learning method called the Feasible Solution Algorithm (FSA). The FSA enables the researcher to uncover higher-order statistical interactions in regression models, which leads to the identification of subgroups and complexities that are not always apparent with traditional regression models. If the results show candidate drugs with highly protective effects, these can be prioritized for prospective clinical studies. Drugs that show harmful effects can be considered for discontinuation in infected or high-risk patients. Project Narrative Repurposing existing drugs to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) is a much faster and more resource-effective approach than developing new drugs de novo. This holds promise because over 100 drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have shown in vitro, in silico, or theoretical activity against SARS- CoV-2 or the immune response it provokes. Using a large health insurance claims database, we will assess the potentially protective effects of each of these drugs on patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and search for interactions between multiple drugs and specific demographic and clinical subpopulations via a novel statistical algorithm.","Identifying existing, FDA-approved drugs with clinically protective effects against coronavirus disease 2019 using a big data approach",10195454,R21LM013683,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 treatment', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Immune response', 'In Vitro', 'Inpatients', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Judgment', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Mineralocorticoid Receptor', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protective Agents', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Shock', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vaccines', 'Virus', 'Vision', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'coronavirus disease', 'cyclooxygenase 1', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'demographics', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug repurposing', 'global health emergency', 'high risk', 'human data', 'immunomodulatory therapies', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insurance claims', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'off-label use', 'pandemic disease', 'patient subsets', 'preclinical study', 'prophylactic', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'public health emergency', 'sex']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE,R21,2021,225171,73765201
"Phenotypic Screening for Longevity Interventions Using Single-cell Epigenetic Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in understanding the biology of aging have raised the prospect of drug interventions to promote healthy aging in humans. However, such interventions should have essentially no toxicity or side effects. In practice, the throughput of drug testing (currently conducted in animals) is one of the major limitations for identifying interventions to promote healthy aging. Hence, a challenge is to identify candidate drugs able to induce rejuvenation and/or healthy aging, with minimal side effects in a high throughput fashion. Here we propose to take advantage of a novel high content screening approach based on imaging of epigenetic landscape in single cells. To meet the challenge, we propose to take advantage of a novel technique we have developed that is rooted in the analysis of epigenome topography at the single cell level, automated microscopy, and machine learning. “Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscapes” (MIEL) captures patterns of nuclear staining of epigenetic marks (e.g. acetylated and methylated histones) and employs machine learning to accurately distinguish between such patterns. Pertinent to this application, we have tested whether MIEL approach is suitable for building a phenotypic cell-based assay for inducers of longevity at the cellular level. Our preliminary results validated MIEL assay for a high content screening application to identify novel candidate pro-longevity compounds. In sum, we have developed and validated a high content cell-based screening assay capable of identifying pro-longevity/healthy aging compounds based on their effect on epigenetic signature.

"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,10141255,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates', 'Active Sites', 'Address', 'Aldehyde-Lyases', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Amino Alcohols', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Carbon', 'Complex', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Health', 'Homoserine', 'Human', 'Indoles', 'Industry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nature', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physical condensation', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Propanolamines', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Pyridoxal Phosphate', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Route', 'Solvents', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Threonine', 'Transaminases', 'Tryptophan Synthase', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'carboxylate', 'catalyst', 'chemical synthesis', 'cofactor', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug production', 'empowered', 'enzyme activity', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'serine containing aminolipid', 'serinol', 'success', 'thermostability', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,291940,81181560
"Combined Cardiomyopathy, e.g., of Cancer Chemotherapeutics, and Proarrhythmia for Cardiotoxicity Clinical Trials-in-a-Dish (CTiD) with iPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes Cardiotoxicity is a leading cause of drug discovery attrition across all of preclinical and clinical drug discovery. While the FDA and the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay initiative (CiPA) are focused primarily on predicting proarrhythmic effects, drug attrition due to cardiomyopathy, or primary cardiac cytotoxicity, may be even more prevalent, is typically currently only carried out via animal studies, and limits dosage for many cancer chemotherapeutics. Due to improving cancer survival, it is increasing common for more cancer survivors of some cancer types to die of cardiac diseases due to cancer treatment side effects than cancer recurrence. Cardiac contractions are initiated by electrical depolarizations (action potentials, APs) that propagate through the heart and initiate calcium (Ca2+) transients that activate the contractile apparatus. Importantly, dysregulation of Ca2+ can trigger inappropriate early-after- and delayed-after- depolarizations (EADs and DADs) that initiate arrhythmias, inhibit mitochondrial function, and pathologically alter expression of contractile proteins. Chemotherapy and other drugs can also directly impair mitochondrial function, which is primarily thought to cause cytotoxicity, but can also cause arrhythmias. Cardiomyocytes are also heterogeneous in their voltage, calcium, and contractile functions, and in their responses to therapeutic candidates. Thus, it is highly desirable to simultaneously measure AP, Ca2+ and contractile function on a cell- by-cell basis, in human cardiomyocytes, but this is not possible with current test methods. To address this unmet need we propose to develop a high throughput (robotic) Kinetic Image Cytometry that simultaneously quantifes voltage, calcium, and contractile motion in cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs). The hiPSC-CMs will be labeled with fluorescent indicators of calcium and voltage, and the cells imaged via high-speed automated microscopy during contractile activity. The use of hiPSC-CMs will enable “clinical trials” in a dish, in which test compounds are tested across cells representing several donors. Phase I of this Fast-Track STTR project will develop the basic protocol and perform a proof-of-concept screen of 30 test compounds on hiPSC-CMs representing 5 donors. In Phase II, a large validation study (~350 compounds, 7-concentration dose-response, 30 min and 72 hr exposures) will be performed. Artificial intelligence will be utilized to optimize the sensitivity and specificity of the assay by detecting complex arrhythmia waveforms. This assay represents a human-based preclinical model that will be less expensive and more predictive for cardiotoxicity testing than animal models and will be marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for contract research. FDA guidelines stipulate that all new drugs be tested for dangerous side-effects on the heart as part of preclinical research; however, the current tests are poorly predictive of both dangerous and safe drugs leading to unwarranted attrition and dangerous drugs reaching clinic. Human cardiomyocytes derived from donor tissue (iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes) are widely considered to hold great promise for clinical trial in a dish studies of drug cardiotoxicity. This STTR proposal is to commercialize a high throughput platform to accurately identify drug candidates that have cardiac side effects, in particular adding the ability to detect the type of primary heart cell damage common with anti-cancer drugs in a fully automated (high throughput) robotic assay for the first time, to improve the efficiency of preclinical research and the safety of human clinical trials, which will also likely have the added benefit of reducing animal research.","Combined Cardiomyopathy, e.g., of Cancer Chemotherapeutics, and Proarrhythmia for Cardiotoxicity Clinical Trials-in-a-Dish (CTiD) with iPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes",10268102,R42HL158510,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Aging', 'American', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Calcium', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Contract Services', 'Contractile Proteins', 'Dangerousness', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Industry', 'Female', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Cytometry', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mitochondria', 'Motion', 'Myocardium', 'Myopathy', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research Contracts', 'Risk Assessment', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sales', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology Transfer', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Donors', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'anti-cancer therapeutic', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer survival', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cell injury', 'cellular imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical predictors', 'compound 30', 'cost', 'cytotoxicity', 'dosage', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'heart cell', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'instrument', 'lead series', 'male', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'response', 'scale up', 'screening', 'side effect', 'therapeutic candidate', 'tool', 'tumor', 'validation studies', 'voltage']",NHLBI,"VALA SCIENCES, INC.",R42,2021,299871,0
"Computational prediction of gut microbiome-mediated drug metabolism Project Summary / Abstract Notwithstanding pre-clinical experiments and clinical trials performed to identify efficacy, side effects, and adverse drug reactions (ADRs), only 25-60% of patients respond favorably to prescribed drugs, leading to a cost of $30-$130 billion in the US annually. ADRs are partially attributed to the gut microbiome, i.e. the complex and dynamic community of microorganisms residing in gastrointestinal tract. The gut microbiome interacts with different types of xenobiotics including drugs, resulting in biotransformation of therapeutics into metabolites with altered disposition, efficacy, and toxicity. Gut microbiome-mediated drug metabolism leads to non-effective treatments as well as teratogenic, toxic, and lethal effects that in some cases were not recognized until the drug was on the market. As a result, leading pharmaceutical researchers have begun to recognize that the role of gut microbiome in drug metabolism should be accounted for in attempts to improve treatment effectiveness. However, despite extensive progress in gut microbiome research, there is currently no reliable, cost-effective approach to integrate gut-mediated drug metabolism in drug development pipelines. This Phase I proposal aims to address this challenge by developing a new computational platform with the ability to predict microbial metabolism of therapeutic drugs and to leverage that information to enhance drug design and development. We will employ a range of state-of-the-art computational biology techniques to reliably screen for microorganisms that may metabolize the target drugs. The novelty of this project lies in the ability to screen drug-metabolizing enzymes/microorganisms using multiple metrics and methods to increase the reliability of predictions to achieve the accuracy necessary for clinical and commercial use. This multi- method platform will be built, integrated, and validated in an iterative fashion using targeted in vitro experiments on two candidate drugs, i.e. the anti-arrhythmic drug amiodarone and the anti-viral drug famciclovir. This project is designed to both advance our current understanding of microbiome function in the context of drug-gut interactions as well as inform strategies to help enhance public health and economic growth. The value proposition of this project includes leveraging publicly available bioinformatics databases as well as advances in computational biology techniques to develop a more precise, reliable, and inexpensive tool for gut microbiome-mediated metabolism of therapeutic drugs. This in-silico platform could be employed for both current drugs as well as drugs under development. For current drugs, this platform can help increase the safety of drugs by predicting the mechanisms of efficacy and toxicity as they may differ from individual-to- individual. For new drugs, the platform would reduce the cost and timeframe of drug development, while increasing the effectiveness of the therapeutics themselves.

"Coupling Results Data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Bibliographic Databases to Accelerate Evidence Synthesis Project Summary Clinical trials are foundational to evidence-based medicine, but results reporting from trials is incomplete and frequently delayed. It is estimated that as many as half of clinical trials are not published and as many as half of published trials underreport or misreport outcomes. This type of results reporting distorts the evidence available to clinicians—particularly when it comes to assessing the safety of interventions like drugs and devices—and may place patients at unnecessary risk. There is a critical need for novel methods to identify and monitor drug safety data. Through the infrastructure provided by ClinicalTrials.gov, structured trial results (including safety findings) are now becoming available for an increasing number of trials in a comprehensive and timely fashion. However, access and use of these data in evidence synthesis tasks remain limited. ClinicalTrials.gov is the largest single registry for clinical studies worldwide and includes more than 260,000 registered studies. Of the 108,941 completed trials registered with the site, 20% have uploaded results data for a total of 7.85 million participants. Results data reported on ClinicalTrials.gov have the potential to fill gaps created by delays and biases in published articles and provide an earlier and more complete overview of available trial evidence. We propose to develop novel informatics approaches based on combinations of information retrieval and machine learning methods to facilitate access and analysis of trial results reported in this registry. Focusing on trials testing drug interventions in type 2 diabetes, obesity, and oncology, we perform this work in three specific aims: 1) Develop semi-automated trial screening for identifying and aggregating trials relevant to a clinical intervention; 2) Extract adverse event and safety outcomes data from results reported in the registry; and 3) Perform validation studies to assess detection of adverse events and performance of semi- automated meta-analyses of safety outcomes. Methods developed in this project will facilitate timely, broad- scale use of trial results reported on ClinicalTrials.gov in order to augment the availability of comprehensive and timely drug safety data. All methods will be made publicly available in order to support adverse event monitoring and systematic reviews of drug interventions. Project Narrative The availability of results from clinical trials is frequently incomplete or delayed, limiting the evidence available to clinicians making treatment decisions. When results on the safety of interventions, such as drugs, are not properly disseminated, patients may be exposed to harm. National policies require comprehensive and timely reporting of trial results in trial registries (e.g. ClinicalTrials.gov), representing a novel data type that could be used for drug safety surveillance. However, the use of these data has remained limited to date. We propose innovative informatics methods to enable access and analysis of this emerging data source in order to augment the availability of comprehensive and timely drug safety data.",Coupling Results Data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Bibliographic Databases to Accelerate Evidence Synthesis,10136717,R01LM012976,"['Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Bibliographic Databases', 'Bibliography', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consumption', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug usage', 'Equilibrium', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse event monitoring', 'base', 'cluster trial', 'concept mapping', 'design', 'drug testing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'medication safety', 'novel', 'rosiglitazone', 'safety outcomes', 'screening', 'supervised learning', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'trial design', 'validation studies', 'vector']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,328000,209484975
"A novel lncRNA-responsive and xenobiotic receptor-mediated regulation of drug metabolism and disposition A novel lncRNA-responsive and xenobiotic receptor-mediated regulation of drug metabolism and disposition Abstract Drug metabolism and disposition are essential xenobiotic responses. The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-coding RNAs larger than 200 nucleotides (nt) in length and do not have protein-coding potentials. Although many of the biological functions of lncRNAs have been recognized, it is unclear whether and how lncRNAs can regulate the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters and if so, whether the regulations are implicated in cancer chemo-resistance. Through integrative analysis of cancer non-coding genomic and high-through drug screening data of 505 cancer cell lines, our preliminary study have discovered and functionally characterized a group of ADME(drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) chemo-resistance lncRNAs, including LINC00992, whose up-regulation is associated with resistance to more than 100 chemotherapy compounds and may regulate drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters through interacting with xenobiotic nuclear receptor. We hypothesize that dysregulation of ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs is an important contributor for the development of cancer chemo-resistance. Mechanistically, ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs affect chemo-resistance through their regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters that are responsible for the metabolism and disposition of chemotherapy drugs. We propose three specific aims to test our hypotheses: In Aim 1, we will perform bioinformatic analysis and molecularly clone of lncRNAs associated with cancer chemo-resistance and clinical prognosis. In Aim 2: we will functional characterize of ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs, including LINC00992, using in vivo and in vitro cancer chemotherapy models. In Aim 3: we will determine the mechanism by which ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs, including LINC00992, regulate the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Chemotherapy remains a mainstay in the clinical management of cancer patients, but chemo-resistance is a major challenge to overcome. Understanding the novel lncRNA responsive and xenobiotic nuclear receptor- mediated chemo-resistance will help provide novel strategies to enhance therapeutic efficacy and avoid the development of chemo-resistance. Narrative The goal of this study is to reveal a novel lncRNA-responsive and xenobiotic receptor-mediated regulation of drug metabolism and disposition. Specifically, we propose to test the hypothesis that a group of novel lncRNAs, identified by our computational analysis and experimental validation, can affect chemo-resistance through their regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters that are responsible for the metabolism and disposition of chemotherapy drugs. Understanding the novel lncRNA responsive and xenobiotic nuclear receptor-mediated chemo-resistance will help provide novel strategies to enhance therapeutic efficacy and avoid the development of chemo-resistance.",A novel lncRNA-responsive and xenobiotic receptor-mediated regulation of drug metabolism and disposition,10096096,R01CA255196,"['Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Breast Cancer Cell', 'Cancer Cell Growth Regulation', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell physiology', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chemoresistance', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Code', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug Efflux', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Regulations', 'Drug Screening', 'Enzymes', 'Evolution', 'Excretory function', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Vitro', 'Length', 'Location', 'Luciferases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Cloning', 'Nuclear Receptors', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA analysis', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Regulation', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transfection', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'Xenobiotics', 'absorption', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'constitutive androstane receptor', 'crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'docetaxel', 'drug candidate', 'drug disposition', 'drug metabolism', 'gain of function', 'in vivo', 'knock-down', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'overexpression', 'pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics', 'pregnane X receptor', 'receptor', 'response', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'uptake']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,357994,570146095
"New Methods and Tools for Computational Drug Discovery Project Summary  My goal is to develop effective and efﬁcient computational methods for drug discovery, apply these methods to ﬁnd new and efﬁcacious drugs to treat diseases, and deploy these methods in easy-to-use open source tools. My research group pioneered the development and integration of deep neural networks in user-friendly molecular docking software for structure-based drug design to predict poses and potency of small molecules binding to their molecular targets. We will build on our foundational work by using deep learning to simultaneously solving the scoring and sampling problems, which will overcome scalability limitations inherent in current approaches.  We propose to develop the ﬁrst deep generative models for structure-based drug design. Unlike tra- ditional screening, generative modeling is not limited to a predeﬁned chemical space. In generative mod- eling, a deep neural network learns an underlying distribution of molecular structures and properties represented as a latent space. New structures can be extracted from this learned latent space to have desirable properties. Ideally, a generative model will produce novel, near-optimal molecular structures almost instantaneously. We hypothesize that training generative models using existing 3D protein and ligand structures will allow us to create general models that can be productively applied to new, struc- turally enabled targets due to the richness and universality of protein-ligand interactions. We will further develop these methods to support the generation of optimized lead candidates, where the generative process is updated to include results from experimental assays as the drug discovery process progresses.  We will continually apply our methods to identify small molecule modulators of molecular interac- tions relevant to normal physiology and disease. For example, using our current tools, we identiﬁed the ﬁrst inhibitors of the proﬁlin-actin interaction, an anti-angiogenesis target with relevance to cancer and diabetic retinopathy, and we plan to further improve these compounds with the goal of identifying candi- dates for clinical testing. We will apply our methods to address other under-explored molecular targets, such as NFATc2, which is implicated in cancer and autoimmune diseases. These prospective applications of our methods will provide unbiased and realistic evaluations that further inform their development.  Finally, all of our code and trained deep neural network models will be deployed either as new tools for generative modeling or as enhancements to our widely used open source tools for computational drug discovery: (1) PHARMIT, an interactive web application for structure-based drug discovery; (2) GNINA, a C/C++ deep learning framework for molecular docking; and (3) the newly released LIBMOLGRID, a Python library for accelerated molecular gridding that integrates with popular deep learning toolkits. These tools and methods will make the drug discovery process more accessible and efﬁcient. Project Narrative  The research supported by this award will develop new computational methods and tools for drug discovery so that novel therapeutics can be discovered more quickly and with less expense. The de- veloped methods will be evaluated prospectively in drug discovery projects of high relevance to human health.

"Mechanism-Driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway Modeling for Hepatotoxicity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Experimental animal and clinical testing to evaluate hepatotoxicity demands extensive resources and long turnaround times. Utilization of computational models to directly predict the toxicity of new compounds is a promising strategy to reduce the cost of drug development and to screen the multitude of industrial chemicals and environmental contaminants currently lacking safety assessments. However, the current computational models for complex toxicity endpoints, such as hepatotoxicity, are not reliable for screening new compounds and face numerous challenges. Our recent studies have shown that traditional Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship modeling is applicable for relatively simple properties or toxicity endpoints with a clear mechanism, but fails to address complex bioactivities such as hepatotoxicity. The primary objective of this proposal is to develop novel mechanism-driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway (vAOP) models for the fast and accurate assessment of hepatotoxicity in a high-throughput manner The resulting vAOP models will be experimentally validated using a complement of in vitro and ex vivo testing. We have generated a preliminary vAOP model based on the antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway that has undergone initial validation and refinement using in vitro testing. To this end, our project will generate novel predictive models for hepatotoxicity by applying 1) a virtual cellular stress pathway model to mechanism profiling and assessment of new compounds; 2) computational predictions to fill in the missing data for specific targets within the pathway; 3) in vitro experimental validation with three complementary bioassays; and 4) ex vivo experimental validation with pooled primary human hepatocytes capable of biochemical transformation. The scientific approach of this study is to develop a universal modeling workflow that can take advantage of all available short-term testing information, obtained from both computational predictions using novel machine learning approaches and in vitro experiments, for target compounds of interest. We will validate and use our modeling workflow to directly evaluate the hepatotoxicity of new compounds and prioritize candidates for validation in pooled primary human hepatocytes. The resulting workflow will be disseminated via a web portal for public users around the world with internet access. Importantly, this study will pave the way for the next generation of chemical toxicity assessment by reconstructing the modeling process through a combination of big data, computational modeling, and low cost in vitro experiments. To the best of our knowledge, the implementation of this project will lead to the first publicly available mechanisms-driven modeling and web- based prediction framework for complex chemical toxicity based on publicly-accessible big data. These deliverables will have a significant public health impact by not only prioritizing compounds for safety testing or new chemical development, but also revealing toxicity mechanisms.

"Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Summary:  Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients experience limited functional recovery, owing in part to the paucity of axon regrowth from injured CNS neurons. Effective treatments are lacking, likely because of multiple factors, intrinsic and extrinsic, that inhibit axon growth. Thus we require agents that target more than one source of regeneration failure.  Kinases are ubiquitous signal transducers that regulate most cellular processes, including axon growth. To begin to identify compounds that positively regulate axon growth, we screened 1600 small-molecule kinase inhibitors (KIs) in an in vitro CNS neurite outgrowth assay and identified “hit” KIs that reproducibly and strongly promote outgrowth. Due to homology of catalytic domains, KIs typically inhibit multiple kinases. This makes it difficult to identify the kinase(s) that mediate a KI's effects on cells. We used information theory and machine learning to analyze the inhibition profiles of KIs in relation to their effects on neurite outgrowth. This enabled us to identify, and later validate via siRNA knockdown in primary neurons, multiple kinase targets (i.e. kinases that should be inhibited to promote neurite outgrowth). These included previously known targets that regulate intrinsic and extrinsic inhibitor factors, in addition to several novel candidates. Conversely, we identified kinases whose activity is critical for neurite outgrowth, and whose inhibition must be avoided (anti-targets). We discovered several KIs that inhibit multiple targets and no anti-targets. These KIs strongly promoted neurite outgrowth in vitro.  We tested the KI, RO48, that had the largest effect in vitro in two in vivo models. Our preliminary experiments indicate that RO48 is remarkably effective in vivo. It promoted robust axonal growth of the corticospinal tract (CST) in three separate models of CST injury (pyramidotomy, funiculotomy, dorsal hemisection), and in the dorsal hemisection model, improved forelimb function. We propose to build on these remarkable results to test the working hypothesis that the simultaneous inhibition of RO48's five target kinases (ROCK, PKC, PRKG1, PRKX, and RPS6K) promotes sprouting and regeneration of CST axons. This will be accomplished using viral vectors to knock down expression of the different target kinases individually and in combination. We will do knockdown in CST neurons in the cortex. We will assess CST axon growth at the injury site using light microscopy. We will also perform experiments to determine if RO48-induced CST axon growth promotes axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and whether RO48 improves behavioral outcomes such as grasping and walking after a contusion injury.  These experiments will 1) validate novel kinases as in vivo targets for future development of SCI therapeutics 2) determine whether these kinases regulate CST axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and 3) confirm whether the substantial stimulation of axon growth induced by treatment with RO48 improves motor outcomes in a clinically relevant contusion model.  Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Narrative: The proposed experiments aim to understand how small-molecule drug-like compounds increase the ability of nerve cells to grow long processes and re-form connections. Validating the molecular targets of these compounds for in vivo nerve growth will enable future drug discovery projects focused on these targets.",Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury,10160972,R01NS100531,"['Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cervical', 'Complement 5a', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Control Animal', 'Contusions', 'Corticospinal Tracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Dorsal', 'Dose', 'Failure', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery of Function', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Spinal cord injury patients', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transducers', 'Viral Vector', 'Walking', 'axon growth', 'axon regeneration', 'axonal sprouting', 'behavior test', 'behavioral outcome', 'central nervous system injury', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'injured', 'insight', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knock-down', 'light microscopy', 'novel', 'reconstruction', 'regenerative', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'targeted agent', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,465464,157845771
"Validation of an in vitro model of progressive fibrosis that mimics Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Abstract We have developed a 3D bioengineered human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived model of IPF that displays progressive fibrosis and closely phenocopies several characteristics associated with IPF. This model is an extension of our 2D model of progressive fibrosis (Vijayaraj et al., Cell Reports – in press).

To validate the 3D model of IPF by performing extensive characterization of the model compared to human  IPF lung tissue. B. To characterize the heterogeneity of IPF seen across different patients. C. To characterize the 3D IPF model by known genetic risk factors. Specific Aim 2 – To use our 3D bioengineered iPSC-derived model to study cellular plasticity in IPF To profile cellular plasticity of AECs in our 3D model of IPF and compare it to human IPF tissue using single cell RNA sequencing.

"In silico safety pharmacology PROJECT SUMMARY: A major factor plaguing drug development is that there is no drug-screening tool that can distinguish between drugs that will induce cardiac arrhythmias from chemically similar safe drugs. The current approaches rely on substitute markers such as action potential duration or QT interval prolongation on the ECG. There is an urgent need to identify a new approach that can predict actual proarrhythmia from the drug chemistry rather than relying on surrogate indicators. We have brought together an expert team to innovate at the interfaces of experimental and computational modeling disciplines and develop an in silico simulation pipeline to predict cardiotoxicity over multiple temporal and spatial scales from the atom to the cardiac rhythm. An essential and unique aspect of our approach is that we propose to utilize atomistic scale simulation to predict the transition rates of ion channels and adrenergic receptors and how they are modified by drug interaction. We hypothesize that it is the subtleties of these interactions that are likely to be the critical determinants of drug associated safety or proarrhythmia. In the last award period, we successfully developed an unprecedented linkage: We connected the highly disparate space and time scales of ion channel structure and function. We utilized atomistic simulation to compute drug kinetic rates were directly used as parameters in a hERG function model. The model components were then integrated into predictive models at the cell and tissue scales to expose fundamental arrhythmia vulnerability mechanisms and complex interactions underlying emergent behaviors. Human clinical data were used for model validation and showed excellent agreement, demonstrating feasibility of this new approach for cardiotoxicity prediction. In this renewal application we propose to hugely extend this approach to include prediction of the interaction of cardiac channel gating and drug interaction as well as the inclusion of adrenergic receptor interactions with drugs. Another essential aspect of safety pharmacology is the development of new approaches to allow more efficient drug design, screening and prediction of cardiotoxicity. Therefore, we will seek to develop, extend and apply a variety of machine learning and deep learning approaches to improve drug discovery by predicting proarrhythmia from the drug chemistry with an efficient process that identify drug congeners via machine learning to maximize therapy and minimize side effects. Finally, we propose to classify drugs into categories based on proarrhythmia risk in normal and diseased virtual tissue settings. The multiscale model for prediction of cardiopharmacology that we will develop in this application will be applied to projects demonstrating its usefulness for efficacy or toxicity of drug treatments in the complex physiological system of the heart. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Cardiotoxicity in the form of deadly abnormal rhythms is one of the most common and dangerous risks for drugs in development. There is an urgent need for new approaches to accurately screen and predict the effects of drugs on cardiac rhythms.

"National Drug Early Warning System Coordinating Center PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our team enthusiastically submits this proposal to be the next NDEWS Coordinating Center (CC) in response to RFA DA-20-016. The CC is spearheaded by the Cottler Lab (Epidemiology), with investigators from University of Florida's Center for Addiction Research & Education (Nixon, Goldberger, Striley), the Palamar Lab at New York University and the Machine Perception and Cognitive Robotics Lab-Barenholtz) at Florida Atlantic University. Our CC will maintain strong sentinel surveillance efforts while expanding our Early Warning Network sites, adding leading edge indicators that extend beyond lagged city-level data. We will extend the work of NIDA-funded researchers, while harmonizing and analyzing data, with timely and systematic notifications. The new NDEWS CC will work to seamlessly transition on-going efforts, advance methods and approaches, establish and engage a Scientific Advisory Group (SAG), and collaborate with all consortium components to accomplish these Specific Aims: 1) Provide an Early Warning Network of 12 NDEWS sites and 6 Community Epidemiology Workgroup sites for ongoing surveillance of urban, rural, and suburban areas; 2) Utilize established and new key community-level indicators for ongoing surveillance to assess trends in availability, use, and consequences of NPS and known substances, standardized across all sites to facilitate cross-site analyses; 3) Incorporate and leverage novel surveillance methods to ensure early detection of signals of NPS and emerging drug trends, including data from DanceSafe “drug checkers,” Rapid Street Reporting (RSR) with hair testing for NPS exposure, the implementation of a virtual HealthStreet substance user network, and development of an innovative machine learning approach to detect emergence of NPS in real-time through drug retailers (including the “darknet”) and social media platforms; 4) Harmonize standardized indicator definitions for all incoming surveillance data with the input of NIDA, the SAG, and Early Warning Network experts; facilitate cross-site comparability of data; manage quality control; organize, coordinate, and summarize data, and provide organizational and logistical support; 5) Disseminate findings quickly via dashboards modeled after Florida Drug-related Outcomes Surveillance and Tracking System (FROST); push notifications for regular updates and alerts; webinars; virtual Our Community Our Health Town Hall meetings; and traditionally through official reports, peer-reviewed publications, media, and annual reporting at CPDD, and elsewhere; 6) Conduct on-the-ground epidemiologic investigations on topics of immediate crisis or need; 7) Provide operational, administrative, and logistical support to the enterprise and NIDA; and 8) Train the next generation of scientists in NDEWS methodology.  NDEWS has unrealized potential, and with this funding, we will transform the culture so that NDEWS is NIDA's and the field's go-to source for drug trends in the US. It will provide evidence-based prevention and intervention strategies to eventually reduce the harmful effects of substance use around the world.

"Novel deep learning strategy to better predict pharmacological properties of candidate drugs and focus discovery efforts PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to continue development of a novel approach based on deep learning neural networks to encode molecules into chemically rich vectors. In Phase 1 we demonstrated that this representation enables computational models that more accurately predict the chemical properties of molecules than state-of-the-art models, yet are also far simpler to build because they do not require any expert decisions or optimization to achieve high performance. In Phase 2 we will exploit this unprecedented simplicity to develop an intuitive software package that will for the first time enable any chemist or biologist working in drug discovery to create and run their own predictive models – without relying on specialized cheminformatics expertise – yet still achieve or exceed the accuracy of the best currently available techniques. Scientists engaged in drug discovery research from academic laboratories to large pharmaceutical companies rely on computational QSAR models to predict pharmacologically relevant properties and obviate the need to perform expensive, time-consuming assays (many of which require animal studies) for every molecule of interest. Improved models will enable researchers to select lead candidate series more effectively, explore chemical space around leads to generate novel IP more efficiently, reduce failure rates for compounds advancing through the drug discovery pipeline, and accelerate the entire drug discovery process. These benefits will be realized broadly across most therapeutic areas.  We also plan to take the technology one step further, leveraging our chemically rich vector representation to enable the software to creatively suggest novel compounds (which do not appear in the training libraries, screening libraries, or lead series) that outperform the lead candidates simultaneously on bioactivity, ADME/Tox and PK assays . Solving this inverse problem is the Holy Grail of computational medicinal chemistry and has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to understand whether potential new drugs are likely to be both safe and effective, and identify similar compounds that are likely to be safer and more effective against the same target.

"A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis PROJECT SUMMARY This project will address the critical need for new and effective antitubercular drugs. Our primary objective is to elucidate the mechanisms by which Mycobacterium tuberculosis tolerates antitubercular drug treatment. Our motivating hypothesis is that M. tuberculosis tolerates drug induced stress by differentially regulating detoxification enzymes, efflux pumps, metabolic activity, pellicle-forming factors, and cell wall remodeling systems. Further, we postulate that a secondary drug targeting one or few regulators of these tolerance strategies will potentiate the primary drug-treatment, and potentially reduce the emergence of resistance. We propose a systems biology approach to generate a network perspective of drug-induced tolerance mechanisms and how they are coordinated by one or few regulators that could be targeted for overcoming drug-specific tolerance using combinatorial treatment regimens. Hence, the innovation of our proposed research emerges from integrating network characterization of drug- specific tolerance mechanisms into the rational discovery of novel drug combinations. In Aim 1, we will transcriptionally profile M. tuberculosis following treatment with ten selected drugs (primary drugs). Using techniques developed in our laboratory, differentially expressed genes will be mapped onto a systems-scale gene regulatory network model of M. tuberculosis to infer drug-specific tolerance sub-networks and elucidate key regulators. We will also identify tolerance sub-networks by generating genome-wide fitness profiles in the presence of the selected primary drugs. Drug-associated fitness defects will reveal genes that are important for dealing with drug-induced stress and are hypothesized to cluster together in drug-specific tolerance sub-networks. In Aim 2, we will transcriptionally profile ~250 secondary drugs and perform combination high-throughput screens of all primary and secondary drug combinations. Data from these studies will be used to iteratively refine the model and develop a machine learning algorithm to identify gene- and network-level features that are predictive of synergistic drug interactions. Finally, mechanism of synergistic drug combinations will be characterized by selectively perturbing the predicted regulators of the tolerance sub-networks. This project will propel the development of systems biology tools to accurately predict novel synergistic drug combinations, thereby guiding experimental assessment and accelerating the delivery of new treatments to patients with tuberculosis infection. PROJECT NARRATIVE Treatment of tuberculosis infection (responsible for 1.5 million deaths annually) is complicated by the impermeable cell wall structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its intrinsic ability to adapt and withstand drug treatment, a phenomenon called tolerance. Thus, an urgent goal of antitubercular drug discovery is to overcome drug tolerance. This project will deepen our understanding of how M. tuberculosis responds to and thereby tolerates drug treatment and will use this systems-scale understanding to develop a predictive framework for identifying new synergistically acting drug combinations for the treatment of tuberculosis.",A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis,10059161,R01AI128215,"['Address', 'Antitubercular Agents', 'Cell Wall', 'Cessation of life', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Enzymes', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tuberculosis', 'combinatorial', 'differential expression', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'fitness', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'response', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transposon sequencing', 'treatment response', 'tuberculosis drugs', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2021,913527,10159852
"Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The percent of Gram-negative bacterial infections that are resistant to common antibiotics has increased at an alarming rate over the last decade, and there is now an acute need for the discovery of novel antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. The standard method of antibacterial discovery – whole- cell screening of compound collections – has met with repeated failure for Gram-negatives, and these failures have been traced to the fact that very few compounds in standard collections can penetrate the Gram-negative cell membranes and accumulate in these pathogens. Unfortunately, there has been scant information about the types of compounds that are competent for accumulation in Gram-negatives. Excitingly, we recently assessed a unique collection of >180 diverse compounds for their ability to accumulate in E. coli, trained a random forest classification model to analyze the results, and from this data we identified physicochemical properties important for accumulation and developed predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in E. coli. We then showed the utility of these guidelines by converting a Gram-positive-only antibiotic into a broad-spectrum agent. We now propose to develop tools that will allow us to fully define the physicochemical traits that enable compounds accumulation in three of the most concerning Gram-negative bacteria, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), drug-resistant Acinetobacter, and drug-resistant P. aeruginosa (to be referred to collectively as EAP pathogens). Specifically, we seek to develop novel tools in the area of chemical probes (compound collections), bacterial strains, and computational models. Using these tools in conjunction with our well-validated compound accumulation assay, we intend to define the physicochemical traits needed for compound accumulation in the EAP pathogens, including assessment of the influence of porins and efflux pumps, and the relative contribution of the outer and inner-membranes to blocking compound penetrance. Our predictive guidelines will be utilized to convert several high-value Gram-positive-only compounds into broad- spectrum antibiotics. PROJECT NARRATIVE It has been 50 years since the approval of a new class of drugs effective against Gram-negative bacteria, and as such, there are now limited treatment options for drug-resistant Gram-negative infections. This paucity of drugs can be directly traced to the lack of understanding about the types of compounds that can accumulate inside these bacteria. Herein we propose a comprehensive and systematic plan to develop predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in the most problematic drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pathogens, and to use this information to develop general strategies to convert Gram-positive-only compounds into broad-spectrum antibiotics.",Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics,10087862,R01AI136773,"['Acinetobacter', 'Acute', 'Amines', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug usage', 'Escherichia coli', 'Failure', 'Fusidic Acid', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Literature', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Publications', 'Resistance', 'Scientist', 'Training', 'VDAC1 gene', 'Variant', 'World Health Organization', 'carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'efflux pump', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional group', 'novel', 'novel drug class', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'screening', 'simulation', 'tool', 'trait']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2021,1140875,76545728
"Development of a metabolomics and machine learning based high-throughput screening platform for data-driven drug discovery Project Summary High-throughput omics technologies allow for measuring various biomolecules comprehensively and over the past decade have become exponentially less expensive. Coupling these emerging technologies with automation approaches and the phenotypic-based drug discovery paradigm allows for data-driven drug discovery (D4). D4 focuses on a complete cellular readout, quantitatively measuring 100s to 100,000s of biomolecules or cellular features, rather than focusing on a single protein, pathway, or physiological trait. The complexity of this data requires computational tools for proper analysis and interpretation. In Phase I of this proposal, we combined the dual strengths of experts in LC-MS/MS based metabolomics (Omix Technologies) with leaders in metabolomics data analysis (Sinopia Biosciences) to develop a metabolomics based high-throughput screening platform. We screened ~250 FDA approved small molecules from a broad range of drug classes on two cell lines. This dataset was compared to a matching dataset from the pioneering project for D4, the Connectivity Map, which is a transcriptomics screening and query platform for drug characterization, discovery, and repositioning. In Phase I, we observed that from both a technical and biological utility standpoint, the metabolomics data provided an orthogonal dataset with signal fidelity, sensitivity, and relevance to compound properties comparable to or exceeding the Connectivity Map. Further, we saw high concordance of plasma metabolite changes in type 2 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis patients with in vitro metabolite changes of related drugs used for those indications. Thus, these results suggest that a metabolomics based high-throughput screening platform is not only viable as a complementary dataset to the Connectivity Map, but that metabolomics data can even play a primary role in drug discovery. In this Phase II proposal, we will focus on profiling chemical and genetic perturbations in vitro to further demonstrate the power of the platform and identify commercial opportunities for treating genetically defined rare diseases. We will expand data generation to ~3300 bioactive compounds across three cell lines. Further, we will profile 50 genetic knockouts on those three cell lines to model in vitro the associated rare diseases. Using Sinopia’s platform, we will select compounds for follow-up evaluation to identify candidates that correct for metabolic dysregulations seen in those rare diseases. Successful in vitro programs will aid in seeding of an early stage discovery pipeline that will be advanced through funding by private investment, patient advocacy groups, and additional federal grants. Project Narrative Data-driven drug discovery provides the potential to accelerate drug development timelines, decrease costs, and ultimately provide better care to patients. Combining Sinopia Bioscience’s and Omix Technologies strengths in high-throughput data generation and analysis, we have built a unique platform focused on understanding the use of metabolomics in drug discovery. This proposal will apply the discovery engine on several rare genetic diseases with significant unmet needs.",Development of a metabolomics and machine learning based high-throughput screening platform for data-driven drug discovery,10143935,R44GM130268,"['Age', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Sciences', 'Capital', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug usage', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Grant', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Investments', 'Knock-out', 'Libraries', 'MCF7 cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Privatization', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Transcript', 'base', 'chemical genetics', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug mechanism', 'drug repurposing', 'follow-up', 'high throughput screening', 'in vitro Model', 'insulin sensitizing drugs', 'interest', 'metabolomics', 'molecular phenotype', 'patient advocacy group', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'rare genetic disorder', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'trait', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,"SINOPIA BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2021,1335997,754478
