"Direct Determination of Multiple Specific Forms of DNA Chemical Modifications in Human Genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The information content of DNA is not limited to the primary sequence (A, C, G, T), but is also conveyed by chemical modifications of individual bases. For example, DNA methylation, specifically 5-methylcytosine (5mC), has been widely studied for its important regulatory roles in human development and diseases. In addition, the discovery of active demethylation of 5mC, mediated by TET enzymes, into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) revealed great insights into the dynamic nature of the human methylome and its close relevance to multiple human diseases. Beyond these chemical modifications to cytosine, recent studies by us and others discovered that N6-methyladenine (6mA), another form of methylation previously thought exclusively existing in bacteria and protozoa, also exists in eukaryotic genomes including the human genome. In addition to these epigenetic marks, different forms of DNA damages represent another category of DNA chemical modifications that are of important biological relevance. Although a few methods for mapping individual chemical modifications have been developed and some are widely used, it is usually hard for broad researchers to master every protocol to map each form of modification. While third- generation sequencing technologies support the direct detection of DNA modifications, they face fundamental challenges distinguishing among different forms of modifications. The objective of this project is to develop a novel technology for the direct mapping of multiple forms of DNA methylation and DNA damage events simultaneously. The core idea is that each form of nucleic acid modification has a unique signature in terms of their physical interaction with DNA polymerase, or nanopores in third-generation sequencing; and these signatures can be modeled by deep learning methods. We will develop this technology using multiple innovative strategies to address a few fundamental challenges, and then comprehensively evaluate the technology to facilitate broad applications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chemical DNA modifications are crucial components of human genome that controls many important biological processes in human development and human diseases. In this project, we will develop a novel technology for direct mapping of multiple and specific forms of DNA modifications, which will enable us and a large number of researchers to more effectively study the functions of DNA modifications in human genome.",Direct Determination of Multiple Specific Forms of DNA Chemical Modifications in Human Genome,10204438,R01HG011095,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Process', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Face', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Human Development', 'Human Genome', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Individual', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Performance', 'Ploidies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protozoa', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Technology', 'Third Generation Sequencing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cancer risk', 'cell type', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'demethylation', 'exome', 'experience', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'methylome', 'nanopore', 'network models', 'new technology', 'prototype', 'sequencing platform', 'single molecule', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,833051
"Pan-disease characterization of DNA methylation dysregulation DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark with a regulated pattern in healthy tissues. Disruption of this pattern, called methylation dysregulation, has been reported in many diseases including cancer, autoimmune diseases, metabolic and psychological disorders, and diseases related to aging. Importantly, methylation dysregulation has been observed in pre-disease states and the degree of dysregulation correlates with disease severity and also response to treatment. These observations compel the study of methylation dysregulation because it may reveal common origins of human disease, and because genomic elements (e.g. genes, mutations, and regulatory features) associated with methylation dysregulation may be potential targets for diagnostic and early intervention therapies. However, the genomic elements that control and maintain methylation dysregulation have not been well-characterized. Understanding the mechanisms and pathways that are responsible for the establishment of epigenetic dysregulation is critical for understanding the establishment of the disease phenotype in general. We hypothesize that specific genomic elements could contribute to methylation dysregulation in reproducible ways across diseases. This research seeks to identify genomic elements that may initiate a disease state that is common across multiple diseases. This will be accomplished by the development of computational algorithms to leverage and integrate patient samples from many diseases, as well as the development of a new high-throughput genomic screen. Specifically, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Identification of genes associated with methylation dysregulation using a pan-disease machine-learning approach; (2) Exploration of the contribution of the noncoding genome to methylation dysregulation through analysis of  genome variants and chromatin accessibility data; (3) Development and validation of a novel CRISPR screen to link gene perturbations to methylation  landscapes in a high-throughput manner. In summary, completion of these aims will produce an in-depth characterization of the genomic elements associated with methylation dysregulation, leading to understanding of the processes and mechanisms of epigenetic dysregulation. More broadly, the proposed analysis framework and computational approach will explore the utility of integrative pan-disease studies to identify common characteristics of disease which could lead to diagnostic and therapeutic solutions. This proposal takes advantage of the applicant's expertise in genetics, genomics, and high-throughput assays. It also includes training and research experience in experimental design and execution which will advance the candidate's goal of becoming an independent research scientist capable of investigating genome function, specifically the genomic origins of human disease. DNA methylation patterns are dysregulated in many human diseases, suggesting that elements of disease initiation may be common across diseases. The proposed research aims to characterize pan-disease patterns of methylation dysregulation and to identify genes and regulators that lead to methylation dysregulation. This will contribute to fundamental knowledge of disease initiation and identify potential targets for disease diagnosis and treatment.",Pan-disease characterization of DNA methylation dysregulation,10191781,K99HG011658,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR screen', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methylation Regulation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Experimental Designs', 'Fingerprint', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease phenotype', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'genome analysis', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'large datasets', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'treatment response']",NHGRI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K99,2021,170402

Project Narrative Genomic and epigenomic abnormalities collaborate in disease initiation and progression, as exempliﬁed by frequent mutations in protein-coding genes which can vary spatially in separated sub-regions of tissues. This project will develop computational methods to infer tissue-spatial epigenomic landscape which can not be measured using current techniques, leveraging the emerging technologies of spatial transcriptomics, and develop novel statistical methods to identify differential epigenomic signals across patients or cell populations. The outcome of this project can lead to the development of new epigenetic targeted therapy and new epigenetic therapeutic drugs for various diseases that helps the broad community.",Computational Methods for Inferring Single-cell DNA Methylation and its Spatial Landscape,10104023,K99HG011468,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Biometry', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Encyclopedia of DNA Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hong Kong', 'Human', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Promoter Regions', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health Schools', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Variant', 'Work', 'career', 'career development', 'cell type', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'disease classification', 'disorder prevention', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'programs', 'reference genome', 'single cell analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,115909
"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,10093062,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,393339
"Unbiased identification and characterization of mouse metastable epialleles PROJECT SUMMARY (Abstract) In addition to genetics and environment, interindividual variation in epigenetic regulation may determine risk of obesity. Exceptional genomic loci called metastable epialleles offer unprecedented opportunities to test this. Metastable epialleles – essentially epigenetic polymorphisms – exhibit interindividual variation in DNA methylation that is neither tissue-specific nor genetically mediated. Metastable epialleles were first discovered in mice when dramatic phenotypic variation was observed amongst inbred mice. Over the last 10 years we pioneered the discovery and characterization of human metastable epialleles. We have shown that DNA methylation profiling of multiple tissues in multiple individuals is an effective approach to identifying regions that exhibit systemic interindividual variation in DNA methylation, a hallmark of metastable epialleles. Now that we know epigenetic metastability is common to mice and humans, it is essential to identify and explore the full range of MEs in the mouse. We therefore propose to pursue the following Specific Aims: Aim 1 - Perform an unbiased screen for mouse metastable epialleles. Aim 2 - Test for effects of maternal dietary methyl donor supplementation on offspring DNA methylation at metastable epialleles. Aim 3: Use comparative genomics to identify sequence determinants of epigenetic metastability. Successful completion of these Aims will provide the foundation for development of mouse (and potentially other mammalian) models which will enable controlled experiments to help understand how interindividual variation in DNA methylation affects risk of disease in humans. PROJECT NARRATIVE (Relevance Statement) Just as individual genetic variation can affect risk of disease, so too can individual epigenetic variation. In particular, special genomic regions called metastable epialleles, which were first discovered in mice, offer the best opportunities to advance our understanding of epigenetic etiology of disease because their systemic nature means that – like genetic polymorphisms – they can be assessed in any easily obtainable tissue sample, such as peripheral blood. Now that we know that metastable epialleles also exist in humans, we urgently need to develop a more complete catalog of these genomic regions in the mouse, to enable well- controlled experiments to advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of interindividual epigenetic variation at these loci.",Unbiased identification and characterization of mouse metastable epialleles,10190936,R01DK125562,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Assisted Reproductive Technology', 'Base Sequence', 'Beds', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Cleft Palate', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA methylation profiling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Dietary Supplementation', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Germ Layers', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Inbred Mouse', 'Individual', 'Individuality', 'Intracisternal A-Particle Elements', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methylation', 'Micronutrients', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Paper', 'Phenotype', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrotransposon', 'Seminal', 'Supplementation', 'Tail', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Variant', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'catalyst', 'cell type', 'comparative genomics', 'critical period', 'dietary', 'disorder risk', 'early pregnancy', 'embryo culture', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenetic variation', 'experimental study', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'inter-individual variation', 'metabolic phenotype', 'mother nutrition', 'mouse development', 'mouse genome', 'mouse model', 'nonhuman primate', 'nutrition', 'obesity risk', 'offspring', 'peripheral blood', 'transgenerational epigenetic inheritance']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,462430
"Epigenetic Mechanisms of Memory Storage Project Summary / Abstract In the hours after learning, the activation of gene expression follows a specific pattern, producing transient waves of expression needed for long-term memory consolidation. These changes require non-genetic (i.e., “epigenetic”) events, including modifications to: DNA-organizing proteins known as histones, the DNA itself, and the accessibility of DNA to proteins. Additionally, the molecular changes necessary for memory require a form of RNA-based regulation. In the absence of such changes, the long-lasting regulation of gene expression during memory storage fails, and this could account for defects in memory that accompany many psychiatric disorders. Our long-term goal is to define novel epigenetic mechanisms underlying memory storage and synaptic plasticity by taking advantage of recent advances in our understanding of histone modifications, in the development of single-cell RNA technology, and in the function of regulatory mechanisms mediated by small noncoding RNAs. During the previous funding period, we defined a novel metabolic source of acetyl-CoA in the nucleus and have obtained preliminary data about new forms of histone acylation and crotonylation associated with spatial learning. We also developed bioinformatic tools to analyze single nuclear RNA sequencing data to identify neurons activated by learning. We further established the reversal of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated mRNA silencing as a novel epigenetic means of regulating activity-dependent translation, linking synaptic activity to translational upregulation of key memory-related targets. These major findings provide the basis of our proposed experiments that we believe will define the next frontiers in our understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms of memory consolidation. In Specific Aim 1, we will examine the impact of a novel histone modification, histone crotonylation, on the epigenetic landscape and gene expression during memory consolidation. In Specific Aim 2, we will define cell type-specific transcriptional signatures of the hippocampal neurons during memory consolidation and retrieval. In Specific Aim 3, we will elucidate the microRNA- dependent mechanisms that regulate long-term memory and synaptic plasticity driven by a microRNA processing complex. An understanding of these key epigenetic regulatory mechanisms involved in the consolidation and storage of long-term memories is expected to ultimately lead to the development of new treatments for the debilitating cognitive deficits associated with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. Project Narrative The regulation of specific genes critical to the storage of memories (“memory consolidation”) and changes in neuronal function (“plasticity”) vital for learning are controlled by a number of mechanisms that are not themselves regulated by genetics. We propose to determine the functional roles of such epigenetic processes in memory consolidation and plasticity, and to define the sets of genes that are activated, in individual cells, during memory consolidation. This research promises to provide information that will be critical to the development of novel therapeutics capable of alleviating the cognitive deficits underlying many psychiatric disorders.",Epigenetic Mechanisms of Memory Storage,10211384,R01MH087463,"['ATAC-seq', 'Acetyl Coenzyme A', 'Acetylation', 'Acyl Coenzyme A', 'Acylation', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Coenzyme A', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Histone Acetylation', 'Histones', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nuclear RNA', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Ribonucleases', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translational Derepression', 'Translational Regulation', 'Translational Repression', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'epigenetic regulation', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'long term memory', 'memory consolidation', 'memory retrieval', 'new therapeutic target', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,740506
"DNA 3.0: Developing novel enzymes for DNA synthesis with deep learning and combinatorial genetics Project Summary/Abstract  DNA synthesis has played a key role in the biotechnology revolution. The ready availability of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides and of genes assembled from them, has been invaluable for elucidating and unlocking biological function and enabling the new field of synthetic biology which can create novel cells, enzymes, therapeutics, diagnostics and other reagents of commercial value. Despite this impact, DNA synthesis uses chemical strategies developed over 30 years ago which are costly and limited to molecules of 200 nucleotides or less in length.  Next-generation enzymatic DNA synthesis technologies are being explored that use template- independent DNA polymerases (TIDPs) for controlled addition of nucleotides to a growing DNA strand. Although advances have been reported recently, enzymatic DNA synthesis is still limited by the low efficiency of available TIDPs, and specifically by the relative inability of these polymerases to incorporate 3'-blocked nucleotides.  In this Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project, Primordial Genetics Inc, a synthetic biology company with differentiated combinatorial genetic technology, and Denovium Inc., an artificial intelligence company pioneering novel Al methods for genetic discovery, are joining forces to develop novel and highly efficient TIDPs for enzymatic DNA synthesis in vitro.  Denovium will use their computational capabilities based on machine learning algorithms to discover novel TIDPs with the desired activities from proprietary and public databases. Denovium will also perform proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) scans to determine the functional impact of all possible mutations on the selected TIDPs. Primordial Genetics will synthesize and express the resulting collection of sequences, and test them in vitro to identify the most active enzymes. The best 2 enzymes will be diversified using Primordial Genetics' proprietary Function Generator technology and other randomized diversification methods. Populations of genes encoding enzyme variants will be screened with ultra-high-throughput screens to identify the most active enzymes. The dataset resulting from this work will be used to train Denovium's sequence prediction algorithm to accelerate further enzyme improvements in Phase II.  The proposed work is a feasibility study for isolating and developing novel enzymes suitable for enzymatic DNA synthesis, and also for creating a pipeline of enzyme optimization tools. The enzymes discovered and in this work will be directly useful for enzymatic DNA synthesis applications, and can be licensed or sold to leading DNA and gene manufaturers. Project Narrative The principal aim of this project is to develop novel and improved DNA polymerases for the industrial synthesis of DNA, which is currently performed by synthetic chemical methods and represents one of the cornerstone technologies of the biotechnology industry. To overcome limitations of the current chemical technology in cost, efficiency and the length of DNA molecules that can be synthesized, there have been widespread attempts to develop specific DNA polymerases as efficient molecular machines for synthesizing DNA. This project will develop novel and more efficient polymerases than are currently available, which will impact the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of human diseases such as cancer, heart disease, HIV and genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis.",DNA 3.0: Developing novel enzymes for DNA synthesis with deep learning and combinatorial genetics,10304760,R43HG010995,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Process', 'Biotechnology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Enzymes', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'HIV', 'Heart Diseases', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Length', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Molecular Machines', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'genetic technology', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'synthetic biology', 'synthetic construct', 'tool']",NHGRI,"PRIMORDIAL GENETICS, INC",R43,2021,52000
"Molecular images and machine learning to extract placental function from maternal cfDNA Abstract  Circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) has revolutionized prenatal diagnostics, but this is the tip of the iceberg, as cfDNA fragmentation patterns embed epigenetic footprints indicative of cell of origin, cellular function and pathological state. cfDNA is fragmented with sizes centered around 145bp and 166bp which is approximately the length of DNA wrapped around a nucleosome, and a nucleosome plus its linker, respectively. Shorter fragments (30-100bp) also exist and have a clear periodicity of 10bp, corresponding to a turn of the DNA helix wrapped around the core histone. Recent reports have shown that the fragmentation sizes of cfDNA are tissue specific, which is a product of distinct nucleosome spacing that is inherent in the function of individual tissues. When these individual fragments are compared with existing epigenetic data from tissues, they can be binned into cell of origin simply based on whether they reveal the nucleosome positioning information of the originating tissue. Identifying cfDNA fragments of placental origin from maternal circulation would provide a non-invasive means of assessing placental function during human pregnancy.  Several major barriers inhibit cfDNA as a non-invasive method for examining placental function: 1) the ability to accurately identify the placental origin of the short <160bp cfDNA fragments that constitute regulatory information (paternal SNPs occur at frequency of approximately 1/2000bp). 2) the ability to use these fragments to piece together precise epigenetic states of the placenta. 3) the cost of deep whole genome sequencing that has traditionally been required to deconvolute epigenetic profiles of admixed cellular origins. Our goal is to overcome each of these barriers by exploiting state-of-the-art genomics and machine learning techniques to extract precise information about human placental function from cfDNA. We will first compile robust and accurate nucleosome information, including epigenetic and transcription factor occupancy, from the human placenta and then we will establish machine-learning platforms to elucidate placental cfDNA from maternal circulation at low cost. Success in this project will enable earlier intervention for high-risk pregnancies and facilitate the longitudinal, non-invasive real-time monitoring of pregnancy progression, thereby informing adaptive treatment decision-making. Narrative Circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) has revolutionized prenatal diagnostics, but this is the tip of the iceberg, as cfDNA fragmentation patterns embed epigenetic footprints indicative of cell of origin, cellular function and pathological state.

"Computational modeling of DNA methylation-mediated gene regulation Abstract Large numbers of complete methylomes are being acquired through clinical sequencing projects, such as through The Cancer Genome Atlas, Blueprint Epigenome Project, and International Cancer Genome Consortium. Furthermore, third-generation nanopore sequencers, which detect DNA methylation and genetic variation in a single experiment, are nearly ready for routine clinical sequencing and will provide complete methylomes for all patients where whole-genome sequencing is indicated. Current analysis tools however only perform preliminary methylome processing and catalogue differentially methylated regions (DMRs). In order to transform methylome analysis into a clinically useful diagnostic/prognostic test, we need to develop predictive tools to interpret the functional and pathological consequences of identified methylation changes. Towards this goal, we have published a series of papers demonstrating that machine-learning based models utilizing high- resolution signatures of all methylation changes around a promoter vastly outperform conventional DMR methods. Our models accurately predict expression states at genes potentially regulated by methylation and reveal predictive methylation signatures that facilitate mechanistic interpretation. Nonetheless, several challenges remain before we can achieve our goals of translating genome-wide methylation data for routine clinical use: (1) To our knowledge, no current models integrate distal enhancers, whose activation is affected by DNA methylation. Such integrative analysis is necessary to understand consequences of methylation changes in cancers, whose genomes frequently undergo wide-spread methylation changes. In addition, such modelling will be essential to understand the role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which may play both repressive and activating roles in neurons depending on whether it is found at promoters or enhancers. (2) Our current models (and conventional approaches) represent methylation data independent of DNA sequence despite mechanistic studies demonstrating that methylation changes can have different functional effects depending on which sequences change and depending on the context of the local regulatory grammar. In this proposal, we will meet these challenges by first developing a predictive model that incorporates 5-methylcytosine and 5hmC at promoters and enhancers to determine how these marks act in concert. In particular, we will examine the hypothesized dual role of 5hmC as a repressor at promoters and as an activator at enhancers in cortical neurons. We will then use new advances in natural language processing to model DNA sequence and methylation to predict expression states. Our results will reveal which regulatory elements and transcription factors binding sites are affected by DNA methylation and how changes at different sites collaborate to affect expression changes. We will experimentally validate our in silico predictions using a combination of reporter assays and CRISPR- based epigenome-editing tools. Thus, the software tools we develop will form an important toolkit for the analysis and mechanistic interpretation of whole-genome methylation studies, both in the laboratory and clinic. Public Narrative DNA normally undergoes a variety of chemical modifications including the addition of methyl- and hydroxymethyl- groups to cytosines (DNA methylation). Though we are unsure how to interpret them, abnormal patterns of DNA methylation are often found in human diseases and will likely soon be routinely measured in the clinic. In this proposal, we will develop advanced computational approaches to predict the functional and pathological consequences of DNA methylation changes in disease. In the future, the approaches we develop will lead to software that suggests individualized therapies for patients based on clinical methylation data.",Computational modeling of DNA methylation-mediated gene regulation,10168608,R01LM013096,"['Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'International', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Publishing', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Training', 'Translating', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer type', 'clinical sequencing', 'cofactor', 'demethylation', 'embryonic stem cell', 'epigenetic therapy', 'epigenome', 'epigenome editing', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide methylation', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'in silico', 'individualized medicine', 'long short term memory network', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'mutant', 'nanopore', 'network architecture', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,366581
"Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT SUMMARY Genes are regulated through transcription factor (TF) binding to specific DNA target sites in the genome. These target sites are recognized through several layers of specificity determinants. The most extensively studied layer of binding specificity are hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts between protein amino acids and functional groups of the base pairs mainly in the major groove. Base readout recognizes nucleotide sequence within a short core-binding site of only a few base pairs. However, these distinct sequence combinations in a TF binding motif occur many times in the genome and only a very small fraction of putative binding sites are functional. It is still unknown how a TF locates and identifies its in vivo binding sites in the plethora of possible genomic target sites. Recognition of three-dimensional DNA structure is an additional layer that refines base readout. While the latter is restricted to direct contacts with the core motif, shape readout is a mechanism through which flanking regions of the core motif or spacer regions between half-sites of dimeric TFs contribute to binding specificity. Other layers of in vivo TF binding determinants are chromatin structure, DNA accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation, cofactors and cooperative binding, and cell type. Given this multi-layer nature of TF recognition, we will develop quantitative models to predict TF binding with high accuracy. More important, however, is that our models will reveal recognition mechanisms in the absence of experiment-based structural information. We will build models where each distinct layer of TF binding specificity determinants is added to a base-line model combining DNA sequence and shape. Since it is expected that the importance of each of these TF binding specificity determinants will vary dramatically across protein families, we will use feature selection to identify relative contributions of each feature group as a function of TF or TF family. We will also develop a deep learning framework where individual feature modules can be added or removed from the input layer of convolutional neural networks. This approach will leverage the advantages of deep learning while circumventing the “black box” nature of standard deep learning methods. We will also generate experimental data for specific TFs using the SELEX-seq technology. This approach is currently able to probe the effect of cofactors, cooperative binding, and protein mutations on the binding specificity of a TF. We will add nucleosomes to the SELEX-seq binding assay and, thereby, probe chromatin effects on TF binding using an in vitro experiment in the absence of other cellular contributions. This project will result in a better mechanistic understanding of TF-DNA binding and reveal the impact of various specificity determinants across multiple scales. The new insights will describe different combinations of readout mechanisms on a protein-family specific basis. Our new methods will yield progress in biomedical innovation that is based on transcription and gene regulation. The generated knowledge will better integrate genomics and biophysics, and the project will contribute to the training and mentoring of a new generation of scientists. Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT NARRATIVE Gene regulatory mechanisms require the binding of transcription factors to highly selective target sites in the genome. By itself, the DNA sequence of the core motif is often insufficient to explain transcription factor binding to a very small fraction of the many more available putative sites. The development of new computational methods in combination with generation of experimental binding data will reveal the protein- family specific use of readout modes at atomic, molecular, and cellular scales.",Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding,10189652,R35GM130376,"['3-Dimensional', 'Amino Acids', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Epitopes', 'Family', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Hydrophobicity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Major Groove', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleosomes', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'base', 'cell type', 'cofactor', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'dimer', 'experimental study', 'feature selection', 'functional group', 'histone modification', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R35,2021,523665
"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell epigenetic associations in and biomarkers for knee osteoarthritis development and progression Project Summary / Abstract The objective of the proposed research is to better understand how peripheral blood epigenetic patterns are associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA). A great deal of work has already been demonstrated widespread epigenetic changes within articular tissues in both knee and hip OA. Others have described serum and urine protein biomarkers as predictors of future knee OA progression. Our first Aim is to evaluate peripheral blood cell DNA epigenetic patterns in baseline blood samples from patients who will go on to have rapid radiographc and/or pain progression in the subsequent 24 months. We will then use these data to develop develop and evaluate the performance of epigenetic algorithmic models to discriminate these groups. Patient samples will parallel the National Institutes of Health OA Biomarkers Consortium (OABC-FNIH) study. DNA methylation will be evaluated using a next-generation bisulfite sequencing approach (methylSeq), and algorithms developed using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. We will then translate our findings into a more high- throughput, inexpensive, and clinically relevant form by developing and validating a targeted capture sequencing system to interrogate these specific epigenetic locations. Our second Aim is to evaluate the peripheral blood DNA methylation patterns that precede the development of OA, using samples from 48-, 24-, 12-, and 0-months before incident OA. We will again develop algorithms to predict future OA development using similar techniques as Aim 1 and translate this to a targeted capture sequencing system. This unique longitudinal approach which will allow us not only to determine whether and when epigenetic patterns develop preceding OA development, but also track longitudinal epigenetic changes as OA develops. The proposed work is important, as there are no FDA approved biomarkers for OA diagnosis or prognosis. Our work is quite innovative both in its combination of ""big data"" epigenetic analysis and cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to a specific clinical problem, as well as in its examination of PBMC epigenetics in OA, which has not yet been described. Moreover, we tackle the problem of translation of big-data research by aiming specifically to develop high-throughput methods to translate our findings into a clinically-relevant and accessible form. Success in our proposal will produce both algorithmic models with direct clinical impact to predict future OA development and progression, as well as broaden our understanding of epigenetic changes in peripheral blood cells from OA patients. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because a better understanding of blood epigenetic patterns in osteoarthritis (OA) is likely not only to give insights into the causes of OA, but also to give rise to new biomarkers to assist physicians and researchers diagnose OA patients and predict how rapidly they will worsen over time.
