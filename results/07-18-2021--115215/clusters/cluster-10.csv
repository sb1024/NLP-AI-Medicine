"Development of New Genome Editing Agents Using RNA Modifying Enzymes Komor – Project Summary/Abstract - “Development of New Genome Editing Agents Using RNA Modifying Enzymes”  While targeted genome editing, the introduction of a specific modification in genomic DNA, has the potential to allow researchers to study and better understand mechanisms of human genetic diseases, traditional genome editing methods (including CRISPR-Cas9) that rely on the initial introduction of double stranded DNA breaks (DSB) suffer from modest genome editing efficiencies as well as unwanted gene alterations (indels), particularly when attempting to correct point mutations. Recently, a class of genome editing agents called single base editors was developed that does not involve DSBs, but rather uses a dCas9-tethered single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) modifying enzyme to directly chemically modify target nucleobases within a ~5 nucleotide window determined by the protospacer. Two classes of editors have been developed that use cytosine and adenine deamination chemistries to catalyze the conversion of C•G base pairs to T•A (CBEs), and A•T base pairs to G•C (ABEs), respectively. Here we propose the development and characterization of new base editors capable of facilitating new point mutations using methylation chemistry. We have use a bioinformatic approach to identify RNA modifying enzymes that have the potential to be repurposed into new base editors, and have rationally designed mutant libraries to use with directed evolution to convert these enzymes into base editors (Aim 1). Concurrently, we are developing a machine learning program that utilizes existing ssDNA modifying enzymes to identify putative mutations that will expand the substrate scope of the identified methyltransferases to ssDNA (Aim 2). Mutations identified from both strategies will then be tested and characterized for base editing in multiple orthogonal systems (Aim 3). The successful completion of the proposed work will represent a significant addition to existing base editing technologies, and will enable researchers to cleanly and efficiently install two additional types of point mutations into the genome of living cells, allowing researchers to quickly and effectively general model systems for the study of human genetic diseases. Komor – Project Narrative - “Development of New Genome Editing Agents Using RNA Modifying Enzymes” Base editing enables high efficiency genomic point mutation introduction in a variety of cell types and has the potential to allow researchers to better study human genetic diseases. We propose transformative improvements to current base editing technologies that will expand the types of point mutations that can be introduced by base editors. The tools developed here will enable researchers to cleanly and efficiently install additional types of point mutations into the genome of living cells for the study and potential treatment of human genetic diseases.",Development of New Genome Editing Agents Using RNA Modifying Enzymes,9876634,R21GM135736,"['Adenine', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Base Pairing', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Case Study', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Communities', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'Deamination', 'Development', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Gene Mutation', 'Generations', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inosine', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Methyltransferase', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathogenicity', 'Point Mutation', 'Program Development', 'Proteins', 'Purines', 'Pyrimidine', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'Single-Stranded DNA', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transfer RNA', 'Uracil', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adenosine deaminase', 'base', 'cell type', 'combat', 'design', 'genome editing', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'molecular dynamics', 'mutant', 'novel', 'nucleobase', 'preference', 'programs', 'tool', 'transition mutation', 'transversion mutation']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2019,205479,0.08895275656646891
"Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations Project Summary Although a quickly expanding catalogue of protein mutations have been discovered, including those that cause human diseases or confer drug resistance, mechanistic understanding and prediction of functional consequences of these mutations remain rather limited. There is a critical need to develop novel, multiscale computational frameworks that are rigorous and generalizable to help close the ever-increasing gap between phenotypic data and mechanistic knowledge about the mutations and to develop effective therapeutic strategies.  My long-term research goals are two folds: (1) to unravel how a change in protein sequence ripples through various aspects of molecular and system-levels to a change in cellular function and cause human diseases or confer drug resistance; and (2) to translate learned mechanistic knowledge to effective drug-design strategies for human diseases and drug resistance. Toward these goals I propose to advance and combine the strengths of computational molecular biology (structural modeling and design for proteins or protein interactions) and computational systems biology (pathway/network-level topology and dynamics) and follow a novel, formal paradigm to develop methods that systematically identify mechanisms underlying various stages of consequence propagation (from conformation, molecular and system-level variables, to cellular functions, where intermediates can be skipped if necessary). In the forward direction of propagating consequences, I will determine, explain and understand mutational consequences at various levels with machine learning, causal analysis, and combinatorial optimization, starting with known or modelled changes at various levels. In the inverse direction of designing consequences, I will follow known or learned mechanistic hypotheses and develop efficient combinatorial optimization methods to design mutagenesis experiments or screen / design ligands for desired perturbations at various levels, which would test and refine corresponding hypotheses directly and translate mechanistic hypotheses to therapeutic strategies. Mechanisms underlying distal (potentially allosteric) mutations, multiple mutations within a protein or across proteins as well as systems pharmacology strategies will also be rigorously determined in the process.  The expected outcomes from the innovative project will include two main components. The first will be both biophysical principles of proteins and integrative understanding of biomedical systems, which will be organized in a database for public access. The second will be translating mechanistic insights into therapeutic intervention strategies to treat diseases. In particular, targeted experiments (mutagenesis or ligand-binding) will be designed following known or discovered mechanistic hypotheses. This project will involve close collaboration with structural biologists and clinician-scientists who are active collaborators of the PI. Project Narrative Genetic mutations, many of which lead to protein mutations, are often associated with human diseases: they often directly cause diseases or contribute to their progressions. Understanding mechanisms by which these mutations lead to significant functional consequences is of extreme importance to developing effective therapeutics to cure diseases and ameliorate drug resistance.",Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations,9774239,R35GM124952,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biophysics', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Distal', 'Drug Design', 'Drug resistance', 'Goals', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacology', 'Process', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structural Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'phenotypic data']",NIGMS,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R35,2019,335245,0.11250081240178653
"The Evolution of Gene Regulation and Human Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Genetic variants that disrupt the functionality of regulatory sequences, and thereby alter gene expression levels, are major contributors to both evolutionary divergence between species and differences in risk for complex disease among humans. However, due to the complexity of the gene regulatory programs encoded in mammalian genomes and their rapid turnover between species, evaluating the function of non-protein-coding mutations is challenging. This is a major roadblock to tracing the evolution of human-specific biology. In addition, since the majority of disease-associated variants are non-coding, it impairs our ability to map the genetics of complex disease.  The long-term mission of my lab is to interpret the complex gene regulatory programs encoded in the human genome and accurately model the effects of genetic mutations to these elements on phenotypes relevant to disease and human evolution. We work toward these goals by integrating cutting-edge machine learning, statistical modeling of evolution, and the analysis of genotypes and phenotypes from large-scale clinical biobanks. In particular, my lab is uniquely well positioned to build on our previous work to address the following fundamental questions:  1. How have evolutionary transitions on the human-lineage modified the genome—in particular gene  regulatory programs—to produce human-specific biology? And how do these modifications relate to  human-specific disease risk?  2. What are the combinatorial rules underlying how TF binding patterns specify precise control of gene  regulation? And how do these gene regulatory “programs” evolve between species?  3. How do genetic and epigenetic mechanisms interact to specify the dynamic gene regulatory programs  that drive cellular development? And how are these programs perturbed in disease?  4. How can we interpret non-protein-coding mutations identified in patient genomes to inform treatment  and preventative care? Our work will produce much-needed methods for understanding the effects of mutations to gene regulatory regions and identify mutations responsible for differences in disease risk between human populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The genetic mutations that distinguish humans from other great apes and that influence risk for complex disease are mostly found outside of genes. Many of these mutations influence when and where genes are expressed. However, we do not know how to interpret the effects of most such mutations on gene regulation, disease risk, or human evolution, we will develop computational models that leverage machine learning, evolutionary patterns, and large-scale clinical biobanks to identify mutations that disrupt proper control of genes and lead to disease.",The Evolution of Gene Regulation and Human Disease,9673749,R35GM127087,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Impairment', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pongidae', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive care', 'Regulator Genes', 'Risk', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Models', 'To specify', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biobank', 'cellular development', 'combinatorial', 'disorder risk', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'mammalian genome', 'programs', 'species difference']",NIGMS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R35,2019,392270,0.08132676794896912
"The adaptive potential of translational regulation Project Summary/Abstract  Our current understanding of the adaptive effects of mutation is largely limited to alterations in protein coding sequence and disruption of transcriptional cis-regulatory promoters. Very little is known about how mutations alter translation, or the role these mutations play in adaptation and evolution. This project seeks to address this gap by identifying the functional effect of mutations on translation. To accomplish this I will first identify mutations that arise from adaptation to various nutrient limited environments. I will then use expression profiling (e.g. RNA-seq, ribosome profiling, and RATE-seq) to identify the effect these mutations have on translation, as well as other levels of gene expression. This will provide insight into the magnitude of effect mutations have on translation and their relative rate. Furthermore, to fully characterize the role synonymous mutations have on fitness I will be using a deep scanning synonymous mutation library. To understand the role tRNA abundance plays in the fitness effect of a given synonymous mutations, I will also be evaluating fitness within tRNA under- and over-expression backgrounds. Because of the closely coupled nature of translation rates and mRNA decay, I will also characterize the effect synonymous mutations have on mRNA decay using RATE-seq. My analysis of the functional effects of these mutations on gene expression, particularly within the genetic background and environment in which they arose, will allow for the development of a machine learning algorithm that can use sequence and annotation features to predict the effect of a mutation on gene expression. This tool will aid future research into the effect mutations have of gene expression by allowing the identification of high-confidence candidates for further evaluation.  This project will be conducted at New York University’s Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, whose mission is to answer otherwise intractable biological questions using applied experimental and computational approaches. The Center houses numerous facilities and cores that will be instrumental in the performance of this work. The collaborative atmosphere and multi-disciplinary nature of NYU’s research communities that will enable me to stay abreast of developments in related fields and to rapidly communicate my research to interested parties. I will be trained under the guidance of Dr. David Gresham, an excellent researcher working on complementing long-term evolution experiments with gene expression studies to characterize the adaptive potential of the regulation of gene expression. Project Narrative The translation of mRNA into protein is a critical step in gene expression that is tightly regulated with mis-regulation of translation being a hallmark of many human pathologies. Understanding how mutations can alter the regulation of translation is an understudied but important aspect of adaptation and evolution. Ultimately, without an understanding of the adaptive potential of translation we have an incomplete, and imperfect, picture of the underlying genetic causes of numerous forms of cancer and genetic diseases.",The adaptive potential of translational regulation,9683394,F32GM131573,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Expression Profiling', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human Pathology', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'New York', 'Nutrient', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Pathology', 'Performance at work', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transfer RNA', 'Translation Initiation', 'Translational Regulation', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'actionable mutation', 'analytical tool', 'cancer genetics', 'collaborative environment', 'environmental change', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genome sequencing', 'insight', 'interest', 'mRNA Decay', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'mutation screening', 'novel', 'preservation', 'promoter', 'response', 'ribosome profiling', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,61226,0.11588785697412439
"Physics-based precision medicine: computationally phenotyping myosin isoforms and cardiomyopathy mutations PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Myosins are a diverse and ubiquitous class of molecular motors that are responsible for generating much of the macroscopic force in the human body. The human genome encodes 38 different isoforms of myosin, and members of this group act as force sensors or generators for a diverse set of processes throughout the body. To serve this wide array of functions, each myosin isoform has been biophysically tuned for its physiological role. In fact, the tuning is so precise that missense variants in one myosin isoform, !-cardiac myosin, can cause a congenital cardiomyopathy that is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in people under 30. And yet, it is unknown how particular variants cause disease, or how to infer the pathogenic potential for novel mutations.  Large differences in functional properties between myosin isoforms are not the result of large differences in coding sequence or overall topology. Neither foreknowledge of phylogeny nor crystal structure is sufﬁcient to predict an isoform's biophysical properties. Furthermore, mutations causing disease frequently occur in regions of the protein far from the site of their deleterious effects. Poor understanding of the biophysical regulation of motor function has hampered the development of pharmaceuticals and the interpretation of human genomic data.  My goal is to establish a mechanistic understanding of myosin motors that is capable of predicting if and how sequence variation changes biophysical properties and can cause cardiac disease. Since myosin kinetics are not apparent from sequence or overall structure, they must be determined by other factors. I hypothesize that kinetic differences result from differences in the allosteric networks in these proteins. Allosteric network in this context refers to the coordinated conformational ﬂuctuations that give protein regulation the appearance of action at a distance. To test this hypothesis, we will use our unique combination of enormous computational power for molecular simulation and cutting-edge machine learning tools for analyzing protein allostery.  Aim 1 is to identify the biophysical determinants of myosin isoforms' differing speeds. To test our hypothesis that allosteric networks are responsible for modulating dynamics, I will use molecular simulations of different myosin isoforms and compare their allosteric networks with biochemical data about their properties. Aim 1 directly addresses outstanding questions about normal molecular-biological function of the heart, putting it in line with NHLBI overarching objective #1.  Aim 2 is to determine the difference, at atomic resolution, between healthy and diseased !-cardiac myosin. I hypothesize that the pathogenicity of variants with an unknown molecular etiology is a consequence of allosteric disruption, and will use our computational tools to test this hypothesis by simulating a set of known-pathogenic variants. This aim uses techniques from data science to understand the genetic determinants of health, and will apply equally well to rare alleles in under-represented groups as to majority groups. It is directly addresses NHLBI overarching objectives #3, #4, and #7. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Myosins are a closely-related group of molecules that are responsible for generating much of the force in the human body, including the heartbeat, the movement of limbs, and driving food through the stomach and intestines. Small changes to the myosin genes can have large effects: in healthy people, these give rise to different myosins that perform different functions, and mutations in some myosin genes can give rise to diseases that cause of sudden cardiac death. This proposal aims to learn, at the level of atoms and interatomic bonds, why and how these subtle changes to the myosin gene can create such large effects in the protein's function.",Physics-based precision medicine: computationally phenotyping myosin isoforms and cardiomyopathy mutations,9678589,F30HL146052,"['Actins', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Appearance', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Process', 'Biophysics', 'Cardiac Myosins', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Catalysis', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Congenital cardiomyopathy', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Binding Site', 'Etiology', 'Food', 'Genes', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Human body', 'Intestines', 'Kinetics', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Motors', 'Motor', 'Mutation', 'Myosin ATPase', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient risk', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Region', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Relaxation', 'Resolution', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solvents', 'Speed', 'Stomach', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Variant', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'computerized tools', 'disease-causing mutation', 'genomic data', 'heart function', 'improved', 'insight', 'limb movement', 'member', 'millisecond', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'protein function', 'prototype', 'rare variant', 'rat Ran 2 protein', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F30,2019,30442,0.06855476954782885
"Computational evaluation of the causal role of somatic mutations in human aging Project Abstract Although genome instability has long been considered as one of the major causal factors of aging, little is known about the actual number of genome alterations per cell and their effects on aging organisms, most notably humans. In the research proposed here I will take a single cell approach to identify the most common types of somatic mutations, i.e., base substitutions, small INDELS, copy number variation, genome structural variation and retrotranspositions, in human B lymphocytes as a function of age. The overarching goal is then to estimate functional effects of these DNA mutations accumulated during human aging in this particular cell type, which will also serve as a model for studying somatic mutations and their consequences in other cell types. This could never be tested before, because it was never possible to analyze random somatic mutations in a tissue by sequencing bulk DNA from that tissue (mutations are low- abundant), I will achieve this goal by utilizing a new, single-cell, whole genome sequencing (SCWGS) protocol that we developed. In this project I will focus on human B lymphocytes from individuals varying in age from about 30 to over 100 years and determine the genome-wide frequency and location of the different types of mutations in multiple cells from each individual (Aim 1). Preliminary results already show a significant increase of both base substitution mutations and CNVs with age, with a substantial number of these mutations in B cell genomic regions that are potentially functional. Hence, in Aim 2 I will predict the actual functional effects of these potentially functional, age-related mutations using machine learning approaches and integrative network analysis. Finally, in Aim 3 I will empirically test these predictions as to whether the mutation loads observed affect B cell's ability of response to stimulus. Hence, to test the long-standing hypothesis of genome instability as a causal factor in aging ,I will determine age-related mutations in single cells at four levels: (1) number of mutations, mutation spectra and genome distribution in individual cells; (2) potential functional effects of individual mutations, i.e., non-synonymous mutations in exons and mutations in gene regulatory regions; (3) mutations collectively affecting the gene regulatory network; and (4) relationship between mutation load and B cell activation status. In summary, the results of the proposed project will, for the first time uncover possible direct functional effects of somatic mutations on cellular function. Project Narrative Genome instability is considered as one of the major factors of aging and age-related diseases. This research aims to study somatic DNA mutations in normal blood cells (B lymphocytes) of humans of different ages and evaluate the functional effect of these mutations. It will dramatically improve the knowledge of DNA mutations in aging and deepen the understanding of genome instability as a basic aging mechanism in human.",Computational evaluation of the causal role of somatic mutations in human aging,9785353,K99AG056656,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', '5&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'B-Cell Activation', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding Sites', 'Blood Cells', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Centenarian', 'Code', 'Collecting Cell', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Replication Damage', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'DNA amplification', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enhancers', 'Evaluation', 'Exons', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomic Segment', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunization', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Locus Control Region', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Mutation Spectra', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA amplification', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Retrotransposition', 'Role', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Somatic Cell', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'age related', 'base', 'cell type', 'crosslink', 'dietary restriction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'nonsynonymous mutation', 'promoter', 'repair enzyme', 'repaired', 'response', 'single cell sequencing', 'single cell technology', 'theories', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NIA,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K99,2019,135945,0.1805365329197589
"Predicting Transcriptional and Epigenetic Networks in Cancer from Sequencing Data Limitless replicative potential is a key hallmark of cancer and critically depends on telomere maintenance. Many cancers thus aberrantly reactivate the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), a catalytic subunit of the telomerase complex that elongates telomere. It has been recently discovered that this common path to immortality in multiple cancers is through two activating point mutations in the TERT promoter (TERTp), found in more than 50 different cancer types, often at strikingly high frequencies, e.g. roughly 83% in glioblastomas (GBM) and 71% in melanomas. In the previous funding period, the PI has identified the molecular function of these highly recurrent mutations, demonstrating that the transcription factor (TF) GABP binds the mutant TERTp with exquisite specificity, but not the wild-type TERTp. The high prevalence of TERTp mutations across multiple cancer types and the selectivity of GABP recruitment to mutant TERTp thus provide an unprecedented opportunity for treating a large number of cancer patients with minimal toxicity to healthy cells. Despite the clear significance of this opportunity, however, several important questions surrounding the molecular functions and modulators of TERTp mutations remain poorly understood, hindering the development of effective and safe therapeutic strategies.  Our long-term goal is to establish a rigorous computational framework for understanding the aberrant transcriptional and epigenetic networks in cancers and to apply the resulting knowledge to devise novel therapeutic strategies that account for the genetic background of individual patients and that can a priori predict and avoid potential resistance mechanisms. The objective of our current renewal proposal is to develop powerful computational methods for transforming our knowledge about the non-coding TERTp mutations into an effective and safe molecular target. At the same time, the resulting methods will help resolve several outstanding challenges in the field of transcriptional gene regulation and have broad applications in cancer genomics. We will accomplish our objective my pursuing the following Aims: (1) Develop and test a computational framework for inferring sequence features that determine the distinct and shared binding patterns of paralogous TFs; (2) Develop and validate integrative tools for discovering the molecular basis of genetic interactions between germline variations and oncogenic mutations; (3) Develop and apply computational methods for studying the role of DNA helical phase between adjacent binding motifs in recruiting ETS factors to chromatin; (4) Perform a systematic genomic characterization of the effects of knocking out GABPB1L in TERTp-mutant cancer cells and healthy cells. The results of this proposal will have a broad impact on cancer research by providing powerful tools for studying paralogous oncogenic TFs and revealing novel insights into a highly promising therapeutic strategy. The proposed research will provide computational and bioinformatic resources for studying the binding pattern of paralogous oncogenic transcription factors. It will provide a computational framework for inferring the function of non-coding regulatory mutations and studying their interaction with common genetic variants. As an important application, we will systematically analyze a novel therapeutic strategy that has the potential to treat effectively a large number of patients across multiple cancer types harboring the recently discovered TERT promoter mutations.",Predicting Transcriptional and Epigenetic Networks in Cancer from Sequencing Data,9609431,R01CA163336,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug resistance', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specificity', 'TERT gene', 'Techniques', 'Telomerase', 'Telomere Maintenance', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bioinformatics resource', 'c-myc Genes', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer type', 'computer framework', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'dimer', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'knowledge of results', 'melanoma', 'member', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'resistance mechanism', 'telomere', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'treatment response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2019,317385,0.11864351204174775
"ADPKD: Disease Spectrum & Genotype-Phenotype Correlations Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common monoallelic disorder associated with progressive cyst development and resulting in end stage renal failure (ESRD) in 50% of patients by 60y. However, there is considerable phenotypic variability, extending from in utero onset to patients with adequate renal function into old age. Autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD), as traditionally defined, results in PLD with minimal renal cysts. Classically there have been considered two ADPKD genes, PKD1 and PKD2, encoding PC1 and PC2, and two ADPLD genes, PRKCSH and SEC63, but in the past few years greater genetic heterogeneity has been described, with nine genes now implicated overall. Recent data also indicates an overlap in etiology and pathogenesis associated with ADPKD and ADPLD, with the efficient biogenesis and localization of the PC-complex central to both disorders. During the last funding period we identified a novel gene, GANAB, which is associated with both disorders, where the encoded protein, GII is involved in the maturation and trafficking of PC1.  In this proposal we will take advantage of advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) methodologies, and large populations of ADPKD and ADPLD patients that have been assembled and screened for the classic genes, to hunt for novel genes for these disorders (Aim 1). The phenotype associated with these genes will be characterized (Aim 3) along with their mechanism of action (Aim 2). NGS methods will be perfected to screen the segmentally duplicated locus, PKD1, and to identify missed mutations at the known loci, including those present in just some cells due to mosaicism (Aim 1). The significance of many PKD1 nontruncating variants has been difficult to evaluate (classed as variants of unknown significance; VUS), but recently evidence that some are incompletely penetrant alleles partially explains phenotypic variability in PKD1 populations. In Aim 2 improved in silico predictions, in combination with machine learning, will improve the understanding of the pathogenicity and penetrance of VUS. A cellular assay of the biogenesis and trafficking of this PC-complex will also be employed to quantify the penetrance of VUS. The mechanism of pathogenesis will be explored in animal models with ultralow penetrant (ULP) Pkd1 or Pkd2 alleles. Employing the large clinically, imaging, and genetically well-defined populations phenotypic groupings of patients will be defined that will then be compared to the genic and PKD1 allelic groups (Aim 3). This iterative process will allow the Variant Score (VS) associated with each PKD1 VUS to be refined. In a separate population the revised VS, alone and in combination with clinical, functional, and imaging data, will be employed to generate a comprehensive, predictive algorithm for ADPKD (Aim 3). Disease modifiers to severe disease, via biallelic ADPKD, and due to alleles at other loci will also be identified and characterized in the cellular assay and in vivo in combination with the Pkd1 hypomorphic, RC model. The final aim will exploit the newly identified information that some PKD1 and PKD2 VUS are rescuable, folding mutations that in a maturation-fostering environment can traffic and function appropriately. A screening scheme based on the level of cell surface PC1 will be improved and new chaperone drugs specific for the PC complex will be sought in collaboration with Sanford Burnham Prebys. A second mutation group that will be explored therapeutically are nonsense mutations. A cellular assay for readthrough efficiency is being developed and will be used for screening. Identified chaperone or readthrough drugs will be tested in available mouse models. Overall this proposal will better explain the etiology and the genetic causes of phenotypic variability in ADPKD/ADPLD, develop better prognostic tools for individual selection of patients for treatment that are now becoming available, and explore allele based treatments for ADPKD.

"Deep learning-based approach to identify non-coding cancer drivers that alter chromatin conformation Summary Most variants obtained from tumor whole-genome sequences (WGS) occur in non- coding regions of the genome. Although variants in protein-coding regions have received the majority of attention, numerous studies have now noted the importance of non- coding variants in cancer. Identification of functional non-coding variants that drive tumor growth remains a challenge and a bottleneck for the use of whole-genome sequencing in the clinic. Cancer drivers are generally identified by the high frequency at which their mutations occur across patients. However, mutation rate is highly heterogeneous in non- coding regions and many non-driver elements show higher mutation frequency than others, such as regions bound by transcription factors in melanoma or regions replicating late during cell division in colon cancer. In this proposal, we will use high- throughput pooled CRISPR screen and novel computational methods to predict non- coding cancer drivers. We will quantitatively measure the impact of thousands of non- coding mutations using our innovative high-throughput CRISPR screen that directly ties modifications in the native context of the non-coding genome (i.e. not a reporter assay) to a cancer relevant phenotype (cell growth). The results of the screen will be used as training data for the development of NC_Driver, a computational cancer driver prediction tool. NC_Driver will integrate the signals of high functional impact with the recurrence of variants across multiple tumor samples to identify the non-coding mutations under positive selection in cancer. We will identify drivers in promoters, enhancers and CTCF insulators. CTCF insulators are the most mutated yet least studied regulatory elements in the cancer genome. Using this integrative experimental and computational approach, we will identify high-confidence candidate drivers. Finally, we will perform functional evaluation of prioritized non-coding drivers in colorectal and prostate cancers. We will use CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in patient-derived cell cultures to test 20 high-ranking candidate driver promoter/enhancer/insulator mutations. Overall, this proposal addresses the critical need to identify drivers in the non-coding genome and over long- term enable the maximal benefit of genome sequencing for each patient. Project Narrative Cancer genomes contain thousands of mutations but only a few of them play an important role in cancer proliferation and are called drivers. Most of the mutations occur in regions of the genome that do not make proteins, yet the majority of previous studies have focused on protein-coding regions. In this proposal, we will use integrative computational and experimental approaches to identify drivers in the non-protein-coding regions of the genome.",Deep learning-based approach to identify non-coding cancer drivers that alter chromatin conformation,9831005,R01CA218668,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Attention', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell division', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinic', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Colon', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Heterogeneity', 'Institutes', 'Knock-in', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prostate', 'Proteins', 'Recurrence', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Screening Result', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Structure', 'Targeted Resequencing', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Xenograft procedure', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer genome', 'cancer type', 'cell growth', 'cohort', 'colon cancer cell line', 'deep learning', 'genome editing', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'melanoma', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'promoter', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumorigenesis', 'tumorigenic', 'whole genome']",NCI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2019,113967,0.05107244002514989
"Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes Project Summary Over the last two decades, significant experimental efforts have determined large sets of “reference” interactions for humans and other model organisms, along with substantial knowledge about the binding specificities of proteins, including for a large fraction of human transcription factors (TFs). The resulting data have proven to be an incredibly useful resource for understanding how cells function; nevertheless, they do not capture how molecular interactions and networks are different from the reference across individuals. Indeed, while human genomes in both healthy and disease populations are rapidly being sequenced, the corresponding individual-specific interaction networks remain largely unexamined; this represents a major gap in our knowledge, as mutations that alter molecular interactions underlie a wide range of human diseases. Further, the substantial amount of genetic variation across populations makes it infeasible in the near term to experimentally determine per-individual interaction networks. Thus our long-term goal is to develop computational methods to uncover whether and how mutations within coding and non-coding portions of the genome perturb cellular interactions and networks. Our specific aims are: (1) We will develop computational structure-based approaches to identify and catalog, at proteome-scale, variations within proteins that are likely to impact their ability to bind with DNA, RNA, small molecules, peptides or ions, thereby providing a comprehensive resource for analyzing protein interaction variation. (2) We will develop novel structure-based and probabilistic methods to predict how DNA-binding specificities are altered when a TF is mutated; since mutated TFs have been linked to numerous diseases, this will be a great aid in understanding disease networks and pathology. (3) We will develop new methods to uncover non-coding somatic mutations that alter human regulatory networks in cancer; this is a critical step towards ultimately uncovering patient-specific cancer networks. Overall by pursuing these aims—which integrate mutational information with existing knowledge about reference interactions, interfaces and specificities—we will develop novel computational methods that will significantly advance our understanding of molecular interactions perturbed in disease and healthy contexts. Narrative The proposed research will yield new software tools that predict whether specific genetic mutations alter molecular interactions and networks. Since many human diseases are caused by mutations that affect molecular interactions, this research will expand our understanding of the underlying basis of disease and will provide new avenues for diagnosis and treatment.",Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes,9740714,R01GM076275,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Organism', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'preference', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,312660,0.10308923770568891
"Functional Annotation of Natural and Disease Variants in Tryosine Kinases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein tyrosine kinases are dynamic molecular switches that toggle between a catalytically ""on"" and ""off"" state to turn on and off signals responsible for cell growth and survival. While the tyrosine kinase switch is tightly regulated by  diverse array of structural mechanisms in normal states, in many disease states, the switch is permanently turned on or off due, in part, to mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain. Although genome sequencing studies have revealed the mutational patterns of tyrosine kinases from many different disease types, understanding the structural and functional impact of these mutations is a challenge because many recurrent mutations occur far from the active site (distal mutations) and the residue networks that contribute to the complex modes of tyrosine kinase allosteric regulation are not fully understood. Our long term goal is to understand the relationships connecting sequence, structure, function, regulation and disease in protein kinases using a combination of computational and experimental approaches. Our objective in this proposal, which is the next logical step toward attainment of our long-term goal, is to delineate the residue interaction networks that contribute to the unique modes of allosteric regulation in tyrosine kinases, and to develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact using the evolutionary and allosteric properties encoded in three dimensional structures. The central hypothesis is that distal mutations alter evolutionarily conserved allosteric networks in tyrosine kinases, and delineating the allosteric networks unique to tyrosine kinases will provide context for predicting and testing disease mutation impact. The specific aims are: * To identify and characterize natural sequence and structural variants associated with tight  allosteric control of tyrosine kinase activity * To develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact on kinase activation and to  experimentally validate computational predictions using selected receptor tyrosine kinases as  model systems Successful completion of these aims is expected to reveal novel activating mutations in putative allosteric sites in the tyrosine kinase domain, and pinpoint key residues and interactions for functional studies. These outcomes, in turn, are expected to have major biomedical impact by accelerating the functional characterization of the mutated tyrosine kinome, which is emerging as a major target for personalized medicine. Finally, by providing detailed mechanistic annotation of mutations identified in genome sequencing studies, this proposal will address a fundamental NIH roadmap problem in translational medicine of converting genomic discoveries into therapeutic strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein tyrosine kinases are a biomedically important class of proteins that are abnormally regulated in many human diseases including cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory disorders, to name but a few. They have been the focus of many drug discovery efforts and genome sequencing studies because of the therapeutic potential of targeting mutated tyrosine kinases for personalized therapy. By providing functional annotation of natural and disease mutations in tyrosine kinases, the proposed studies will accelerate the targeting of mutated tyrosine kinases for drug discovery and personalized therapy.",Functional Annotation of Natural and Disease Variants in Tryosine Kinases,9731524,R01GM114409,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Allosteric Regulation', 'Allosteric Site', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cell Survival', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Binding Site', 'Drug resistance', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammatory', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Property', 'Protein Kinase', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tyrosine', 'Tyrosine Kinase Domain', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell growth', 'computer framework', 'drug discovery', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'molecular dynamics', 'mutant', 'nonsynonymous mutation', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive test', 'public health relevance', 'three dimensional structure', 'translational medicine']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2019,300000,0.1788186616005493
"A statistical framework to systematically characterize cancer driver mutations in noncoding genomic regions PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer genomes typically harbor a substantial number of somatic mutations. Relatively few driver mutations actually alter the function of proteins in tumor cells, whereas most mutations are considered to be functionally neutral passenger mutations. Over the past decade, the search for cancer driver mutations has focused on coding regions and several mutational significance algorithms have been developed for coding mutations. The contribution of mutations in noncoding regulatory regions to tumor formation largely remains unknown and current mutational significance algorithms are not designed to detect driver mutations in noncoding regions, due to biological differences between coding and noncoding mutations. The emerging availability of large whole- genome sequencing datasets (e.g. PCAWG and HMF datasets) creates an ample opportunity to develop new mutational significance algorithms that are particularly designed for the interpretation of noncoding regions. Recently, we have developed a new statistical approach that identifies driver mutations in coding regions based on the nucleotide context. Critically, consideration of the nucleotide context around mutations does not require prior knowledge for functional consequences associated with these mutations. Hence, we hypothesize that generalizing our nucleotide context model to noncoding regions will uncover novel noncoding driver mutations that cannot be detected using the mutational significance approaches currently available. For this purpose, we will develop a statistical framework that incorporates the biological differences between coding and noncoding mutations and that is specifically designed to detect driver mutations in noncoding regions. Specifically, we will consider the context-dependent distribution of passenger mutations, modeling of the background mutation rate, accurately partition the background mutation rate, model the sequence composition of the reference genome, and account for coverage fluctuation. We will then combine these statistical components by computing an independent product of their underlying probabilities. We will derive a significance p-value using a Monte-Carlo simulation approach, and use FDR for multiple hypothesis test correction. This strategy will allow us to accurately estimate the significance of somatic mutations in noncoding genomic regions. We will next apply this statistical framework to whole-genome sequencing data of 5,523 tumor patients, thereby deriving a comprehensive list of candidate driver mutations in noncoding regions. Finally, we will investigate whether noncoding mutations are overrepresented in transcription factor binding sites, regulate gene expression levels, induce alternative splicing, or affect epigenomic states. Upon the completion of this project, we will have developed and applied a statistical framework for discovery of significant somatic mutations in noncoding regions, and defined the mutational landscape of the non-coding cancer genome. All aspects of the methods developed and applied in this project will be made open source and developed in an online platform. PROJECT NARRATIVE While coding cancer driver mutations have been characterized in detail over the past decade, the contribution of noncoding mutations to tumor formation remains - apart from few examples (e.g. mutations in TERT promoters) - largely unknown. Recently, large-scale whole-genome sequencing datasets have been made available, but a major bottleneck for the biological and clinical interpretation of these cancer whole-genome cohorts is the lack of statistical models that identify driver mutations in noncoding regions. We developed a new statistical approach that characterizes driver mutations based on their surrounding nucleotide context in coding regions, and herein we propose a concrete plan to generalize our computational model to noncoding regions, apply our model to aggregated whole-genome sequencing data of 5,523 tumor patients (PCAWG, HMF datasets), and define the noncoding driver and passenger mutational landscape for biological discovery and focused clinical application.",A statistical framework to systematically characterize cancer driver mutations in noncoding genomic regions,9825986,R21CA242861,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Attention', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genomic Segment', 'Immunotherapy', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Untranslated RNA', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'checkpoint therapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical effect', 'cohort', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'exome sequencing', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immunogenicity', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'open source', 'predicting response', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'reference genome', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'whole genome']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R21,2019,232291,0.21332848128658147
"A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions Project summary There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how mutations are preferentially targeted to the variable (V) regions of the Immunoglobulin (Ig) loci during somatic hypermutation (SHM). The persistence of this gap has limited our understanding of the mutagenic mechanisms involving activation-induced deaminase (AID) in the immune response and in the role of AID in mis-targeting mutations leading to B-cell lymphomas and other cancers. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand the global targeting of mutations in immunity that are required to protect us from infections. As high-throughput data from human antibody immune responses became available, it provided us with new opportunities to generate hypotheses to explain the underlying mechanisms of SHM. We now propose to generate further hypotheses using computational models applied to additional databases and to validate these hypotheses using cellular and animal experiments. Our objective is to understand what directs SHM across the many human Ig heavy chain V-regions. Our central hypothesis is that the V-region SHM process is highly dependent on a DNA sequence signature(s) that drives mutations in a largely deterministic fashion. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary results using human in vivo data from a few human V region genes and has begun to be validated using independent databases and experiments in human B cell lines. The rationale is that evaluations of computational data based upon biological mechanisms, together with appropriate biological experiments, will reveal the key differences between IGHV regions (IGHV 3-23, 4-34, 1-18, 1-02, etc.) that lead to the dominance of each of those V regions in the responses to medically important antigens. Our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) identify the extent to which a DNA signature determines the mutation process in four individual human IGHV genes that are important in disease responses; 2) examine the relationship between AID hotspots and Polη hotspots across all the other human V region genes, thus rigorously defining a mutation targeting signature. Both aims will also entail studying human V region genes and modifications of them in human cell lines and in mice expressing a human V region to further confirm the signature and identify molecular mechanisms in vivo. Our approach is innovative because the computational models we are proposing will be mechanistically motivated focusing on the interaction between AID and Polη hotspots, thus testing molecular mechanisms as opposed to classic statistical models using whole V region sequences that ignore the underlying biology. In addition, to focus on mechanisms we will leverage new high-throughput data from human V regions that have not undergone antigen selection. Our results will be highly relevant to human IgV repertoire analyses from immune responses that are currently hard to interpret and will help future vaccine and therapeutic antibody development, as well as help to understand mutations in human malignancies where AID plays a key role. Project narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the targeting of AID-mediated mutations across many human heavy chain V-regions will make it possible to develop vaccines that will lead more rapidly to better and more broadly protective antibodies to infectious agents and reveal the risk factors in the development of B-cell malignancies and gastric and other solid tumors where AID is implicated.",A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions,9653955,R01AI132507,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Experiments', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmunity', 'B lymphoid malignancy', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Gene-Modified', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Heavy-Chain Immunoglobulins', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Knock-in', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stomach', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'activation-induced cytidine deaminase', 'base', 'chromatin modification', 'density', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'human data', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'innovation', 'neutralizing antibody', 'recruit', 'repair enzyme', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'vaccine response']",NIAID,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,587448,0.12175547856311676
"Massively parallel functional analyses of human PTEN variants Project Summary  We are now able to routinely sequence human genomes at single-base resolution. However, our ability to interpret the functional consequences of detected mutations has lagged behind. Computational approaches scale well but have poor accuracy, whereas retrospective analysis of detected variants has high accuracy but does not scale well. In order to solve this problem, a new experimental paradigm has emerged to empirically characterize the effects of mutations with high accuracy at scale. This approach takes advantage of recent and ongoing improvements in DNA synthesis and sequencing, and has the potential to offer unprecedented insight into protein biochemistry and human disease. We believe these insights will prove to be critical for unlocking the potential of genomic medicine.  In this project we seek to comprehensively assess multiple molecular effects of PTEN mutations on protein function, and assess the utility of this data as a predictor for human clinical phenotype. The PTEN protein is a tumor suppressor that is frequently mutated in diverse human cancers and in the germline of some individuals with overgrowth disorders, cancer predisposition syndromes, or autism. Currently, it is impossible to predict the effects of the vast majority of PTEN germline mutations. Since the phenotypic spectrum of PTEN mutation carriers is broad, it would be highly valuable to understand the ways in which phenotypic outcomes arise from PTEN mutation genotypes.  In Aim 1, we will first employ a yeast-based screen to assess the effects all PTEN single amino acid mutations on lipid phosphatase activity, the primary biochemical function of PTEN protein. It is known that several pathogenic variants are destabilized. Therefore, in Aim 2, we will perform a second, independent screen to assess the steady state protein stability of all PTEN single amino acid mutations. In Aim 3, we will use the data derived from this study as well as publically available biochemical information to train a classifier model to predict the relationship between the mutation genotypes and clinical phenotypes observed in humans. These data will increase our fundamental understanding of PTEN function and the role of mutations in diverse disorders, and could provide a valuable clinical tool that would increase the quality of life for PTEN mutation carriers. Project Narrative  Mutations in the gene PTEN are causal for a diverse set of clinical disorders ranging from cancer to autism spectrum disorder. Here, we seek to gain new fundamental insights into the functional relationships between PTEN mutations and clinical presentations by prospectively characterizing the effects of all single amino acid PTEN mutations in parallel. These data will allow the creation of new models that can predict risk of specific PTEN mutations for different clinical outcomes and potentially lead to personalized therapies, early interventions, and optimal outcomes for PTEN mutation carriers.",Massively parallel functional analyses of human PTEN variants,9794010,F31HD095571,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'PTEN gene', 'PTEN protein', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphatidylinositols', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Protein Biochemistry', 'Proteins', 'Pythons', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitination', 'Variant', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'accurate diagnosis', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genomic signature', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput technology', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'mutation carrier', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'protein function', 'screening', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'tumorigenic']",NICHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,45016,0.17979684019887607
"Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome Project Summary Congenital ataxia presents in early childhood with non-progressive hypotonia, gross motor, fine motor and cognitive delays. These disorders are distinct from the progressive ataxias because of the presence of congenital cerebellar malformations and because they are typically inherited recessively. Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) constitute a major subset of these conditions, consisting of a cerebellar midline (vermis) malformation, a nearly pathognomonic Molar Tooth sign on brain Imaging (MTI) and co-existent oculomotor apraxia and episodic breathing dysrhythmias. In our published data, we have: 1] Identified ten unique genetic causes of JSRD (nearly half of the published causes), 2] Generated genotype-phenotype correlations involving cerebellar, retinal, renal, hepatic, digit, and cerebral manifestations. 3] Identified common founder mutations that allow for population-based screening. 4] Discovered that JSRD encoded proteins frequently localize to the cilium. 5] Identified ciliary transition zone (TZ) defects in cells with JSRD mutations. 6] Performed siRNA cell-based screens for defective ciliogenesis to prioritize candidate JSRD genes. 7] Generated and characterized multiple zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models for JSRD. 8] Defined the concept of ‘Ciliary localization’ model, in which one JSRD gene is required for ciliary localization of other JSRD proteins. In our unpublished data we have: 1] Recruited an additional 200 JSRD patients without molecular diagnosis. 2] Performed whole exome (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on an additional 100 JSRD families. 3] Identified an additional 12 novel likely JSRD candidate genes. 4] Generated IPSCs and cerebellar organoids from mutation-positive and negative families to aid in functional analysis and gene discovery using RNAseq. 5] Begun functional validation of the putative mutations. 6] Developed methods to interrogate ciliary structure in a high-throughput fashion with electron microscopy (EM). The goal of this competing renewal is to identify the remaining ‘discoverable’ genes that lead to JSRD when lost, functionally validate mutations within the pathogenetic framework, and test the hypothesis that mutations in JSRD genes lead to collapse of the ciliary TZ. Because the majority of patients still have unknown cause of disease, this renewal aims to advance knowledge through molecular characterization of new genes, using newly evolving high-throughput techniques, integrated bioinformatics, and a unique resource of consanguineous families recruited world-wide. We further aim to validate these mutations in patient cells, within a mechanistic framework that JSRD genes are required for essential ciliary structural components during cerebellar development.

"Computational approaches for identifying epigenomic contexts of somatic mutations ABSTRACT During normal development, aging, and diseases such as cancer, DNA damage due to endogenous and external factors, and repair defects result in accumulation of different types of somatic mutations including single nucleotide substitutions, small InDels, copy number alterations, translocations, and ploidy changes. While a vast majority of somatic mutations in the genome are not disease drivers, their patterns of genetic changes and associated context can provide insights into past exposure to mutagens, mechanisms of DNA damage and repair defects, and extent of genomic instability, which are important for understanding disease etiology, minimizing hazardous environmental exposure, and also predicting efficacy of emerging treatment strategies such as immunotherapy. A number of mutation signatures have been identified based on local sequence contexts to address this need. But, mechanisms of DNA damage and repair preferences depend on both local sequence and epigenomic contexts, and it remains to be understood whether epigenomic contexts of emerging mutation signatures can provide critical, complementary etiological insights at a genome-wide scale, which are not apparent from sequence contexts alone. This is of fundamental importance, because (i) etiology of many of the emerging mutation signatures is currently unknown, (ii) DNA damage response and repair depends on tissue contexts, and defects in core DNA repair genes often result in cancer development in tissue-specific manner, and (iii) differences in the extent of DNA damage and repair between stem and differentiated cells within the same tissues have consequences for aging and disease incidence rates. Built logically on our previous works, we propose to develop computational approaches to determine the impact of epigenomic contexts on the patterns of somatic mutations within and across tissue types, and validate computational predictions using targeted experiments. In Aim-1, we will develop an epigenomic context preference map for emerging mutation signatures. In Aim-2, we will determine the basis of tissue-dependent differences in mutation profiles attributed to DNA repair defects. In Aim-3, we will predict the extent of cell lineage-dependent patterns of mutation accumulation from the mutational landscape of terminal cells. I am currently an early stage investigator, and the proposal is aligned with my long-term goal to identify fundamental principles of mutability and evolvability of somatic genomes. Our project will deliver novel resources and knowledge for addressing questions regarding genomic integrity during development and aging, and diseases such as cancer. ! PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will use computational biology approaches to determine epigenomic context preference for somatic mutations, and use that to infer tissue-dependent changes in mutation patterns. Our results will provide fundamental insights into aspects of genome maintenance, which is important for advancing our understanding of cancer etiology, reducing exposure to mutagenic factors, and also predicting efficacy of emerging treatment strategies. !",Computational approaches for identifying epigenomic contexts of somatic mutations,9737246,R01GM129066,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Relapse', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Gene', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Location', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutagens', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Ploidies', 'Point Mutation', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Stem cells', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer genomics', 'computer framework', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome integrity', 'genome-wide', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'markov model', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'repaired', 'response', 'stem', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,RBHS -CANCER INSTITUTE OF NEW JERSEY,R01,2019,336177,0.06308118980769599
"Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations Project Summary Although a quickly expanding catalogue of protein mutations have been discovered, including those that cause human diseases or confer drug resistance, mechanistic understanding and prediction of functional consequences of these mutations remain rather limited. There is a critical need to develop novel, multiscale computational frameworks that are rigorous and generalizable to help close the ever-increasing gap between phenotypic data and mechanistic knowledge about the mutations and to develop effective therapeutic strategies.  My long-term research goals are two folds: (1) to unravel how a change in protein sequence ripples through various aspects of molecular and system-levels to a change in cellular function and cause human diseases or confer drug resistance; and (2) to translate learned mechanistic knowledge to effective drug-design strategies for human diseases and drug resistance. Toward these goals I propose to advance and combine the strengths of computational molecular biology (structural modeling and design for proteins or protein interactions) and computational systems biology (pathway/network-level topology and dynamics) and follow a novel, formal paradigm to develop methods that systematically identify mechanisms underlying various stages of consequence propagation (from conformation, molecular and system-level variables, to cellular functions, where intermediates can be skipped if necessary). In the forward direction of propagating consequences, I will determine, explain and understand mutational consequences at various levels with machine learning, causal analysis, and combinatorial optimization, starting with known or modelled changes at various levels. In the inverse direction of designing consequences, I will follow known or learned mechanistic hypotheses and develop efficient combinatorial optimization methods to design mutagenesis experiments or screen / design ligands for desired perturbations at various levels, which would test and refine corresponding hypotheses directly and translate mechanistic hypotheses to therapeutic strategies. Mechanisms underlying distal (potentially allosteric) mutations, multiple mutations within a protein or across proteins as well as systems pharmacology strategies will also be rigorously determined in the process.  The expected outcomes from the innovative project will include two main components. The first will be both biophysical principles of proteins and integrative understanding of biomedical systems, which will be organized in a database for public access. The second will be translating mechanistic insights into therapeutic intervention strategies to treat diseases. In particular, targeted experiments (mutagenesis or ligand-binding) will be designed following known or discovered mechanistic hypotheses. This project will involve close collaboration with structural biologists and clinician-scientists who are active collaborators of the PI. Project Narrative Genetic mutations, many of which lead to protein mutations, are often associated with human diseases: they often directly cause diseases or contribute to their progressions. Understanding mechanisms by which these mutations lead to significant functional consequences is of extreme importance to developing effective therapeutics to cure diseases and ameliorate drug resistance.",Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations,9564155,R35GM124952,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biophysics', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Distal', 'Drug Design', 'Drug resistance', 'Goals', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacology', 'Process', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structural Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'phenotypic data']",NIGMS,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R35,2018,335245,0.11250081240178653
"The Evolution of Gene Regulation and Human Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Genetic variants that disrupt the functionality of regulatory sequences, and thereby alter gene expression levels, are major contributors to both evolutionary divergence between species and differences in risk for complex disease among humans. However, due to the complexity of the gene regulatory programs encoded in mammalian genomes and their rapid turnover between species, evaluating the function of non-protein-coding mutations is challenging. This is a major roadblock to tracing the evolution of human-specific biology. In addition, since the majority of disease-associated variants are non-coding, it impairs our ability to map the genetics of complex disease.  The long-term mission of my lab is to interpret the complex gene regulatory programs encoded in the human genome and accurately model the effects of genetic mutations to these elements on phenotypes relevant to disease and human evolution. We work toward these goals by integrating cutting-edge machine learning, statistical modeling of evolution, and the analysis of genotypes and phenotypes from large-scale clinical biobanks. In particular, my lab is uniquely well positioned to build on our previous work to address the following fundamental questions:  1. How have evolutionary transitions on the human-lineage modified the genome—in particular gene  regulatory programs—to produce human-specific biology? And how do these modifications relate to  human-specific disease risk?  2. What are the combinatorial rules underlying how TF binding patterns specify precise control of gene  regulation? And how do these gene regulatory “programs” evolve between species?  3. How do genetic and epigenetic mechanisms interact to specify the dynamic gene regulatory programs  that drive cellular development? And how are these programs perturbed in disease?  4. How can we interpret non-protein-coding mutations identified in patient genomes to inform treatment  and preventative care? Our work will produce much-needed methods for understanding the effects of mutations to gene regulatory regions and identify mutations responsible for differences in disease risk between human populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The genetic mutations that distinguish humans from other great apes and that influence risk for complex disease are mostly found outside of genes. Many of these mutations influence when and where genes are expressed. However, we do not know how to interpret the effects of most such mutations on gene regulation, disease risk, or human evolution, we will develop computational models that leverage machine learning, evolutionary patterns, and large-scale clinical biobanks to identify mutations that disrupt proper control of genes and lead to disease.",The Evolution of Gene Regulation and Human Disease,9486376,R35GM127087,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Impairment', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pongidae', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive care', 'Regulator Genes', 'Risk', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Models', 'To specify', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biobank', 'cellular development', 'combinatorial', 'disorder risk', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'mammalian genome', 'programs', 'species difference']",NIGMS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R35,2018,226333,0.08132676794896912
"Computational evaluation of the causal role of somatic mutations in human aging Project Abstract Although genome instability has long been considered as one of the major causal factors of aging, little is known about the actual number of genome alterations per cell and their effects on aging organisms, most notably humans. In the research proposed here I will take a single cell approach to identify the most common types of somatic mutations, i.e., base substitutions, small INDELS, copy number variation, genome structural variation and retrotranspositions, in human B lymphocytes as a function of age. The overarching goal is then to estimate functional effects of these DNA mutations accumulated during human aging in this particular cell type, which will also serve as a model for studying somatic mutations and their consequences in other cell types. This could never be tested before, because it was never possible to analyze random somatic mutations in a tissue by sequencing bulk DNA from that tissue (mutations are low- abundant), I will achieve this goal by utilizing a new, single-cell, whole genome sequencing (SCWGS) protocol that we developed. In this project I will focus on human B lymphocytes from individuals varying in age from about 30 to over 100 years and determine the genome-wide frequency and location of the different types of mutations in multiple cells from each individual (Aim 1). Preliminary results already show a significant increase of both base substitution mutations and CNVs with age, with a substantial number of these mutations in B cell genomic regions that are potentially functional. Hence, in Aim 2 I will predict the actual functional effects of these potentially functional, age-related mutations using machine learning approaches and integrative network analysis. Finally, in Aim 3 I will empirically test these predictions as to whether the mutation loads observed affect B cell's ability of response to stimulus. Hence, to test the long-standing hypothesis of genome instability as a causal factor in aging ,I will determine age-related mutations in single cells at four levels: (1) number of mutations, mutation spectra and genome distribution in individual cells; (2) potential functional effects of individual mutations, i.e., non-synonymous mutations in exons and mutations in gene regulatory regions; (3) mutations collectively affecting the gene regulatory network; and (4) relationship between mutation load and B cell activation status. In summary, the results of the proposed project will, for the first time uncover possible direct functional effects of somatic mutations on cellular function. Project Narrative Genome instability is considered as one of the major factors of aging and age-related diseases. This research aims to study somatic DNA mutations in normal blood cells (B lymphocytes) of humans of different ages and evaluate the functional effect of these mutations. It will dramatically improve the knowledge of DNA mutations in aging and deepen the understanding of genome instability as a basic aging mechanism in human.",Computational evaluation of the causal role of somatic mutations in human aging,9527264,K99AG056656,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', '5&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'B-Cell Activation', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding Sites', 'Blood Cells', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Centenarian', 'Code', 'Collecting Cell', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Replication Damage', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'DNA amplification', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enhancers', 'Evaluation', 'Exons', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomic Segment', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunization', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Locus Control Region', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Mutation Spectra', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA amplification', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Retrotransposition', 'Role', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Somatic Cell', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Study models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'age related', 'base', 'cell type', 'crosslink', 'dietary restriction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'promoter', 'repair enzyme', 'repaired', 'response', 'single cell sequencing', 'single cell technology', 'theories', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NIA,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",K99,2018,40760,0.1805365329197589
"Predicting Transcriptional and Epigenetic Networks in Cancer from Sequencing Data Limitless replicative potential is a key hallmark of cancer and critically depends on telomere maintenance. Many cancers thus aberrantly reactivate the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), a catalytic subunit of the telomerase complex that elongates telomere. It has been recently discovered that this common path to immortality in multiple cancers is through two activating point mutations in the TERT promoter (TERTp), found in more than 50 different cancer types, often at strikingly high frequencies, e.g. roughly 83% in glioblastomas (GBM) and 71% in melanomas. In the previous funding period, the PI has identified the molecular function of these highly recurrent mutations, demonstrating that the transcription factor (TF) GABP binds the mutant TERTp with exquisite specificity, but not the wild-type TERTp. The high prevalence of TERTp mutations across multiple cancer types and the selectivity of GABP recruitment to mutant TERTp thus provide an unprecedented opportunity for treating a large number of cancer patients with minimal toxicity to healthy cells. Despite the clear significance of this opportunity, however, several important questions surrounding the molecular functions and modulators of TERTp mutations remain poorly understood, hindering the development of effective and safe therapeutic strategies.  Our long-term goal is to establish a rigorous computational framework for understanding the aberrant transcriptional and epigenetic networks in cancers and to apply the resulting knowledge to devise novel therapeutic strategies that account for the genetic background of individual patients and that can a priori predict and avoid potential resistance mechanisms. The objective of our current renewal proposal is to develop powerful computational methods for transforming our knowledge about the non-coding TERTp mutations into an effective and safe molecular target. At the same time, the resulting methods will help resolve several outstanding challenges in the field of transcriptional gene regulation and have broad applications in cancer genomics. We will accomplish our objective my pursuing the following Aims: (1) Develop and test a computational framework for inferring sequence features that determine the distinct and shared binding patterns of paralogous TFs; (2) Develop and validate integrative tools for discovering the molecular basis of genetic interactions between germline variations and oncogenic mutations; (3) Develop and apply computational methods for studying the role of DNA helical phase between adjacent binding motifs in recruiting ETS factors to chromatin; (4) Perform a systematic genomic characterization of the effects of knocking out GABPB1L in TERTp-mutant cancer cells and healthy cells. The results of this proposal will have a broad impact on cancer research by providing powerful tools for studying paralogous oncogenic TFs and revealing novel insights into a highly promising therapeutic strategy. The proposed research will provide computational and bioinformatic resources for studying the binding pattern of paralogous oncogenic transcription factors. It will provide a computational framework for inferring the function of non-coding regulatory mutations and studying their interaction with common genetic variants. As an important application, we will systematically analyze a novel therapeutic strategy that has the potential to treat effectively a large number of patients across multiple cancer types harboring the recently discovered TERT promoter mutations.",Predicting Transcriptional and Epigenetic Networks in Cancer from Sequencing Data,9472091,R01CA163336,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug resistance', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specificity', 'TERT gene', 'Techniques', 'Telomerase', 'Telomere Maintenance', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bioinformatics resource', 'c-myc Genes', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer type', 'computer framework', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'dimer', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'knowledge of results', 'melanoma', 'member', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'resistance mechanism', 'telomere', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'treatment response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2018,327546,0.11864351204174775
"ADPKD: Disease Spectrum & Genotype-Phenotype Correlations Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common monoallelic disorder associated with progressive cyst development and resulting in end stage renal failure (ESRD) in 50% of patients by 60y. However, there is considerable phenotypic variability, extending from in utero onset to patients with adequate renal function into old age. Autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD), as traditionally defined, results in PLD with minimal renal cysts. Classically there have been considered two ADPKD genes, PKD1 and PKD2, encoding PC1 and PC2, and two ADPLD genes, PRKCSH and SEC63, but in the past few years greater genetic heterogeneity has been described, with nine genes now implicated overall. Recent data also indicates an overlap in etiology and pathogenesis associated with ADPKD and ADPLD, with the efficient biogenesis and localization of the PC-complex central to both disorders. During the last funding period we identified a novel gene, GANAB, which is associated with both disorders, where the encoded protein, GII is involved in the maturation and trafficking of PC1.  In this proposal we will take advantage of advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) methodologies, and large populations of ADPKD and ADPLD patients that have been assembled and screened for the classic genes, to hunt for novel genes for these disorders (Aim 1). The phenotype associated with these genes will be characterized (Aim 3) along with their mechanism of action (Aim 2). NGS methods will be perfected to screen the segmentally duplicated locus, PKD1, and to identify missed mutations at the known loci, including those present in just some cells due to mosaicism (Aim 1). The significance of many PKD1 nontruncating variants has been difficult to evaluate (classed as variants of unknown significance; VUS), but recently evidence that some are incompletely penetrant alleles partially explains phenotypic variability in PKD1 populations. In Aim 2 improved in silico predictions, in combination with machine learning, will improve the understanding of the pathogenicity and penetrance of VUS. A cellular assay of the biogenesis and trafficking of this PC-complex will also be employed to quantify the penetrance of VUS. The mechanism of pathogenesis will be explored in animal models with ultralow penetrant (ULP) Pkd1 or Pkd2 alleles. Employing the large clinically, imaging, and genetically well-defined populations phenotypic groupings of patients will be defined that will then be compared to the genic and PKD1 allelic groups (Aim 3). This iterative process will allow the Variant Score (VS) associated with each PKD1 VUS to be refined. In a separate population the revised VS, alone and in combination with clinical, functional, and imaging data, will be employed to generate a comprehensive, predictive algorithm for ADPKD (Aim 3). Disease modifiers to severe disease, via biallelic ADPKD, and due to alleles at other loci will also be identified and characterized in the cellular assay and in vivo in combination with the Pkd1 hypomorphic, RC model. The final aim will exploit the newly identified information that some PKD1 and PKD2 VUS are rescuable, folding mutations that in a maturation-fostering environment can traffic and function appropriately. A screening scheme based on the level of cell surface PC1 will be improved and new chaperone drugs specific for the PC complex will be sought in collaboration with Sanford Burnham Prebys. A second mutation group that will be explored therapeutically are nonsense mutations. A cellular assay for readthrough efficiency is being developed and will be used for screening. Identified chaperone or readthrough drugs will be tested in available mouse models. Overall this proposal will better explain the etiology and the genetic causes of phenotypic variability in ADPKD/ADPLD, develop better prognostic tools for individual selection of patients for treatment that are now becoming available, and explore allele based treatments for ADPKD. ADPKD and ADPLD are genetic diseases associated with cyst development and loss of function in the kidney and liver cysts, where the disease severity varies greatly between patients.

"Molecular impact of mutations in monogenic disease and cancer ABSTRACT  Next generation genome scale sequencing of patients is now becoming routine for two classes of disease: rare  Mendelian traits and cancer. In favorable cases, these data allow identification of relevant mutations and thus  aid diagnosis and therapy. In both classes of disease, the most common type of mutation is missense -­ single  base  changes  that  result  in  an  amino  acid  substitution  in  a  protein.  Uncertainty  as  to  the  impact  of  these  mutations on in vivo protein activity has resulted in a very conservative approach to their interpretation in the  clinic,  so  causing  many  missed  opportunities  for  targeted  treatment.  The  goal  of  this  project  is  to  use  a  combination of three strategies to make the interpretation of these mutations much more applicable in the clinic.  There are already a large number of computational methods that attempt to determine the impact of missense  mutations on function, and there is substantial evidence that these have useful accuracy. The primary difficulty  is that the accuracy in any particular case is not reliably calibrated. Therefore, our first aim is to use a combination  of these methods to develop an approach focused on more reliable estimates for the probability of high impact  on  protein  function  (i.e.  more  confident  P  values).  The  second  aim  is  to  maximize  the  utilization  of  three-­ dimensional structural information, largely ignored by most computational methods. A large fraction of missense  mutations in these classes of disease act by destabilizing protein structure and knowledge of structure allows  these to be identified with much higher reliability. Also, structure provides a framework for detailed annotation  and comprehension of function. To facilitate the utilization of structure, we will implement a modeling platform  that leverages available experimental information to maximize the structural data available for analyzing mutation  impact.  An  important  aspect  of  the  platform  is  incorporation  of  methods  for  evaluating  the  reliability  of  the  structural features relevant to analysis of each mutation. In the third aim we will build specific functional models  for each protein of interest, integrating information from current databases, the literature, and community input,  so as to provide the richest possible background against which to judge the impact of mutations. Proteopedia, a  well established media wiki for proteins, will be used to provide an integrated view of text, data, and structure. A  key component of the information resource will be contributions from curators, who will provide annotation and  also solicit input from other experts. This aspect of the project builds on experience with other crowdsourcing  endeavors,  including  CASP,  CAGI  and  Proteopedia.    There  will  be  three  primary  outcomes  from  the  project:  First, improved reliability for the interpretation of missense mutations. Second, a prototype mutation annotation  procedure suitable for use in a clinical setting. Third, the resource will provide information of benefit to a range  of other scientists, thus facilitating the analysis of disease related mutations.      NARRATIVE  Genome  scale  DNA  sequencing  is  now  contributing  to  diagnosis  and  therapy  in  cases  of  rare  human  disease and cancer.  Full exploitation of these data is currently hampered by inadequate understanding  of which DNA changes affect protein function so as to contribute to disease. This project aims to develop  the methods and tools needed to remove that obstacle. ",Molecular impact of mutations in monogenic disease and cancer,9504498,R01GM120364,"['AIDS diagnosis', 'AIDS therapy', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Text', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'crowdsourcing', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'next generation', 'primary outcome', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'prototype', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'wiki']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2018,336086,0.1299166310600265

"Massively parallel functional analyses of human PTEN variants Project Summary  We are now able to routinely sequence human genomes at single-base resolution. However, our ability to interpret the functional consequences of detected mutations has lagged behind. Computational approaches scale well but have poor accuracy, whereas retrospective analysis of detected variants has high accuracy but does not scale well. In order to solve this problem, a new experimental paradigm has emerged to empirically characterize the effects of mutations with high accuracy at scale. This approach takes advantage of recent and ongoing improvements in DNA synthesis and sequencing, and has the potential to offer unprecedented insight into protein biochemistry and human disease. We believe these insights will prove to be critical for unlocking the potential of genomic medicine.  In this project we seek to comprehensively assess multiple molecular effects of PTEN mutations on protein function, and assess the utility of this data as a predictor for human clinical phenotype. The PTEN protein is a tumor suppressor that is frequently mutated in diverse human cancers and in the germline of some individuals with overgrowth disorders, cancer predisposition syndromes, or autism. Currently, it is impossible to predict the effects of the vast majority of PTEN germline mutations. Since the phenotypic spectrum of PTEN mutation carriers is broad, it would be highly valuable to understand the ways in which phenotypic outcomes arise from PTEN mutation genotypes.  In Aim 1, we will first employ a yeast-based screen to assess the effects all PTEN single amino acid mutations on lipid phosphatase activity, the primary biochemical function of PTEN protein. It is known that several pathogenic variants are destabilized. Therefore, in Aim 2, we will perform a second, independent screen to assess the steady state protein stability of all PTEN single amino acid mutations. In Aim 3, we will use the data derived from this study as well as publically available biochemical information to train a classifier model to predict the relationship between the mutation genotypes and clinical phenotypes observed in humans. These data will increase our fundamental understanding of PTEN function and the role of mutations in diverse disorders, and could provide a valuable clinical tool that would increase the quality of life for PTEN mutation carriers. Project Narrative  Mutations in the gene PTEN are causal for a diverse set of clinical disorders ranging from cancer to autism spectrum disorder. Here, we seek to gain new fundamental insights into the functional relationships between PTEN mutations and clinical presentations by prospectively characterizing the effects of all single amino acid PTEN mutations in parallel. These data will allow the creation of new models that can predict risk of specific PTEN mutations for different clinical outcomes and potentially lead to personalized therapies, early interventions, and optimal outcomes for PTEN mutation carriers.",Massively parallel functional analyses of human PTEN variants,9539482,F31HD095571,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'PTEN gene', 'PTEN protein', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphatidylinositols', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Protein Biochemistry', 'Proteins', 'Pythons', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitination', 'Variant', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'accurate diagnosis', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genomic signature', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput technology', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'mutation carrier', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'protein function', 'screening', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'tumorigenic']",NICHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,44524,0.17979684019887607
"A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions Project summary There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how mutations are preferentially targeted to the variable (V) regions of the Immunoglobulin (Ig) loci during somatic hypermutation (SHM). The persistence of this gap has limited our understanding of the mutagenic mechanisms involving activation-induced deaminase (AID) in the immune response and in the role of AID in mis-targeting mutations leading to B-cell lymphomas and other cancers. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand the global targeting of mutations in immunity that are required to protect us from infections. As high-throughput data from human antibody immune responses became available, it provided us with new opportunities to generate hypotheses to explain the underlying mechanisms of SHM. We now propose to generate further hypotheses using computational models applied to additional databases and to validate these hypotheses using cellular and animal experiments. Our objective is to understand what directs SHM across the many human Ig heavy chain V-regions. Our central hypothesis is that the V-region SHM process is highly dependent on a DNA sequence signature(s) that drives mutations in a largely deterministic fashion. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary results using human in vivo data from a few human V region genes and has begun to be validated using independent databases and experiments in human B cell lines. The rationale is that evaluations of computational data based upon biological mechanisms, together with appropriate biological experiments, will reveal the key differences between IGHV regions (IGHV 3-23, 4-34, 1-18, 1-02, etc.) that lead to the dominance of each of those V regions in the responses to medically important antigens. Our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) identify the extent to which a DNA signature determines the mutation process in four individual human IGHV genes that are important in disease responses; 2) examine the relationship between AID hotspots and Polη hotspots across all the other human V region genes, thus rigorously defining a mutation targeting signature. Both aims will also entail studying human V region genes and modifications of them in human cell lines and in mice expressing a human V region to further confirm the signature and identify molecular mechanisms in vivo. Our approach is innovative because the computational models we are proposing will be mechanistically motivated focusing on the interaction between AID and Polη hotspots, thus testing molecular mechanisms as opposed to classic statistical models using whole V region sequences that ignore the underlying biology. In addition, to focus on mechanisms we will leverage new high-throughput data from human V regions that have not undergone antigen selection. Our results will be highly relevant to human IgV repertoire analyses from immune responses that are currently hard to interpret and will help future vaccine and therapeutic antibody development, as well as help to understand mutations in human malignancies where AID plays a key role. Project narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the targeting of AID-mediated mutations across many human heavy chain V-regions will make it possible to develop vaccines that will lead more rapidly to better and more broadly protective antibodies to infectious agents and reveal the risk factors in the development of B-cell malignancies and gastric and other solid tumors where AID is implicated.",A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions,9518337,R01AI132507,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Experiments', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmunity', 'B lymphoid malignancy', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Gene-Modified', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Heavy-Chain Immunoglobulins', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Knock-in', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stomach', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'activation-induced cytidine deaminase', 'base', 'chromatin modification', 'density', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'human data', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'innovation', 'neutralizing antibody', 'recruit', 'repair enzyme', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'vaccine response']",NIAID,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2018,537909,0.12175547856311676
"Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome Project Summary Congenital ataxia presents in early childhood with non-progressive hypotonia, gross motor, fine motor and cognitive delays. These disorders are distinct from the progressive ataxias because of the presence of congenital cerebellar malformations and because they are typically inherited recessively. Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) constitute a major subset of these conditions, consisting of a cerebellar midline (vermis) malformation, a nearly pathognomonic Molar Tooth sign on brain Imaging (MTI) and co-existent oculomotor apraxia and episodic breathing dysrhythmias. In our published data, we have: 1] Identified ten unique genetic causes of JSRD (nearly half of the published causes), 2] Generated genotype-phenotype correlations involving cerebellar, retinal, renal, hepatic, digit, and cerebral manifestations. 3] Identified common founder mutations that allow for population-based screening. 4] Discovered that JSRD encoded proteins frequently localize to the cilium. 5] Identified ciliary transition zone (TZ) defects in cells with JSRD mutations. 6] Performed siRNA cell-based screens for defective ciliogenesis to prioritize candidate JSRD genes. 7] Generated and characterized multiple zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models for JSRD. 8] Defined the concept of ‘Ciliary localization’ model, in which one JSRD gene is required for ciliary localization of other JSRD proteins. In our unpublished data we have: 1] Recruited an additional 200 JSRD patients without molecular diagnosis. 2] Performed whole exome (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on an additional 100 JSRD families. 3] Identified an additional 12 novel likely JSRD candidate genes. 4] Generated IPSCs and cerebellar organoids from mutation-positive and negative families to aid in functional analysis and gene discovery using RNAseq. 5] Begun functional validation of the putative mutations. 6] Developed methods to interrogate ciliary structure in a high-throughput fashion with electron microscopy (EM). The goal of this competing renewal is to identify the remaining ‘discoverable’ genes that lead to JSRD when lost, functionally validate mutations within the pathogenetic framework, and test the hypothesis that mutations in JSRD genes lead to collapse of the ciliary TZ. Because the majority of patients still have unknown cause of disease, this renewal aims to advance knowledge through molecular characterization of new genes, using newly evolving high-throughput techniques, integrated bioinformatics, and a unique resource of consanguineous families recruited world-wide. We further aim to validate these mutations in patient cells, within a mechanistic framework that JSRD genes are required for essential ciliary structural components during cerebellar development. Project Narrative Joubert syndrome is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder unified by defects of the cellular primary cilium.

"Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations Project Summary Although a quickly expanding catalogue of protein mutations have been discovered, including those that cause human diseases or confer drug resistance, mechanistic understanding and prediction of functional consequences of these mutations remain rather limited. There is a critical need to develop novel, multiscale computational frameworks that are rigorous and generalizable to help close the ever-increasing gap between phenotypic data and mechanistic knowledge about the mutations and to develop effective therapeutic strategies.  My long-term research goals are two folds: (1) to unravel how a change in protein sequence ripples through various aspects of molecular and system-levels to a change in cellular function and cause human diseases or confer drug resistance; and (2) to translate learned mechanistic knowledge to effective drug-design strategies for human diseases and drug resistance. Toward these goals I propose to advance and combine the strengths of computational molecular biology (structural modeling and design for proteins or protein interactions) and computational systems biology (pathway/network-level topology and dynamics) and follow a novel, formal paradigm to develop methods that systematically identify mechanisms underlying various stages of consequence propagation (from conformation, molecular and system-level variables, to cellular functions, where intermediates can be skipped if necessary). In the forward direction of propagating consequences, I will determine, explain and understand mutational consequences at various levels with machine learning, causal analysis, and combinatorial optimization, starting with known or modelled changes at various levels. In the inverse direction of designing consequences, I will follow known or learned mechanistic hypotheses and develop efficient combinatorial optimization methods to design mutagenesis experiments or screen / design ligands for desired perturbations at various levels, which would test and refine corresponding hypotheses directly and translate mechanistic hypotheses to therapeutic strategies. Mechanisms underlying distal (potentially allosteric) mutations, multiple mutations within a protein or across proteins as well as systems pharmacology strategies will also be rigorously determined in the process.  The expected outcomes from the innovative project will include two main components. The first will be both biophysical principles of proteins and integrative understanding of biomedical systems, which will be organized in a database for public access. The second will be translating mechanistic insights into therapeutic intervention strategies to treat diseases. In particular, targeted experiments (mutagenesis or ligand-binding) will be designed following known or discovered mechanistic hypotheses.

"Molecular impact of mutations in monogenic disease and cancer ABSTRACT  Next generation genome scale sequencing of patients is now becoming routine for two classes of disease: rare  Mendelian traits and cancer. In favorable cases, these data allow identification of relevant mutations and thus  aid diagnosis and therapy. In both classes of disease, the most common type of mutation is missense -­ single  base  changes  that  result  in  an  amino  acid  substitution  in  a  protein.  Uncertainty  as  to  the  impact  of  these  mutations on in vivo protein activity has resulted in a very conservative approach to their interpretation in the  clinic,  so  causing  many  missed  opportunities  for  targeted  treatment.  The  goal  of  this  project  is  to  use  a  combination of three strategies to make the interpretation of these mutations much more applicable in the clinic.  There are already a large number of computational methods that attempt to determine the impact of missense  mutations on function, and there is substantial evidence that these have useful accuracy. The primary difficulty  is that the accuracy in any particular case is not reliably calibrated. Therefore, our first aim is to use a combination  of these methods to develop an approach focused on more reliable estimates for the probability of high impact  on  protein  function  (i.e.  more  confident  P  values).  The  second  aim  is  to  maximize  the  utilization  of  three-­ dimensional structural information, largely ignored by most computational methods. A large fraction of missense  mutations in these classes of disease act by destabilizing protein structure and knowledge of structure allows  these to be identified with much higher reliability. Also, structure provides a framework for detailed annotation  and comprehension of function. To facilitate the utilization of structure, we will implement a modeling platform  that leverages available experimental information to maximize the structural data available for analyzing mutation  impact.  An  important  aspect  of  the  platform  is  incorporation  of  methods  for  evaluating  the  reliability  of  the  structural features relevant to analysis of each mutation. In the third aim we will build specific functional models  for each protein of interest, integrating information from current databases, the literature, and community input,  so as to provide the richest possible background against which to judge the impact of mutations. Proteopedia, a  well established media wiki for proteins, will be used to provide an integrated view of text, data, and structure. A  key component of the information resource will be contributions from curators, who will provide annotation and  also solicit input from other experts. This aspect of the project builds on experience with other crowdsourcing  endeavors,  including  CASP,  CAGI  and  Proteopedia.    There  will  be  three  primary  outcomes  from  the  project:  First, improved reliability for the interpretation of missense mutations. Second, a prototype mutation annotation  procedure suitable for use in a clinical setting. Third, the resource will provide information of benefit to a range  of other scientists, thus facilitating the analysis of disease related mutations.      NARRATIVE  Genome  scale  DNA  sequencing  is  now  contributing  to  diagnosis  and  therapy  in  cases  of  rare  human  disease and cancer.  Full exploitation of these data is currently hampered by inadequate understanding  of which DNA changes affect protein function so as to contribute to disease. This project aims to develop  the methods and tools needed to remove that obstacle. ",Molecular impact of mutations in monogenic disease and cancer,9356560,R01GM120364,"['AIDS diagnosis', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Text', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'crowdsourcing', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'next generation', 'primary outcome', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'prototype', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'wiki']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2017,343120,0.1299166310600265
"Functional Annotation of Natural and Disease Variants in Tryosine Kinases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein tyrosine kinases are dynamic molecular switches that toggle between a catalytically ""on"" and ""off"" state to turn on and off signals responsible for cell growth and survival. While the tyrosine kinase switch is tightly regulated by  diverse array of structural mechanisms in normal states, in many disease states, the switch is permanently turned on or off due, in part, to mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain. Although genome sequencing studies have revealed the mutational patterns of tyrosine kinases from many different disease types, understanding the structural and functional impact of these mutations is a challenge because many recurrent mutations occur far from the active site (distal mutations) and the residue networks that contribute to the complex modes of tyrosine kinase allosteric regulation are not fully understood. Our long term goal is to understand the relationships connecting sequence, structure, function, regulation and disease in protein kinases using a combination of computational and experimental approaches. Our objective in this proposal, which is the next logical step toward attainment of our long-term goal, is to delineate the residue interaction networks that contribute to the unique modes of allosteric regulation in tyrosine kinases, and to develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact using the evolutionary and allosteric properties encoded in three dimensional structures. The central hypothesis is that distal mutations alter evolutionarily conserved allosteric networks in tyrosine kinases, and delineating the allosteric networks unique to tyrosine kinases will provide context for predicting and testing disease mutation impact. The specific aims are: * To identify and characterize natural sequence and structural variants associated with tight  allosteric control of tyrosine kinase activity * To develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact on kinase activation and to  experimentally validate computational predictions using selected receptor tyrosine kinases as  model systems Successful completion of these aims is expected to reveal novel activating mutations in putative allosteric sites in the tyrosine kinase domain, and pinpoint key residues and interactions for functional studies. These outcomes, in turn, are expected to have major biomedical impact by accelerating the functional characterization of the mutated tyrosine kinome, which is emerging as a major target for personalized medicine. Finally, by providing detailed mechanistic annotation of mutations identified in genome sequencing studies, this proposal will address a fundamental NIH roadmap problem in translational medicine of converting genomic discoveries into therapeutic strategies.

"Genomics-based prediction of antibiotic failure in S. aureus infections ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The Gram positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus is both an asymptomatic human colonizer and a pathogen that can cause infections in multiple tissue sites, including blood, skin and soft tissue, bone, and internal organs. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a common cause of death by hospital infections (HA-MRSA) and is now also a common community acquired infection (CA-MRSA). Vancomycin (a glycopeptide antibiotic) is the most commonly prescribed drug to treat MRSA infections. High-level resistance (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) ≥16 μg/ml) to vancomycin encoded by the mobile vanA gene is rare due to a fitness burden on S. aureus. However, it is more common to encounter strains with mutations conferring intermediate resistance to vancomycin arising from selection during the course of antibiotic therapy. The genetic basis of these vancomycin intermediate S. aureus (VISA) and heterogeneous resistant (hVISA) (MIC 2-8 μg/ml) strains involves a large number of different genomic mutations that result in cell wall thickening through changes in cellular signaling and regulation. Routine phenotypic testing in clinical labs probably underestimates the incidence of VISA and hVISA. Due to the fact that mutations in several genes have been linked with VISA, genetic-based detection of intermediate vancomycin resistance has not been developed for routine clinical microbiological use. In our preliminary work, we created an extensive catalog of sequenced clinical and laboratory-selected VISA as well as databases of SNPs and genetic variation in thousands of public S. aureus genomes. In this work we plan to extend these studies toward development of a sequence-based testing protocol that could be used for large numbers of clinical strains. In Specific Aim 1 we plan to extend our knowledge of the mutations that cause VISA by sequencing a panel of 300 novel mutants strains spontaneously selected from 40 S. aureus parent genotypes. We estimate, based on the results of the preliminary data, that this number of strains will be sufficient identify mutations found in 95% of VISA strains. These data will be used for creation of a comprehensive VISA detection assay based on whole genome data with an accuracy of at least 95%. In Specific Aim 2 we will use the information learned from Aim 1 to create a multiplex PCR sequence test for VISA, VRSA and other resistance determinants of S. aureus based on the commercially available Fluidigm platform. We will ultimately aim to have an assay that can be used to monitor systemic MRSA infections, such as bacteremia, to detect development of VISA in its early stages in clinical specimens from the patient. The test will also be able to detect other S. aureus resistance phenotypes and call the genotype of the strain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Vancomycin is an antibiotic commonly used to treat methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in chronically ill patients. The efficacy of this relatively cheap and well-tolerated therapy is compromised by mutations in the genome of the bacterium. In this project we propose to develop a genetic test based on a library of MRSA genome sequences with known antibiotic susceptibility level that identifies bacteria with diminished resistance to vancomycin.",Genomics-based prediction of antibiotic failure in S. aureus infections,9241329,R21AI121860,"['Address', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Catalogs', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Wall', 'Chronically Ill', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Community-Acquired Infections', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glycopeptide Antibiotics', 'Goals', 'Gram-Positive Bacteria', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Intermediate resistance', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methicillin', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Organ', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulation', 'Resistance', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin Tissue', 'Specimen', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'University Hospitals', 'Vancomycin', 'Vancomycin Resistance', 'Vancomycin-resistant S. aureus', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'design', 'economic cost', 'fitness', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'interest', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'mortality', 'mutant', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'phenotypic data', 'pleiotropism', 'public health relevance', 'soft tissue', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NIAID,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,195000,0.09206023846893976
"Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital ataxia presents in early childhood with non-progressive hypotonia, gross and fine motor delay and cognitive delays. These disorders are distinct from the progressive ataxias because of the presence of congenital cerebellar malformations and because they are typically inherited recessively. Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) constitute a major subset of these conditions, consisting of a cerebellar midline (vermis) malformation, a nearly pathognomonic Molar Tooth sign on brain Imaging (MTI) and co-existent oculomotor apraxia and episodic breathing dysrhythmias. In our published data, we have: 1] Identified ten unique genetic causes of JSRD (nearly half of the published causes), 2] Generated genotype-phenotype correlations involving cerebellar, retinal, renal, hepatic, digit, and cerebral manifestations. 3] Identified common founder mutations that allow for population-based screening. 4] Discovered that JSRD encoded proteins localize to the cilium. 5] Identified ciliary defects in cells with JSRD mutations. 6] Performed siRNA cell-based screens for defective ciliogenesis to prioritize candidate JSRD genes. 7] Generated and characterized multiple zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models for JSRD. 8] Defined the concept of `Ciliary localization' model, in which one JSRD gene is required for ciliary localization of other JSRD proteins. In our unpublished work we have: 1] Recruited an additional 200 JSRD patients without molecular diagnosis. 2] Performed whole exome sequencing (WES) and genetic mapping on an additional 100 JSRD families. 3] Identified an additional 12 novel likely JSRD candidate genes. 4] Begun functional validation of the putative mutations. 5] Developed methods to ultrastructurally interrogate ciliary structure in a high-throughput fashion. The goal of this competing renewal is to identify the remaining `discoverable' genes that when mutated lead to JSRD, functionally validate mutations within the pathogenetic framework, and test the hypothesis that mutations in any proven JSRD gene lead to collapse of the ciliary transition zone by correlating genetic mutations with ultrastructural ciliary defects. Because the majority of patients still have unknown cause of disease, this renewal aims to advance knowledge through molecular characterization of new genes, using newly evolving high-throughput techniques, integrated bioinformatics, and a unique resource of consanguineous families recruited world-wide. We further aim to validate these mutations within a mechanistic framework, and a model that JSRD genes are required for essential ciliary structural components during cerebellar development.

In Specific Aim 2 we will use the information learned from Aim 1 to create a multiplex PCR sequence test for VISA, VRSA and other resistance determinants of S. aureus based on the commercially available Fluidigm platform. We will ultimately aim to have an assay that can be used to monitor systemic MRSA infections, such as bacteremia, to detect development of VISA in its early stages in clinical specimens from the patient. The test will also be able to detect other S. aureus resistance phenotypes and call the genotype of the strain.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Vancomycin is an antibiotic commonly used to treat methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in chronically ill patients. The efficacy of this relatively cheap and well-tolerated therapy is compromised by mutations in the genome of the bacterium. In this project we propose to develop a genetic test based on a library of MRSA genome sequences with known antibiotic susceptibility level that identifies bacteria with diminished resistance to vancomycin.            ",Genomics-based prediction of antibiotic failure in S. aureus infections,9017369,R21AI121860,"['Address', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Wall', 'Chronically Ill', 'Clinical', 'Community-Acquired Infections', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glycopeptide Antibiotics', 'Goals', 'Gram-Positive Bacteria', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Intermediate resistance', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methicillin', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Organ', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulation', 'Resistance', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin Tissue', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'University Hospitals', 'Vancomycin', 'Vancomycin Resistance', 'Vancomycin-resistant S. aureus', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical sequencing', 'design', 'economic cost', 'fitness', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'interest', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'mortality', 'mutant', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pleiotropism', 'public health relevance', 'soft tissue', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NIAID,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,234000,0.09206023846893976
"Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome Project Summary Congenital ataxia presents in early childhood with non-progressive hypotonia, gross motor, fine motor and cognitive delays. These disorders are distinct from the progressive ataxias because of the presence of congenital cerebellar malformations and because they are typically inherited recessively. Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) constitute a major subset of these conditions, consisting of a cerebellar midline (vermis) malformation, a nearly pathognomonic Molar Tooth sign on brain Imaging (MTI) and co-existent oculomotor apraxia and episodic breathing dysrhythmias. In our published data, we have: 1] Identified ten unique genetic causes of JSRD (nearly half of the published causes), 2] Generated genotype-phenotype correlations involving cerebellar, retinal, renal, hepatic, digit, and cerebral manifestations. 3] Identified common founder mutations that allow for population-based screening. 4] Discovered that JSRD encoded proteins frequently localize to the cilium. 5] Identified ciliary transition zone (TZ) defects in cells with JSRD mutations. 6] Performed siRNA cell-based screens for defective ciliogenesis to prioritize candidate JSRD genes. 7] Generated and characterized multiple zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models for JSRD. 8] Defined the concept of ‘Ciliary localization’ model, in which one JSRD gene is required for ciliary localization of other JSRD proteins. In our unpublished data we have: 1] Recruited an additional 200 JSRD patients without molecular diagnosis. 2] Performed whole exome (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on an additional 100 JSRD families. 3] Identified an additional 12 novel likely JSRD candidate genes. 4] Generated IPSCs and cerebellar organoids from mutation-positive and negative families to aid in functional analysis and gene discovery using RNAseq. 5] Begun functional validation of the putative mutations. 6] Developed methods to interrogate ciliary structure in a high-throughput fashion with electron microscopy (EM). The goal of this competing renewal is to identify the remaining ‘discoverable’ genes that lead to JSRD when lost, functionally validate mutations within the pathogenetic framework, and test the hypothesis that mutations in JSRD genes lead to collapse of the ciliary TZ. Because the majority of patients still have unknown cause of disease, this renewal aims to advance knowledge through molecular characterization of new genes, using newly evolving high-throughput techniques, integrated bioinformatics, and a unique resource of consanguineous families recruited world-wide. We further aim to validate these mutations in patient cells, within a mechanistic framework that JSRD genes are required for essential ciliary structural components during cerebellar development. Project Narrative Joubert syndrome is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder unified by defects of the cellular primary cilium. This work will identify new genetic causes and dissect ciliary defects associated with genetic mutations.",Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome,9239923,R01NS048453,"['Apraxias', 'Ataxia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Brain imaging', 'Breathing', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar malformation', 'Cerebellar vermis structure', 'Cerebrum', 'Cilia', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Cognitive', 'Congenital cerebellar hypoplasia', 'Cultured Cells', 'Cytoplasmic Granules', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Embryo', 'Enrollment', 'Face', 'Family', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hepatic', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Joubert syndrome', 'Kidney', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Middle East', 'Modeling', 'Molar tooth', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Muscle hypotonia', 'Mutation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Organoids', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Resources', 'Retinal', 'Risk', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Termination of pregnancy', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Training', 'Transmission Electron Microscopy', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'accurate diagnosis', 'affection', 'base', 'cell type', 'cilium biogenesis', 'cohort', 'consanguineous family', 'disorder subtype', 'early childhood', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'fetal', 'founder mutation', 'gene discovery', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'loss of function mutation', 'malformation', 'mutant', 'novel', 'oculomotor', 'population based', 'reconstruction', 'screening', 'stem cell biology', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NINDS,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,557723,0.14568270627494084

"Developing integrative approaches for identifying disease-causing genes and dysfunctional networks ﻿    DESCRIPTION: Cancer is a consequence of the accumulation of genetic alterations. Large whole-genome scale resequencing projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have been launched in an effort to comprehensively catalog the genomic mutations and epigenetic modifications that are associated with cancer. It is essential to identify cancer-causing genes and pathways to gain insight into the disease mechanisms and hence facilitate early diagnosis and optimal treatment. However, identifying cancer-causing genes and their functional pathways remains challenging due to the complex biological interactions and the heterogeneity of diseases. Genetic mutations in disease-causing genes can disturb signaling pathways that impact the expression of a set of genes performing certain biological functions. We refer to a set of such genes as a functional module. We hypothesize that driver mutations, that is, mutations that lead to cancer progression, are likely to affect common disease-associated functional modules, and the causal relationship between the mutations and the perturbed signals of the modules can be reconstructed from gene expression data and protein interaction data. In this project, we will develop a novel approach to infer disease-causing genes and networks by integrating information from multiple types of data including genomic variations, gene expression and protein interactions. We first dynamically identify disease-associated modules that consist of a set of interacting genes, then develop a Bayesian-based approach to infer causative genes from the disease-associated modules. Then, by developing a stochastic search based method, we can determine the paths connecting causative genes and gene modules. As a result, disease- related pathways are inferred from the paths. Furthermore, we will integrate those pathways with the human interactome to discover higher-level disease-associated networks. In addition, we will develop machine learning based classifiers to predict disease types and clinical outcomes utilizing the molecular signatures identified in this project, such as differentially expressed gene modules and causative genes. Our computational framework and classifiers will be made available to the research community via a webserver. The PI serves as the university bioinformatics program director and has extensive teaching and research experience. A goal of this project is also to provide scientific research training to students and o help students to gain biological insight through their involvement with the project. Students will learn practical scientific computing skills from the PI and develop their own computational approaches to solving specific biomedical problems under the guidance of the PI. Thus the project will serve as an effective learning-research model in bioinformatics.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we will develop and implement a novel framework to identify causative mutations and pathways and study cancer disease mechanisms by reconstructing signaling pathways. This will help to advance personalized medicine and lead to a greater understanding of cancer mechanisms, which can lay the foundation for improving early diagnosis and treatment planning, as well as the discovery of new therapeutic targets.            ",Developing integrative approaches for identifying disease-causing genes and dysfunctional networks,8880075,R15GM114739,"['Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Foundations', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phosphorylation', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Recurrent disease', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Models', 'Students', 'System', 'Technology', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Universities', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer framework', 'differential expression', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic variation', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'prospective', 'protein protein interaction', 'public health relevance', 'scientific computing', 'skills', 'treatment planning', 'tumor progression']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS AT LITTLE ROCK,R15,2015,373520,0.06938346850469396
"Functional Annotation of Natural and Disease Variants in Tryosine Kinases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein tyrosine kinases are dynamic molecular switches that toggle between a catalytically ""on"" and ""off"" state to turn on and off signals responsible for cell growth and survival. While the tyrosine kinase switch is tightly regulated by  diverse array of structural mechanisms in normal states, in many disease states, the switch is permanently turned on or off due, in part, to mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain. Although genome sequencing studies have revealed the mutational patterns of tyrosine kinases from many different disease types, understanding the structural and functional impact of these mutations is a challenge because many recurrent mutations occur far from the active site (distal mutations) and the residue networks that contribute to the complex modes of tyrosine kinase allosteric regulation are not fully understood. Our long term goal is to understand the relationships connecting sequence, structure, function, regulation and disease in protein kinases using a combination of computational and experimental approaches. Our objective in this proposal, which is the next logical step toward attainment of our long-term goal, is to delineate the residue interaction networks that contribute to the unique modes of allosteric regulation in tyrosine kinases, and to develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact using the evolutionary and allosteric properties encoded in three dimensional structures. The central hypothesis is that distal mutations alter evolutionarily conserved allosteric networks in tyrosine kinases, and delineating the allosteric networks unique to tyrosine kinases will provide context for predicting and testing disease mutation impact. The specific aims are: * To identify and characterize natural sequence and structural variants associated with tight  allosteric control of tyrosine kinase activity * To develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact on kinase activation and to  experimentally validate computational predictions using selected receptor tyrosine kinases as  model systems Successful completion of these aims is expected to reveal novel activating mutations in putative allosteric sites in the tyrosine kinase domain, and pinpoint key residues and interactions for functional studies. These outcomes, in turn, are expected to have major biomedical impact by accelerating the functional characterization of the mutated tyrosine kinome, which is emerging as a major target for personalized medicine. Finally, by providing detailed mechanistic annotation of mutations identified in genome sequencing studies, this proposal will address a fundamental NIH roadmap problem in translational medicine of converting genomic discoveries into therapeutic strategies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein tyrosine kinases are a biomedically important class of proteins that are abnormally regulated in many human diseases including cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory disorders, to name but a few. They have been the focus of many drug discovery efforts and genome sequencing studies because of the therapeutic potential of targeting mutated tyrosine kinases for personalized therapy. By providing functional annotation of natural and disease mutations in tyrosine kinases, the proposed studies will accelerate the targeting of mutated tyrosine kinases for drug discovery and personalized therapy.            ",Functional Annotation of Natural and Disease Variants in Tryosine Kinases,8984471,R01GM114409,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Allosteric Regulation', 'Allosteric Site', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cell Survival', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Binding Site', 'Drug Regulations', 'Drug resistance', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammatory', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Property', 'Protein Kinase', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tyrosine', 'Tyrosine Kinase Domain', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell growth', 'computer framework', 'drug discovery', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'molecular dynamics', 'mutant', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'public health relevance', 'three dimensional structure', 'translational medicine']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2015,300000,0.1788186616005493
"Informatics Tools for High-throughput Analysis of Cancer Mutations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large tumor exome sequencing projects have identified a very large number of mutations whose cancer relevance is not yet understood. To begin to address this need, our team has produced two web applications for high-throughput computational analysis of cancer mutations: the Cancer-Related Analysis of VAriants Toolkit (CRAVAT) and the Mutation Position Imaging Toolbox (MuPIT). CRAVAT accepts millions of mutations in a single batch upload and maps mutations from genomic coordinates to annotated transcripts and proteins. MuPIT currently accepts batch uploads of up to 2500 SNVs and maps from genomic coordinates onto X-ray crystal structures of proteins from Protein Data Bank (PDB). We propose to combine and harden CRAVAT and MuPIT into a single web application, in which we will substantially improve the tools, user interface, software infrastructure, integration with external data resources and tools used by the community, and support for protected data. The scope of all tools in the web application will be broadened to handle analysis of the full range of small-scale mutation consequence types found in cancer exomes.  CRAVAT analysis identifies mutations most likely to have deleterious impact on protein function and those that are most likely to confer a selective advantage to cancer cells (drivers), using classifiers developed by our team. Classifier scores are supplemented with annotations, including population allele frequencies, previous occurrence in tumor tissue types, and gene functional categories, enabling filtering (e.g. removing polymorphisms) and prioritization. Gene-level annotation and scoring, by aggregation of classifier scores from mutations in a cohort is also provided.  MuPIT maps mutations from genomic positions onto to protein structures and provides interactive viewing of mutations in the context of protein structure, and in relation to a variety of annotations. To enable prioritization of interesting mutations and genes, the application provides a preview describing each structure and all available annotations (e.g., binding sites, experimental mutagenesis results, polymorphic and disease- associated variants that have been previously documented). After selecting a PDB of interest, the user is led to an interactive visualization page. An enhanced Jmol applet displays all SNVs mapped onto the structure. Frequently, many SNVs in the input list can be mapped onto a single structure, revealing clustering patterns around key functional sites.  Based only on word-of-mouth, since the debut of the two applications in August 2012, CRAVAT has been utilized by 129 unique users from 39 countries, and it has analyzed 1,136 submitted jobs, totaling 27.9 million mutations. MuPIT has been utilized by 242 unique users from 25 countries, with 720 submitted jobs. (Source: Google Analytics). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work will harden and develop web applications for the cancer genomics community to interpret small-scale mutations in cancer exomes. They are designed to handle very large number of mutations and to provide analysis targeted at researchers who are not bioinformatics experts.

"Informatic Profiling of Clinically Relevant Mutation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our group focuses on genetic variants that disrupt molecular functions that cause human disease. In this renewal R01 application, we propose to begin the process of realizing our long-term goals, and to expand our original scope of research to include the challenge of understanding genetic disease mutations and polymorphisms that affect gene expression regulation in noncoding regions. Additionally, we have formed collaborations with genetic data managers and will apply these methods to aid in their research and identify new testable hypotheses. We will do this in three aims. First, we will integrate predictions of protein-disease associations with mutation predictions to develop a new quantitative model of genotype and phenotype. Second, we will integrate each of these together to develop a systems level, molecular function genome annotator with functionality to import into the genome databases.

"Informatics Tools for High-throughput Analysis of Cancer Mutations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large tumor exome sequencing projects have identified a very large number of mutations whose cancer relevance is not yet understood. To begin to address this need, our team has produced two web applications for high-throughput computational analysis of cancer mutations: the Cancer-Related Analysis of VAriants Toolkit (CRAVAT) and the Mutation Position Imaging Toolbox (MuPIT). CRAVAT accepts millions of mutations in a single batch upload and maps mutations from genomic coordinates to annotated transcripts and proteins. MuPIT currently accepts batch uploads of up to 2500 SNVs and maps from genomic coordinates onto X-ray crystal structures of proteins from Protein Data Bank (PDB). We propose to combine and harden CRAVAT and MuPIT into a single web application, in which we will substantially improve the tools, user interface, software infrastructure, integration with external data resources and tools used by the community, and support for protected data. The scope of all tools in the web application will be broadened to handle analysis of the full range of small-scale mutation consequence types found in cancer exomes.  CRAVAT analysis identifies mutations most likely to have deleterious impact on protein function and those that are most likely to confer a selective advantage to cancer cells (drivers), using classifiers developed by our team. Classifier scores are supplemented with annotations, including population allele frequencies, previous occurrence in tumor tissue types, and gene functional categories, enabling filtering (e.g. removing polymorphisms) and prioritization. Gene-level annotation and scoring, by aggregation of classifier scores from mutations in a cohort is also provided.  MuPIT maps mutations from genomic positions onto to protein structures and provides interactive viewing of mutations in the context of protein structure, and in relation to a variety of annotations. To enable prioritization of interesting mutations and genes, the application provides a preview describing each structure and all available annotations (e.g., binding sites, experimental mutagenesis results, polymorphic and disease- associated variants that have been previously documented). After selecting a PDB of interest, the user is led to an interactive visualization page. An enhanced Jmol applet displays all SNVs mapped onto the structure. Frequently, many SNVs in the input list can be mapped onto a single structure, revealing clustering patterns around key functional sites.  Based only on word-of-mouth, since the debut of the two applications in August 2012, CRAVAT has been utilized by 129 unique users from 39 countries, and it has analyzed 1,136 submitted jobs, totaling 27.9 million mutations.

"Informatic profiling of clinically relevant mutation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Informatic profiling of clinically relevant mutation      Many approaches have been developed to predict whether a mutation associated with a disease is actually causative. In contrast to other approaches to predicting deleterious mutations, our approach, called in silico functional profiling, starts with learning residue-specific protein function and then estimates when it is disrupted. This research will continue our efforts to characterize what the underlying molecular disruption a mutation is causing and thereby improve accuracy of these approaches. We will do this by building a database that links clinical observation with molecular phenotype and using this to develop bioinformatic models of mutation. This is particularly relevant to cancer, since many mutations in cancer are both poorly understood and simply associated with cancer. The hypothesis of this proposal is that computational methods that predict a specific residue function using protein sequence and structure can classify known disease-associated mutations based on their function better than existing computational methods, and less expensively than experimental assays. In short, we will describe each phenotypically annotated mutation as possibly affecting catalysis, protein interactions, posttranslational modification and stability of the protein. The structural environments around disease associated mutations can be characterized using a combination of computational biochemical methods based on first principles of biomolecular structure and function and statistical informatics methods. We will continue this research by implementing the following steps: First, we will build a database of how often mutations in cancer, pharmacogenetics, Mendelian and complex disease are disrupted by phosphorylation, stability, catalysis, protein interaction and other posttranslational modifications. Second, we will build a bioinformatic model of disruption using machine learning methods trained with these and other commonly used features. Finally, we will link these to clinical observation by annotating disease causing mutation with an ontology of diseases and integrate these predictions into databases of mutation.

"A Functional Census of p53 Cancer and Suppressor Mutants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The broad, long-term objectives are (1) demonstrate computational and experimental methods cooperating to achieve a functional census of a large mutation sequence space of great medical importance; (2) contribute to our knowledge of p53 functional rescue mechanisms, and so facilitate the search for a small molecule cancer drug that effects an analogous functional rescue of p53; and (3) elucidate part of the systems biology of cancer by characterizing the spectrum of p53 cancer and suppressor mutants across known downstream p53 DNA binding sites. Mutations to the tumor suppressor protein p53 occur in approximately half of all human cancers, and restoring function to a mutationally defective p53 protein is a long-held medical goal. Biological precedence for rescuing p53 cancer mutations is found in second-site p53 cancer suppressor mutations. The analogous p53 pharmacological rescue would save hundreds of thousands of lives annually. Understanding and predicting p53 rescue is an important step toward that goal.      The specific aims are (1) computationally predict all single suppressor mutations for p53 cancer mutants and validate the results experimentally, (2) optimize the rescue effects of known and putative p53 suppressor regions through two or more coordinated mutation changes, and (3) predict and experimentally validate the DNA binding specificity of p53 cancer and suppressor mutants for known p53 DNA binding sites. Our broad strategy is a coordinated computational and experimental attack. We already have experimental p53 functional assays and computational predictors of p53 activity, developed as part of our Preliminary Studies. Computational predictors will be used to focus experimental work into the highest priority areas. Experimental validation of the predictions will lead to a larger training set for machine learning techniques. The larger training set will lead to even more accurate predictions, thus even more focused experimentation. Thus, the interplay between computation and experiment will become ever more efficient as the project progresses. Variations of this basic strategy apply to each of our Specific Aims, which all rely on closely coordinated experiment and computation. n/a",A Functional Census of p53 Cancer and Suppressor Mutants,7613343,R01CA112560,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Apoptosis', 'Area', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancerous', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Cycle Arrest', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Consensus', 'DNA Binding', 'Data Sources', 'Engineering', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proliferating', 'Protein p53', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source Code', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Suppressor Mutations', 'Surveys', 'Systems Biology', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'functional restoration', 'interest', 'killings', 'mutant', 'programs', 'repaired', 'research study', 'small molecule', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'web site']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2009,342292,0.09786243138474014

"Informatic profiling of clinically relevant mutation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       We are submitting this proposal pursuant to NOT-0D-09-058, NIH Announces the Availability of Recovery Act Funds for Competitive Revision Applications.       Our group focuses on understanding how amino acid substitutions disrupt molecular functions that cause human disease. In our currently funded R01, we are developing methods we call in silico functional profiling. This method works by learning residue-specific protein function and then estimates when it is disrupted. This research funds our efforts to characterize what the underlying molecular disruption a protein mutation is causing and thereby improve accuracy of these approaches. In this competitive revision application, we are proposing to expand our efforts to the challenge of understanding genetic disease mutations and polymorphisms that affect gene expression regulation or transcript splicing. Additionally, we have formed collaborations with genetic data managers and will apply all of our methods to aid in their research and identify new testable hypotheses. We will do this in three supplemental aims. First, we will evaluate genomic features for prediction of regulatory nucleotide substitutions and construct new methods to aid in their classification. Second, we will collaboratively work to develop machine learning methods for classification of nucleotide substitutions that disrupt transcript splicing. Finally, we will work to collaboratively annotate genetic data found in inherited disease, pharmacogenetics and somatic mutations in cancer. Together this Recovery Act proposal will fund two groups in bioinformatics and will support trainees, technical staff, and two faculty members.           7. Narrative In this research, we will identify genetic variants that are likely to disrupt genome function, mRNA transcript processing and protein function.

"Modeling of Protein Complexes and Missense Mutations Amino acid mutations in human proteins are often associated with inherited predispositions to specific diseases. Yet most observed missense polymorphisms, those involving a single nucleotide change leading to a changed amino acid, have not been characterized in terms of their effects on protein structure and function. We hypothesize that many of the most deleterious missense mutations affect protein function in one of two ways: 1) by altering interaction of proteins with other molecules, including other proteins, DMA, and small ligands; or 2) by altering stability of the protein. Both of these mechanisms depend primarily on the location of the mutation and its physical properties: changes in protein interactions are usually caused by mutations in or very near to a binding site; changes in stability are usually caused by mutations of buried hydrophobic residues. The aim of this proposal is to develop a computational system for predicting the functional effects of missense mutations through homology modeling of protein complexes. New functional data on 1000 random mutations in two dimeric enzyme systems will be obtained to train and test the model. The primary application of this computational system will be to genes associated with the development of cancer. Cancer is usually linked to a number of genetic changes, some inherited and others somatic. These include loss of DNA-damage repair, breakdown of cell-cycle checkpoints, and resistance to apoptosis. Each of these processes requires many protein interactions, often in large protein complexes. These interactions may be compromised by missense mutations that alter individual interactions between molecules or mutations that lower protein stability. n/a",Modeling of Protein Complexes and Missense Mutations,7582317,R01GM073784,"['Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Apoptosis', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cancer Genome Anatomy Project', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoint', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cystathionine beta-Synthase', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Enzymes', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Goals', 'HIV Protease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Ions', 'Lac Repressors', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (NADPH)', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Muramidase', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Potential Energy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Side', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'base', 'dimer', 'graphical user interface', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'interest', 'loss of function', 'monomer', 'open source', 'physical property', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure function']",NIGMS,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R01,2009,307176,0.1152406343049741
"A Functional Census of p53 Cancer and Suppressor Mutants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The broad, long-term objectives are (1) demonstrate computational and experimental methods cooperating to achieve a functional census of a large mutation sequence space of great medical importance; (2) contribute to our knowledge of p53 functional rescue mechanisms, and so facilitate the search for a small molecule cancer drug that effects an analogous functional rescue of p53; and (3) elucidate part of the systems biology of cancer by characterizing the spectrum of p53 cancer and suppressor mutants across known downstream p53 DNA binding sites. Mutations to the tumor suppressor protein p53 occur in approximately half of all human cancers, and restoring function to a mutationally defective p53 protein is a long-held medical goal. Biological precedence for rescuing p53 cancer mutations is found in second-site p53 cancer suppressor mutations. The analogous p53 pharmacological rescue would save hundreds of thousands of lives annually. Understanding and predicting p53 rescue is an important step toward that goal.      The specific aims are (1) computationally predict all single suppressor mutations for p53 cancer mutants and validate the results experimentally, (2) optimize the rescue effects of known and putative p53 suppressor regions through two or more coordinated mutation changes, and (3) predict and experimentally validate the DNA binding specificity of p53 cancer and suppressor mutants for known p53 DNA binding sites. Our broad strategy is a coordinated computational and experimental attack. We already have experimental p53 functional assays and computational predictors of p53 activity, developed as part of our Preliminary Studies. Computational predictors will be used to focus experimental work into the highest priority areas. Experimental validation of the predictions will lead to a larger training set for machine learning techniques. The larger training set will lead to even more accurate predictions, thus even more focused experimentation. Thus, the interplay between computation and experiment will become ever more efficient as the project progresses. Variations of this basic strategy apply to each of our Specific Aims, which all rely on closely coordinated experiment and computation. n/a",A Functional Census of p53 Cancer and Suppressor Mutants,7426313,R01CA112560,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Apoptosis', 'Area', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancerous', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Cycle Arrest', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Consensus', 'DNA Binding', 'Data', 'Engineering', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Numbers', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proliferating', 'Protein p53', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source Code', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Suppressor Mutations', 'Surveys', 'Systems Biology', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'functional restoration', 'interest', 'killings', 'mutant', 'programs', 'repaired', 'research study', 'small molecule', 'transcription factor', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2008,335397,0.09786243138474014

"A Functional Census of p53 Cancer and Suppressor Mutants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The broad, long-term objectives are (1) demonstrate computational and experimental methods cooperating to achieve a functional census of a large mutation sequence space of great medical importance; (2) contribute to our knowledge of p53 functional rescue mechanisms, and so facilitate the search for a small molecule cancer drug that effects an analogous functional rescue of p53; and (3) elucidate part of the systems biology of cancer by characterizing the spectrum of p53 cancer and suppressor mutants across known downstream p53 DNA binding sites. Mutations to the tumor suppressor protein p53 occur in approximately half of all human cancers, and restoring function to a mutationally defective p53 protein is a long-held medical goal. Biological precedence for rescuing p53 cancer mutations is found in second-site p53 cancer suppressor mutations. The analogous p53 pharmacological rescue would save hundreds of thousands of lives annually. Understanding and predicting p53 rescue is an important step toward that goal.      The specific aims are (1) computationally predict all single suppressor mutations for p53 cancer mutants and validate the results experimentally, (2) optimize the rescue effects of known and putative p53 suppressor regions through two or more coordinated mutation changes, and (3) predict and experimentally validate the DNA binding specificity of p53 cancer and suppressor mutants for known p53 DNA binding sites. Our broad strategy is a coordinated computational and experimental attack. We already have experimental p53 functional assays and computational predictors of p53 activity, developed as part of our Preliminary Studies. Computational predictors will be used to focus experimental work into the highest priority areas. Experimental validation of the predictions will lead to a larger training set for machine learning techniques. The larger training set will lead to even more accurate predictions, thus even more focused experimentation. Thus, the interplay between computation and experiment will become ever more efficient as the project progresses.

"Text Mining Point Mutations for Genetic Diagnosis Array DESCRIPTION:    Text mining applications seek to alleviate the problems with identifying, searching, and extracting relevant information from large sets of literature. The goal of this proposal is to create a text mining application to extract protein point mutations from biomedical literature. The developed application will be used to extract point mutations from literature discussing human genetic disorders, and the retrieved database of point mutations used to design a DNA microarray chip for prenatal genetic diagnosis. First, the text mining application will be developed using machine learning and statistical natural language processing techniques. Second, the point mutation mining application will be applied to a large set of literature related to genetic disorders, and the retrieved point mutations deposited in an electronic database. This collection of point mutations will be examined to find polymorphisms in genes that are markers for genetic disorders. These polymorphic positions in the human genome will be gathered and used to design a DMA microarray chip that can genotype tens of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms. The microarray chip can be used for prenatal genetic diagnosis purposes to screen for hundreds of genetic disorders. n/a",Text Mining Point Mutations for Genetic Diagnosis Array,6993320,F37LM008883,"['biotechnology', 'information retrieval', 'microarray technology', 'molecular biology information system', 'point mutation', 'predoctoral investigator', 'technology /technique development']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO,F37,2005,45812,0.0883301986191109

"Genetic determinants of 4D genome folding in human cardiac development PROJECT SUMMARY A major unanswered question is how chromatin topology coordinates human development and cellular differentiation, and how genome folding is differentially regulated in human disease. It is thought that three- dimensional (3D) chromatin organization is driven by transcriptional regulators, but fundamental mechanisms of this regulation as it relates to disease-relevant human cells have not been well explored. We propose to elucidate the temporally dynamic 3D nucleome (4DN) that underlies human cardiac differentiation, its molecular underpinnings, and the impact of mutations that underly defective 4DN organization in human congenital heart disease (CHD). CHDs are the most common birth defect and arise from abnormal heart development. The genetic basis of CHD is largely mutations in genes encoding chromatin modifiers (e.g. WDR5, KMT2D) and transcription factors (TFs, e.g. TBX5, GATA4), many of which also cause adult-onset arrhythmias. The impact of CHD mutations on the 4DN has not been explored. We hypothesize that 3D genome folding is highly regulated during cardiac differentiation and is impacted by disease-causing mutations in transcriptional regulators and non-coding elements. We will use iPS cell models and machine learning to elucidate dynamic 3D chromatin organization in human cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells during normal and diseased cardiac differentiation. We propose 3 specific aims: Aim 1: Establish a kilobase-scale 4D map of genome folding in human cardiomyocytes (CM) and endothelial cell (EC) differentiation. We will use directed differentiation of human iPS cells towards the two major cell types of the developing heart: CMs and ECs, and using microC across a fine time course of differentiation we will define at kilobase scale the 3D organization of the genome, capturing the states of developmental intermediates and the final differentiated cells. This aim will generate an essential integrated 4DN template for discovery in cardiac differentiation. In Aim 2: we will Determine the regulatory and disease-related basis for cardiac 3D chromatin organization. We will perform microC in iPS cell lines with CHD-associated mutations in transcriptional regulators, differentiated into CMs and ECs. These findings will establish the degree to which CHD is caused by abnormal genome folding and chromatin states, with important relevance to other human cardiovascular diseases. Finally, Aim 3 will address High-throughput screening of millions of CHD and synthetic non- coding mutations with a deep-learning model of dynamic genome folding. We will build a deep-learning model predicting 3D chromatin contact frequencies across cardiac differentiation at kilobase-resolution. By introducing thousands of CHD patient deletions and other non-coding mutations in silico, we will prioritize variants likely to interact with transcriptional regulators to cause disease through disrupted genome folding. Several candidates will be validated in engineered iPS cells differentiated into CMs and ECs. These results will provide a novel platform for computational discovery of disease variant impact across diverse human diseases PROJECT NARRATIVE Congenital heart defects are present in 1-2 out of 100 births, and are caused by mutations in genes that may control the 3-dimensional organization of chromosomes. We will use human cellular models and Artificial Intelligence to understand how chromosome organization is controlled during heart development and altered by disease processes.

"The interaction of myosin and the thin filament: how mutations cause allosteric dysfunction and their connection to genetic cardiomyopathy Project Summary: The long-term goal of this research program is to develop a rigorously experimentally validated all-atom computational model of the cardiac thin filament (CTF) bound to myosin S1 which provides a unique and accessible platform to identify novel, high resolution disease mechanisms linked to Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM). In the prior funding period, we refined and extended our existing CTF computational model and successfully employed it to identify unique and clinically relevant allosteric disease mechanisms including HCM mutation-induced changes in myofilament Ca2+ kinetics, mutation-specific molecular causes of differential cardiac remodeling and disease progression. This included an in vivo validation via the development of a novel transgenic mouse model of cTnT-linked dilated cardiomyopathy and a predictive algorithm to determine the pathogenicity of cTnT mutations that out-performed existing computational approaches in a preliminary test. The key to these advances has been the ability of the current model to precisely identify and locate allosteric changes caused by mutations throughout all components of the CTF followed by closely coupled experimental validation and eventual in vivo model correlation. We now propose to significantly expand the biological complexity of the model to include myosin S1, the molecular motor that drives contraction and the second most common genetic cause of HCM. This important and challenging advance will facilitate a deeper understanding of disease pathogenesis by, for the first time, incorporating the role of molecular allosteric mechanisms between myosin S1 and thin filament. This new computational – experimental platform will be used for both mechanistic insight (for example used for the identification of novel myofilament disease targets,) and the development of a comprehensive deep-learning predictive algorithm to assign pathogenicity to both myosin and thin filament HCM mutations. The latter represents the first use of high-resolution structure, dynamics and function to predict HCM disease allele pathogenicity, a central challenge in the clinical management of these complex patients. Both the training and testing components of the deep learning development will utilize data from the highly annotated and curated SHaRe HCM registry thus greatly improving translational power. Two Specific Aims will be pursued: Aim 1 will utilize state of the art rare event simulation methods developed in one of our groups and refinement of existing unstructured domains of the CTF via FRET to establish the new model. Aim 2 will employ an extensive program of computational analysis and subsequent in vitro validation using pathogenic, variants of unknown significance and non- pathogenic HCM alleles derived from SHaRe to provide inputs to the machine learning environment for algorithm development. Novel disease mechanisms for myosin and thin filament HCM that include crosstalk between the two components will also be explored. Elucidation of these mechanisms can be the basis for robust molecular approaches to disease. Precision medicine and “molecular” medicine are concepts that aim to employ a patient’s genetic structure to discern the best medical treatments for disease. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a genetic disease that afflicts 1/500 people. This application translates our knowledge of the molecular level effects of cardiac tissue mutation to disease and will aim to lead to eventual treatment.",The interaction of myosin and the thin filament: how mutations cause allosteric dysfunction and their connection to genetic cardiomyopathy,10071638,R01HL107046,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Anisotropy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Breath Tests', 'C-terminal', 'Cardiac', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical Management', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Contracts', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Differential Scanning Calorimetry', 'Dilated Cardiomyopathy', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distant', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Fluorescence Anisotropy', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Structures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Induced Mutation', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microfilaments', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Medicine', 'Molecular Motors', 'Motor', 'Mutation', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sarcomeres', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick Filament', 'Thin Filament', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'cell motility', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'educational atmosphere', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'inherited cardiomyopathy', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'phosphorescence', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'quantum chemistry', 'response', 'simulation', 'stopped-flow fluorescence', 'success', 'variant of unknown significance']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2020,585711,0.07027674405975953
"Synergistic integration of topology and machine learning for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation impacts Project Summary The success of the ongoing battle with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) depends crucially on the availability of effective diagnostics, vaccines, antibody therapeutics, and small-molecular drugs. Although SARS-CoV-2 mutates slower than the viruses that cause the flu and the common cold, it has had more than 8300 observed single mutations on its genome of 29,900 nucleotides by June 1, 2020. We show that these mutations might have devastating effects on COVID-19 diagnostics, vaccines, antibody therapeutics, and small-molecular drugs (J. Chem. Inf. Model. In press). We will develop new artificial intelligence (AI) to forecast SARS-CoV-2 future mutations. Leveraging on state-of-art methods developed under the present R01 award, we will design mutation- resistant vaccines, antibody therapeutics, and small-molecular drugs. The CPUs and GPUs requested in this supplement will be essential for my lab to continue the research of the present R01 award and to apply the methods developed in this award to attack fundamental problems in combating COVID-19.

"Imaging signatures of genetic mutations in glioblastoma using machine learning Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common and aggressive malignant adult brain tumor, with grim prognosis and heterogeneous molecular and imaging profiles. Although the currently applicable treatment options (i.e., surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy) have expanded during the last 20 years, there is no substantial improvement in the OS rates. The major obstacle in treating GBM patients is the heterogeneity of their molecular landscape. Determination of molecular targets requires ex vivo postoperative tissue analyses, which are limited in assessing the tumor's spatial heterogeneity (sampling error due to single sample histopathological and molecular analysis) and temporal heterogeneity (not possible to continuously assess the molecular transformation of the tumor during treatment). Herein we propose to develop quantitative imaging phenomic (QIP) markers of a range of mutations of interest in GB. We will build on prior work on EGFR, IDH1 mutations and MGMT methylation QIP signatures, and develop an extensive panel of imaging signatures of 10 gene mutations, as well as MGMT promoter methylation, using machine learning methods applied to relatively routine clinical mpMRI (standard plus diffusion tensor and perfusion protocols). Availability of such biomarkers can contribute to non-invasive i) patient stratification into appropriate treatments, ii) measurement of individual molecular characteristics. In particular, we propose to carry out the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1 (SA1): To develop the enabling methodologies for constructing Quantitative Imaging Phenomic signatures of GB mutations Specific Aim 2 (SA2): Establish QIP signatures of 10 mutations of interest in gliomas, plus MGMT promoter status, using next generation sequencing (NGS). We will use 709 datasets. Specific Aim 3 (SA3): Characterize the molecular heterogeneity of GB using QIP signatures, leveraging the NGS samples of SA1, as well as a new sample that we will genotype, adding to a total of 600 tumor samples obtained from 4 different locations per patient from 150 patients. The first 150 tissue samples are already analyzed as part of ongoing work. Specific Aim 4 (SA4): Integrate our methods into the Cancer Imaging Phenomics Toolkit (CaPTk), in order to allow easy access to them by users This project will investigate the relationship between imaging characteristics of glioblastoma and its underlying genetic mutations/variants. As such, it aims to develop a number of imaging signatures of mutations that are important in GBM, using 1,159 (709 patients plus an additional 450 tissue samples of 150 of these patients obtained from different locations in the tumor) analyzed via next generation sequencing. The primary motivation of this work is to develop the imaging analytics methodologies and associated biomarkers that will allow us to evaluate the spatial, temporal and molecular heterogeneity of glioblastoma, thereby assisting in patient stratification and treatment.",Imaging signatures of genetic mutations in glioblastoma using machine learning,9893291,R01NS042645,"['Adult', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Ligand Binding', 'Location', 'MGMT gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Mutation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Phenotype', 'Postoperative Period', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiogenomics', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Errors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stratification', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'genetic signature', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'molecular imaging', 'next generation sequencing', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized predictions', 'phenomics', 'predictive signature', 'programs', 'promoter', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'rapid growth', 'receptor', 'routine imaging', 'standard of care', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,670422,0.04133954392930035
"The adaptive potential of translational regulation Project Summary/Abstract  Our current understanding of the adaptive effects of mutation is largely limited to alterations in protein coding sequence and disruption of transcriptional cis-regulatory promoters. Very little is known about how mutations alter translation, or the role these mutations play in adaptation and evolution. This project seeks to address this gap by identifying the functional effect of mutations on translation. To accomplish this I will first identify mutations that arise from adaptation to various nutrient limited environments. I will then use expression profiling (e.g. RNA-seq, ribosome profiling, and RATE-seq) to identify the effect these mutations have on translation, as well as other levels of gene expression. This will provide insight into the magnitude of effect mutations have on translation and their relative rate. Furthermore, to fully characterize the role synonymous mutations have on fitness I will be using a deep scanning synonymous mutation library. To understand the role tRNA abundance plays in the fitness effect of a given synonymous mutations, I will also be evaluating fitness within tRNA under- and over-expression backgrounds. Because of the closely coupled nature of translation rates and mRNA decay, I will also characterize the effect synonymous mutations have on mRNA decay using RATE-seq. My analysis of the functional effects of these mutations on gene expression, particularly within the genetic background and environment in which they arose, will allow for the development of a machine learning algorithm that can use sequence and annotation features to predict the effect of a mutation on gene expression. This tool will aid future research into the effect mutations have of gene expression by allowing the identification of high-confidence candidates for further evaluation.  This project will be conducted at New York University’s Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, whose mission is to answer otherwise intractable biological questions using applied experimental and computational approaches. The Center houses numerous facilities and cores that will be instrumental in the performance of this work. The collaborative atmosphere and multi-disciplinary nature of NYU’s research communities that will enable me to stay abreast of developments in related fields and to rapidly communicate my research to interested parties. I will be trained under the guidance of Dr. David Gresham, an excellent researcher working on complementing long-term evolution experiments with gene expression studies to characterize the adaptive potential of the regulation of gene expression. Project Narrative The translation of mRNA into protein is a critical step in gene expression that is tightly regulated with mis-regulation of translation being a hallmark of many human pathologies. Understanding how mutations can alter the regulation of translation is an understudied but important aspect of adaptation and evolution. Ultimately, without an understanding of the adaptive potential of translation we have an incomplete, and imperfect, picture of the underlying genetic causes of numerous forms of cancer and genetic diseases.",The adaptive potential of translational regulation,9893712,F32GM131573,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Expression Profiling', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human Pathology', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'New York', 'Nutrient', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Pathology', 'Performance at work', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transfer RNA', 'Translation Initiation', 'Translational Regulation', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'cancer genetics', 'collaborative environment', 'driver mutation', 'environmental change', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genome sequencing', 'insight', 'interest', 'mRNA Decay', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'mutation screening', 'novel', 'preservation', 'promoter', 'response', 'ribosome profiling', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,65310,0.11588785697412439
"The Evolution of Gene Regulation and Human Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Genetic variants that disrupt the functionality of regulatory sequences, and thereby alter gene expression levels, are major contributors to both evolutionary divergence between species and differences in risk for complex disease among humans. However, due to the complexity of the gene regulatory programs encoded in mammalian genomes and their rapid turnover between species, evaluating the function of non-protein-coding mutations is challenging. This is a major roadblock to tracing the evolution of human-specific biology. In addition, since the majority of disease-associated variants are non-coding, it impairs our ability to map the genetics of complex disease.  The long-term mission of my lab is to interpret the complex gene regulatory programs encoded in the human genome and accurately model the effects of genetic mutations to these elements on phenotypes relevant to disease and human evolution. We work toward these goals by integrating cutting-edge machine learning, statistical modeling of evolution, and the analysis of genotypes and phenotypes from large-scale clinical biobanks. In particular, my lab is uniquely well positioned to build on our previous work to address the following fundamental questions:  1. How have evolutionary transitions on the human-lineage modified the genome—in particular gene  regulatory programs—to produce human-specific biology? And how do these modifications relate to  human-specific disease risk?  2. What are the combinatorial rules underlying how TF binding patterns specify precise control of gene  regulation? And how do these gene regulatory “programs” evolve between species?  3. How do genetic and epigenetic mechanisms interact to specify the dynamic gene regulatory programs  that drive cellular development? And how are these programs perturbed in disease?  4. How can we interpret non-protein-coding mutations identified in patient genomes to inform treatment  and preventative care? Our work will produce much-needed methods for understanding the effects of mutations to gene regulatory regions and identify mutations responsible for differences in disease risk between human populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The genetic mutations that distinguish humans from other great apes and that influence risk for complex disease are mostly found outside of genes. Many of these mutations influence when and where genes are expressed. However, we do not know how to interpret the effects of most such mutations on gene regulation, disease risk, or human evolution, we will develop computational models that leverage machine learning, evolutionary patterns, and large-scale clinical biobanks to identify mutations that disrupt proper control of genes and lead to disease.",The Evolution of Gene Regulation and Human Disease,9904747,R35GM127087,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Impairment', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pongidae', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive care', 'Regulator Genes', 'Risk', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Models', 'To specify', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biobank', 'cellular development', 'combinatorial', 'disorder risk', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'mammalian genome', 'programs', 'species difference']",NIGMS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R35,2020,86356,0.08132676794896912
"Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations Project Summary Although a quickly expanding catalogue of protein mutations have been discovered, including those that cause human diseases or confer drug resistance, mechanistic understanding and prediction of functional consequences of these mutations remain rather limited. There is a critical need to develop novel, multiscale computational frameworks that are rigorous and generalizable to help close the ever-increasing gap between phenotypic data and mechanistic knowledge about the mutations and to develop effective therapeutic strategies.  My long-term research goals are two folds: (1) to unravel how a change in protein sequence ripples through various aspects of molecular and system-levels to a change in cellular function and cause human diseases or confer drug resistance; and (2) to translate learned mechanistic knowledge to effective drug-design strategies for human diseases and drug resistance. Toward these goals I propose to advance and combine the strengths of computational molecular biology (structural modeling and design for proteins or protein interactions) and computational systems biology (pathway/network-level topology and dynamics) and follow a novel, formal paradigm to develop methods that systematically identify mechanisms underlying various stages of consequence propagation (from conformation, molecular and system-level variables, to cellular functions, where intermediates can be skipped if necessary). In the forward direction of propagating consequences, I will determine, explain and understand mutational consequences at various levels with machine learning, causal analysis, and combinatorial optimization, starting with known or modelled changes at various levels. In the inverse direction of designing consequences, I will follow known or learned mechanistic hypotheses and develop efficient combinatorial optimization methods to design mutagenesis experiments or screen / design ligands for desired perturbations at various levels, which would test and refine corresponding hypotheses directly and translate mechanistic hypotheses to therapeutic strategies. Mechanisms underlying distal (potentially allosteric) mutations, multiple mutations within a protein or across proteins as well as systems pharmacology strategies will also be rigorously determined in the process.  The expected outcomes from the innovative project will include two main components. The first will be both biophysical principles of proteins and integrative understanding of biomedical systems, which will be organized in a database for public access. The second will be translating mechanistic insights into therapeutic intervention strategies to treat diseases. In particular, targeted experiments (mutagenesis or ligand-binding) will be designed following known or discovered mechanistic hypotheses. This project will involve close collaboration with structural biologists and clinician-scientists who are active collaborators of the PI. Project Narrative Genetic mutations, many of which lead to protein mutations, are often associated with human diseases: they often directly cause diseases or contribute to their progressions.

"Physics-based precision medicine: computationally phenotyping myosin isoforms and cardiomyopathy mutations PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Myosins are a diverse and ubiquitous class of molecular motors that are responsible for generating much of the macroscopic force in the human body. The human genome encodes 38 different isoforms of myosin, and members of this group act as force sensors or generators for a diverse set of processes throughout the body. To serve this wide array of functions, each myosin isoform has been biophysically tuned for its physiological role. In fact, the tuning is so precise that missense variants in one myosin isoform, !-cardiac myosin, can cause a congenital cardiomyopathy that is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in people under 30. And yet, it is unknown how particular variants cause disease, or how to infer the pathogenic potential for novel mutations.  Large differences in functional properties between myosin isoforms are not the result of large differences in coding sequence or overall topology. Neither foreknowledge of phylogeny nor crystal structure is sufﬁcient to predict an isoform's biophysical properties. Furthermore, mutations causing disease frequently occur in regions of the protein far from the site of their deleterious effects. Poor understanding of the biophysical regulation of motor function has hampered the development of pharmaceuticals and the interpretation of human genomic data.  My goal is to establish a mechanistic understanding of myosin motors that is capable of predicting if and how sequence variation changes biophysical properties and can cause cardiac disease. Since myosin kinetics are not apparent from sequence or overall structure, they must be determined by other factors. I hypothesize that kinetic differences result from differences in the allosteric networks in these proteins. Allosteric network in this context refers to the coordinated conformational ﬂuctuations that give protein regulation the appearance of action at a distance. To test this hypothesis, we will use our unique combination of enormous computational power for molecular simulation and cutting-edge machine learning tools for analyzing protein allostery.  Aim 1 is to identify the biophysical determinants of myosin isoforms' differing speeds. To test our hypothesis that allosteric networks are responsible for modulating dynamics, I will use molecular simulations of different myosin isoforms and compare their allosteric networks with biochemical data about their properties. Aim 1 directly addresses outstanding questions about normal molecular-biological function of the heart, putting it in line with NHLBI overarching objective #1.  Aim 2 is to determine the difference, at atomic resolution, between healthy and diseased !-cardiac myosin. I hypothesize that the pathogenicity of variants with an unknown molecular etiology is a consequence of allosteric disruption, and will use our computational tools to test this hypothesis by simulating a set of known-pathogenic variants. This aim uses techniques from data science to understand the genetic determinants of health, and will apply equally well to rare alleles in under-represented groups as to majority groups. It is directly addresses NHLBI overarching objectives #3, #4, and #7. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Myosins are a closely-related group of molecules that are responsible for generating much of the force in the human body, including the heartbeat, the movement of limbs, and driving food through the stomach and intestines. Small changes to the myosin genes can have large effects: in healthy people, these give rise to different myosins that perform different functions, and mutations in some myosin genes can give rise to diseases that cause of sudden cardiac death. This proposal aims to learn, at the level of atoms and interatomic bonds, why and how these subtle changes to the myosin gene can create such large effects in the protein's function.",Physics-based precision medicine: computationally phenotyping myosin isoforms and cardiomyopathy mutations,9881184,F30HL146052,"['Actins', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Appearance', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Process', 'Biophysics', 'Cardiac Myosins', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Catalysis', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Congenital cardiomyopathy', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Binding Site', 'Etiology', 'Food', 'Genes', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Human body', 'Intestines', 'Kinetics', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Motors', 'Motor', 'Mutation', 'Myosin ATPase', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient risk', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Region', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Relaxation', 'Resolution', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solvents', 'Speed', 'Stomach', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Variant', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'computerized tools', 'disease-causing mutation', 'force sensor', 'genomic data', 'heart function', 'improved', 'insight', 'limb movement', 'member', 'millisecond', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'protein function', 'prototype', 'rare variant', 'rat Ran 2 protein', 'simulation', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,48719,0.06855476954782885
"Predicting Transcriptional and Epigenetic Networks in Cancer from Sequencing Data Limitless replicative potential is a key hallmark of cancer and critically depends on telomere maintenance. Many cancers thus aberrantly reactivate the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), a catalytic subunit of the telomerase complex that elongates telomere. It has been recently discovered that this common path to immortality in multiple cancers is through two activating point mutations in the TERT promoter (TERTp), found in more than 50 different cancer types, often at strikingly high frequencies, e.g. roughly 83% in glioblastomas (GBM) and 71% in melanomas. In the previous funding period, the PI has identified the molecular function of these highly recurrent mutations, demonstrating that the transcription factor (TF) GABP binds the mutant TERTp with exquisite specificity, but not the wild-type TERTp. The high prevalence of TERTp mutations across multiple cancer types and the selectivity of GABP recruitment to mutant TERTp thus provide an unprecedented opportunity for treating a large number of cancer patients with minimal toxicity to healthy cells. Despite the clear significance of this opportunity, however, several important questions surrounding the molecular functions and modulators of TERTp mutations remain poorly understood, hindering the development of effective and safe therapeutic strategies.  Our long-term goal is to establish a rigorous computational framework for understanding the aberrant transcriptional and epigenetic networks in cancers and to apply the resulting knowledge to devise novel therapeutic strategies that account for the genetic background of individual patients and that can a priori predict and avoid potential resistance mechanisms. The objective of our current renewal proposal is to develop powerful computational methods for transforming our knowledge about the non-coding TERTp mutations into an effective and safe molecular target. At the same time, the resulting methods will help resolve several outstanding challenges in the field of transcriptional gene regulation and have broad applications in cancer genomics. We will accomplish our objective my pursuing the following Aims: (1) Develop and test a computational framework for inferring sequence features that determine the distinct and shared binding patterns of paralogous TFs; (2) Develop and validate integrative tools for discovering the molecular basis of genetic interactions between germline variations and oncogenic mutations; (3) Develop and apply computational methods for studying the role of DNA helical phase between adjacent binding motifs in recruiting ETS factors to chromatin; (4) Perform a systematic genomic characterization of the effects of knocking out GABPB1L in TERTp-mutant cancer cells and healthy cells. The results of this proposal will have a broad impact on cancer research by providing powerful tools for studying paralogous oncogenic TFs and revealing novel insights into a highly promising therapeutic strategy. The proposed research will provide computational and bioinformatic resources for studying the binding pattern of paralogous oncogenic transcription factors. It will provide a computational framework for inferring the function of non-coding regulatory mutations and studying their interaction with common genetic variants. As an important application, we will systematically analyze a novel therapeutic strategy that has the potential to treat effectively a large number of patients across multiple cancer types harboring the recently discovered TERT promoter mutations.",Predicting Transcriptional and Epigenetic Networks in Cancer from Sequencing Data,9831048,R01CA163336,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug resistance', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specificity', 'TERT gene', 'Techniques', 'Telomerase', 'Telomere Maintenance', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bioinformatics resource', 'c-myc Genes', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer type', 'computer framework', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'dimer', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'knowledge of results', 'melanoma', 'member', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'resistance mechanism', 'telomere', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'treatment response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2020,326848,0.11864351204174775
"ADPKD: Disease Spectrum & Genotype-Phenotype Correlations Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common monoallelic disorder associated with progressive cyst development and resulting in end stage renal failure (ESRD) in 50% of patients by 60y. However, there is considerable phenotypic variability, extending from in utero onset to patients with adequate renal function into old age. Autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD), as traditionally defined, results in PLD with minimal renal cysts. Classically there have been considered two ADPKD genes, PKD1 and PKD2, encoding PC1 and PC2, and two ADPLD genes, PRKCSH and SEC63, but in the past few years greater genetic heterogeneity has been described, with nine genes now implicated overall. Recent data also indicates an overlap in etiology and pathogenesis associated with ADPKD and ADPLD, with the efficient biogenesis and localization of the PC-complex central to both disorders. During the last funding period we identified a novel gene, GANAB, which is associated with both disorders, where the encoded protein, GII is involved in the maturation and trafficking of PC1.  In this proposal we will take advantage of advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) methodologies, and large populations of ADPKD and ADPLD patients that have been assembled and screened for the classic genes, to hunt for novel genes for these disorders (Aim 1). The phenotype associated with these genes will be characterized (Aim 3) along with their mechanism of action (Aim 2). NGS methods will be perfected to screen the segmentally duplicated locus, PKD1, and to identify missed mutations at the known loci, including those present in just some cells due to mosaicism (Aim 1). The significance of many PKD1 nontruncating variants has been difficult to evaluate (classed as variants of unknown significance; VUS), but recently evidence that some are incompletely penetrant alleles partially explains phenotypic variability in PKD1 populations. In Aim 2 improved in silico predictions, in combination with machine learning, will improve the understanding of the pathogenicity and penetrance of VUS. A cellular assay of the biogenesis and trafficking of this PC-complex will also be employed to quantify the penetrance of VUS. The mechanism of pathogenesis will be explored in animal models with ultralow penetrant (ULP) Pkd1 or Pkd2 alleles. Employing the large clinically, imaging, and genetically well-defined populations phenotypic groupings of patients will be defined that will then be compared to the genic and PKD1 allelic groups (Aim 3). This iterative process will allow the Variant Score (VS) associated with each PKD1 VUS to be refined. In a separate population the revised VS, alone and in combination with clinical, functional, and imaging data, will be employed to generate a comprehensive, predictive algorithm for ADPKD (Aim 3). Disease modifiers to severe disease, via biallelic ADPKD, and due to alleles at other loci will also be identified and characterized in the cellular assay and in vivo in combination with the Pkd1 hypomorphic, RC model. The final aim will exploit the newly identified information that some PKD1 and PKD2 VUS are rescuable, folding mutations that in a maturation-fostering environment can traffic and function appropriately. A screening scheme based on the level of cell surface PC1 will be improved and new chaperone drugs specific for the PC complex will be sought in collaboration with Sanford Burnham Prebys. A second mutation group that will be explored therapeutically are nonsense mutations. A cellular assay for readthrough efficiency is being developed and will be used for screening. Identified chaperone or readthrough drugs will be tested in available mouse models. Overall this proposal will better explain the etiology and the genetic causes of phenotypic variability in ADPKD/ADPLD, develop better prognostic tools for individual selection of patients for treatment that are now becoming available, and explore allele based treatments for ADPKD. ADPKD and ADPLD are genetic diseases associated with cyst development and loss of function in the kidney and liver cysts, where the disease severity varies greatly between patients. Here we will identify new genes that cause these disorders and evaluate mutations in silico, in a cellular assay, and in whole animals to better predict the disease course in each patient.

"Computational approaches for identifying epigenomic contexts of somatic mutations ABSTRACT During normal development, aging, and diseases such as cancer, DNA damage due to endogenous and external factors, and repair defects result in accumulation of different types of somatic mutations including single nucleotide substitutions, small InDels, copy number alterations, translocations, and ploidy changes. While a vast majority of somatic mutations in the genome are not disease drivers, their patterns of genetic changes and associated context can provide insights into past exposure to mutagens, mechanisms of DNA damage and repair defects, and extent of genomic instability, which are important for understanding disease etiology, minimizing hazardous environmental exposure, and also predicting efficacy of emerging treatment strategies such as immunotherapy. A number of mutation signatures have been identified based on local sequence contexts to address this need. But, mechanisms of DNA damage and repair preferences depend on both local sequence and epigenomic contexts, and it remains to be understood whether epigenomic contexts of emerging mutation signatures can provide critical, complementary etiological insights at a genome-wide scale, which are not apparent from sequence contexts alone. This is of fundamental importance, because (i) etiology of many of the emerging mutation signatures is currently unknown, (ii) DNA damage response and repair depends on tissue contexts, and defects in core DNA repair genes often result in cancer development in tissue-specific manner, and (iii) differences in the extent of DNA damage and repair between stem and differentiated cells within the same tissues have consequences for aging and disease incidence rates. Built logically on our previous works, we propose to develop computational approaches to determine the impact of epigenomic contexts on the patterns of somatic mutations within and across tissue types, and validate computational predictions using targeted experiments. In Aim-1, we will develop an epigenomic context preference map for emerging mutation signatures. In Aim-2, we will determine the basis of tissue-dependent differences in mutation profiles attributed to DNA repair defects. In Aim-3, we will predict the extent of cell lineage-dependent patterns of mutation accumulation from the mutational landscape of terminal cells. I am currently an early stage investigator, and the proposal is aligned with my long-term goal to identify fundamental principles of mutability and evolvability of somatic genomes. Our project will deliver novel resources and knowledge for addressing questions regarding genomic integrity during development and aging, and diseases such as cancer. ! PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will use computational biology approaches to determine epigenomic context preference for somatic mutations, and use that to infer tissue-dependent changes in mutation patterns. Our results will provide fundamental insights into aspects of genome maintenance, which is important for advancing our understanding of cancer etiology, reducing exposure to mutagenic factors, and also predicting efficacy of emerging treatment strategies. !",Computational approaches for identifying epigenomic contexts of somatic mutations,9902467,R01GM129066,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Relapse', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Gene', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Location', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutagens', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Ploidies', 'Point Mutation', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer genomics', 'computer framework', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome integrity', 'genome-wide', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'markov model', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'repaired', 'response', 'stem', 'stem cells', 'tissue stem cells', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,RBHS -CANCER INSTITUTE OF NEW JERSEY,R01,2020,324350,0.06308118980769599
"Functional Annotation of Natural and Disease Variants in Tryosine Kinases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein tyrosine kinases are dynamic molecular switches that toggle between a catalytically ""on"" and ""off"" state to turn on and off signals responsible for cell growth and survival. While the tyrosine kinase switch is tightly regulated by  diverse array of structural mechanisms in normal states, in many disease states, the switch is permanently turned on or off due, in part, to mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain. Although genome sequencing studies have revealed the mutational patterns of tyrosine kinases from many different disease types, understanding the structural and functional impact of these mutations is a challenge because many recurrent mutations occur far from the active site (distal mutations) and the residue networks that contribute to the complex modes of tyrosine kinase allosteric regulation are not fully understood. Our long term goal is to understand the relationships connecting sequence, structure, function, regulation and disease in protein kinases using a combination of computational and experimental approaches. Our objective in this proposal, which is the next logical step toward attainment of our long-term goal, is to delineate the residue interaction networks that contribute to the unique modes of allosteric regulation in tyrosine kinases, and to develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact using the evolutionary and allosteric properties encoded in three dimensional structures. The central hypothesis is that distal mutations alter evolutionarily conserved allosteric networks in tyrosine kinases, and delineating the allosteric networks unique to tyrosine kinases will provide context for predicting and testing disease mutation impact. The specific aims are: * To identify and characterize natural sequence and structural variants associated with tight  allosteric control of tyrosine kinase activity * To develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact on kinase activation and to  experimentally validate computational predictions using selected receptor tyrosine kinases as  model systems Successful completion of these aims is expected to reveal novel activating mutations in putative allosteric sites in the tyrosine kinase domain, and pinpoint key residues and interactions for functional studies. These outcomes, in turn, are expected to have major biomedical impact by accelerating the functional characterization of the mutated tyrosine kinome, which is emerging as a major target for personalized medicine. Finally, by providing detailed mechanistic annotation of mutations identified in genome sequencing studies, this proposal will address a fundamental NIH roadmap problem in translational medicine of converting genomic discoveries into therapeutic strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein tyrosine kinases are a biomedically important class of proteins that are abnormally regulated in many human diseases including cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory disorders, to name but a few. They have been the focus of many drug discovery efforts and genome sequencing studies because of the therapeutic potential of targeting mutated tyrosine kinases for personalized therapy. By providing functional annotation of natural and disease mutations in tyrosine kinases, the proposed studies will accelerate the targeting of mutated tyrosine kinases for drug discovery and personalized therapy.",Functional Annotation of Natural and Disease Variants in Tryosine Kinases,10145865,R01GM114409,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Allosteric Regulation', 'Allosteric Site', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cell Survival', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Binding Site', 'Drug resistance', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammatory', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Property', 'Protein Kinase', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tyrosine', 'Tyrosine Kinase Domain', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell growth', 'computer framework', 'drug discovery', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning classifier', 'molecular dynamics', 'mutant', 'nonsynonymous mutation', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive test', 'public health relevance', 'three dimensional structure', 'translational medicine']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2020,9815,0.1788186616005493
"A statistical framework to systematically characterize cancer driver mutations in noncoding genomic regions PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer genomes typically harbor a substantial number of somatic mutations. Relatively few driver mutations actually alter the function of proteins in tumor cells, whereas most mutations are considered to be functionally neutral passenger mutations. Over the past decade, the search for cancer driver mutations has focused on coding regions and several mutational significance algorithms have been developed for coding mutations. The contribution of mutations in noncoding regulatory regions to tumor formation largely remains unknown and current mutational significance algorithms are not designed to detect driver mutations in noncoding regions, due to biological differences between coding and noncoding mutations. The emerging availability of large whole- genome sequencing datasets (e.g. PCAWG and HMF datasets) creates an ample opportunity to develop new mutational significance algorithms that are particularly designed for the interpretation of noncoding regions. Recently, we have developed a new statistical approach that identifies driver mutations in coding regions based on the nucleotide context. Critically, consideration of the nucleotide context around mutations does not require prior knowledge for functional consequences associated with these mutations. Hence, we hypothesize that generalizing our nucleotide context model to noncoding regions will uncover novel noncoding driver mutations that cannot be detected using the mutational significance approaches currently available. For this purpose, we will develop a statistical framework that incorporates the biological differences between coding and noncoding mutations and that is specifically designed to detect driver mutations in noncoding regions. Specifically, we will consider the context-dependent distribution of passenger mutations, modeling of the background mutation rate, accurately partition the background mutation rate, model the sequence composition of the reference genome, and account for coverage fluctuation. We will then combine these statistical components by computing an independent product of their underlying probabilities. We will derive a significance p-value using a Monte-Carlo simulation approach, and use FDR for multiple hypothesis test correction. This strategy will allow us to accurately estimate the significance of somatic mutations in noncoding genomic regions. We will next apply this statistical framework to whole-genome sequencing data of 5,523 tumor patients, thereby deriving a comprehensive list of candidate driver mutations in noncoding regions. Finally, we will investigate whether noncoding mutations are overrepresented in transcription factor binding sites, regulate gene expression levels, induce alternative splicing, or affect epigenomic states. Upon the completion of this project, we will have developed and applied a statistical framework for discovery of significant somatic mutations in noncoding regions, and defined the mutational landscape of the non-coding cancer genome. All aspects of the methods developed and applied in this project will be made open source and developed in an online platform. PROJECT NARRATIVE While coding cancer driver mutations have been characterized in detail over the past decade, the contribution of noncoding mutations to tumor formation remains - apart from few examples (e.g. mutations in TERT promoters) - largely unknown. Recently, large-scale whole-genome sequencing datasets have been made available, but a major bottleneck for the biological and clinical interpretation of these cancer whole-genome cohorts is the lack of statistical models that identify driver mutations in noncoding regions. We developed a new statistical approach that characterizes driver mutations based on their surrounding nucleotide context in coding regions, and herein we propose a concrete plan to generalize our computational model to noncoding regions, apply our model to aggregated whole-genome sequencing data of 5,523 tumor patients (PCAWG, HMF datasets), and define the noncoding driver and passenger mutational landscape for biological discovery and focused clinical application.",A statistical framework to systematically characterize cancer driver mutations in noncoding genomic regions,10260680,R21CA242861,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Attention', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genomic Segment', 'Immunotherapy', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Untranslated RNA', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'checkpoint therapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical effect', 'cohort', 'design', 'driver mutation', 'epigenomics', 'exome sequencing', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immunogenicity', 'large datasets', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'open source', 'predicting response', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'reference genome', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'whole genome']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R21,2020,177000,0.21332848128658147
"Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes Project Summary Over the last two decades, significant experimental efforts have determined large sets of “reference” interactions for humans and other model organisms, along with substantial knowledge about the binding specificities of proteins, including for a large fraction of human transcription factors (TFs). The resulting data have proven to be an incredibly useful resource for understanding how cells function; nevertheless, they do not capture how molecular interactions and networks are different from the reference across individuals. Indeed, while human genomes in both healthy and disease populations are rapidly being sequenced, the corresponding individual-specific interaction networks remain largely unexamined; this represents a major gap in our knowledge, as mutations that alter molecular interactions underlie a wide range of human diseases. Further, the substantial amount of genetic variation across populations makes it infeasible in the near term to experimentally determine per-individual interaction networks. Thus our long-term goal is to develop computational methods to uncover whether and how mutations within coding and non-coding portions of the genome perturb cellular interactions and networks. Our specific aims are: (1) We will develop computational structure-based approaches to identify and catalog, at proteome-scale, variations within proteins that are likely to impact their ability to bind with DNA, RNA, small molecules, peptides or ions, thereby providing a comprehensive resource for analyzing protein interaction variation. (2) We will develop novel structure-based and probabilistic methods to predict how DNA-binding specificities are altered when a TF is mutated; since mutated TFs have been linked to numerous diseases, this will be a great aid in understanding disease networks and pathology. (3) We will develop new methods to uncover non-coding somatic mutations that alter human regulatory networks in cancer; this is a critical step towards ultimately uncovering patient-specific cancer networks. Overall by pursuing these aims—which integrate mutational information with existing knowledge about reference interactions, interfaces and specificities—we will develop novel computational methods that will significantly advance our understanding of molecular interactions perturbed in disease and healthy contexts. Narrative The proposed research will yield new software tools that predict whether specific genetic mutations alter molecular interactions and networks. Since many human diseases are caused by mutations that affect molecular interactions, this research will expand our understanding of the underlying basis of disease and will provide new avenues for diagnosis and treatment.",Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes,9896829,R01GM076275,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Organism', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'preference', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,312660,0.10308923770568891

We will next apply this statistical framework to whole-genome sequencing data of 5,523 tumor patients, thereby deriving a comprehensive list of candidate driver mutations in noncoding regions. Finally, we will investigate whether noncoding mutations are overrepresented in transcription factor binding sites, regulate gene expression levels, induce alternative splicing, or affect epigenomic states. Upon the completion of this project, we will have developed and applied a statistical framework for discovery of significant somatic mutations in noncoding regions, and defined the mutational landscape of the non-coding cancer genome. All aspects of the methods developed and applied in this project will be made open source and developed in an online platform. PROJECT NARRATIVE While coding cancer driver mutations have been characterized in detail over the past decade, the contribution of noncoding mutations to tumor formation remains - apart from few examples (e.g. mutations in TERT promoters) - largely unknown. Recently, large-scale whole-genome sequencing datasets have been made available, but a major bottleneck for the biological and clinical interpretation of these cancer whole-genome cohorts is the lack of statistical models that identify driver mutations in noncoding regions. We developed a new statistical approach that characterizes driver mutations based on their surrounding nucleotide context in coding regions, and herein we propose a concrete plan to generalize our computational model to noncoding regions, apply our model to aggregated whole-genome sequencing data of 5,523 tumor patients (PCAWG, HMF datasets), and define the noncoding driver and passenger mutational landscape for biological discovery and focused clinical application.",A statistical framework to systematically characterize cancer driver mutations in noncoding genomic regions,9957082,R21CA242861,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Attention', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genomic Segment', 'Immunotherapy', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Untranslated RNA', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'checkpoint therapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical effect', 'cohort', 'design', 'driver mutation', 'epigenomics', 'exome sequencing', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immunogenicity', 'large datasets', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'open source', 'predicting response', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'reference genome', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'whole genome']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R21,2020,193576,0.21332848128658147
"A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions Project summary There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how mutations are preferentially targeted to the variable (V) regions of the Immunoglobulin (Ig) loci during somatic hypermutation (SHM). The persistence of this gap has limited our understanding of the mutagenic mechanisms involving activation-induced deaminase (AID) in the immune response and in the role of AID in mis-targeting mutations leading to B-cell lymphomas and other cancers. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand the global targeting of mutations in immunity that are required to protect us from infections. As high-throughput data from human antibody immune responses became available, it provided us with new opportunities to generate hypotheses to explain the underlying mechanisms of SHM. We now propose to generate further hypotheses using computational models applied to additional databases and to validate these hypotheses using cellular and animal experiments. Our objective is to understand what directs SHM across the many human Ig heavy chain V-regions. Our central hypothesis is that the V-region SHM process is highly dependent on a DNA sequence signature(s) that drives mutations in a largely deterministic fashion. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary results using human in vivo data from a few human V region genes and has begun to be validated using independent databases and experiments in human B cell lines. The rationale is that evaluations of computational data based upon biological mechanisms, together with appropriate biological experiments, will reveal the key differences between IGHV regions (IGHV 3-23, 4-34, 1-18, 1-02, etc.) that lead to the dominance of each of those V regions in the responses to medically important antigens. Our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) identify the extent to which a DNA signature determines the mutation process in four individual human IGHV genes that are important in disease responses; 2) examine the relationship between AID hotspots and Polη hotspots across all the other human V region genes, thus rigorously defining a mutation targeting signature. Both aims will also entail studying human V region genes and modifications of them in human cell lines and in mice expressing a human V region to further confirm the signature and identify molecular mechanisms in vivo. Our approach is innovative because the computational models we are proposing will be mechanistically motivated focusing on the interaction between AID and Polη hotspots, thus testing molecular mechanisms as opposed to classic statistical models using whole V region sequences that ignore the underlying biology. In addition, to focus on mechanisms we will leverage new high-throughput data from human V regions that have not undergone antigen selection. Our results will be highly relevant to human IgV repertoire analyses from immune responses that are currently hard to interpret and will help future vaccine and therapeutic antibody development, as well as help to understand mutations in human malignancies where AID plays a key role. Project narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the targeting of AID-mediated mutations across many human heavy chain V-regions will make it possible to develop vaccines that will lead more rapidly to better and more broadly protective antibodies to infectious agents and reveal the risk factors in the development of B-cell malignancies and gastric and other solid tumors where AID is implicated.",A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions,10090262,R01AI132507,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Experiments', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmunity', 'B lymphoid malignancy', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Gene-Modified', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Heavy-Chain Immunoglobulins', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Knock-in', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stomach', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'activation-induced cytidine deaminase', 'base', 'chromatin modification', 'density', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'human data', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'innovation', 'neutralizing antibody', 'recruit', 'repair enzyme', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'vaccine response']",NIAID,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,38074,0.12175547856311676

"Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome Project Summary Congenital ataxia presents in early childhood with non-progressive hypotonia, gross motor, fine motor and cognitive delays. These disorders are distinct from the progressive ataxias because of the presence of congenital cerebellar malformations and because they are typically inherited recessively. Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) constitute a major subset of these conditions, consisting of a cerebellar midline (vermis) malformation, a nearly pathognomonic Molar Tooth sign on brain Imaging (MTI) and co-existent oculomotor apraxia and episodic breathing dysrhythmias. In our published data, we have: 1] Identified ten unique genetic causes of JSRD (nearly half of the published causes), 2] Generated genotype-phenotype correlations involving cerebellar, retinal, renal, hepatic, digit, and cerebral manifestations. 3] Identified common founder mutations that allow for population-based screening. 4] Discovered that JSRD encoded proteins frequently localize to the cilium. 5] Identified ciliary transition zone (TZ) defects in cells with JSRD mutations. 6] Performed siRNA cell-based screens for defective ciliogenesis to prioritize candidate JSRD genes. 7] Generated and characterized multiple zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models for JSRD. 8] Defined the concept of ‘Ciliary localization’ model, in which one JSRD gene is required for ciliary localization of other JSRD proteins. In our unpublished data we have: 1] Recruited an additional 200 JSRD patients without molecular diagnosis. 2] Performed whole exome (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on an additional 100 JSRD families. 3] Identified an additional 12 novel likely JSRD candidate genes. 4] Generated IPSCs and cerebellar organoids from mutation-positive and negative families to aid in functional analysis and gene discovery using RNAseq. 5] Begun functional validation of the putative mutations. 6] Developed methods to interrogate ciliary structure in a high-throughput fashion with electron microscopy (EM). The goal of this competing renewal is to identify the remaining ‘discoverable’ genes that lead to JSRD when lost, functionally validate mutations within the pathogenetic framework, and test the hypothesis that mutations in JSRD genes lead to collapse of the ciliary TZ. Because the majority of patients still have unknown cause of disease, this renewal aims to advance knowledge through molecular characterization of new genes, using newly evolving high-throughput techniques, integrated bioinformatics, and a unique resource of consanguineous families recruited world-wide. We further aim to validate these mutations in patient cells, within a mechanistic framework that JSRD genes are required for essential ciliary structural components during cerebellar development. Project Narrative Joubert syndrome is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder unified by defects of the cellular primary cilium.
