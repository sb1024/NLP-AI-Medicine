"TOPIC 389 - INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE FOR RADIATION THERAPY PLANNING INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE FOR RADIATION THERAPY PLANNING Besides surgery, radiotherapy is the most effective treatment modality for localized prostate cancer. The success of radiotherapy stems from the exploit of a therapeutic window in tumor response and normal tissue tolerance which maximizes the chance of sterilizing the tumor while sparing the surrounding normal tissue from severe damage. This requires an accurate and individualized radiation dose distribution generated from the examination of the patient’s medical images. Radiation therapy is technically complex and labor intensive. Intensive human supervision and intervention are needed throughout the path of patient care.   Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies are adept at automating workflows and tasks—in this case the development of cancer treatment plans. We believe that this machine learning has incredible potential to address inherent problems in the existing treatment planning workflow. Our approach will mitigate the current issues with treatment planning, integrate seamlessly with day-to-day operations, and will serve as a treatment solution that benefits patients in a way that limits their risk and extends their lives.   The goal of this project is to develop a start-to-end prostate cancer treatment planning system. We will work with three expert radiation oncology teams to archive existing patient data for use in training of artificial intelligence algorithms. These algorithms will enable high quality plans to be generated with ease. At the completion of Phase I, we will have a prototype interface that will allow users to create treatment plans and segmentation using artificial intelligence algorithms. Additionally, users will be able to evaluate these plans against other expert plans and against the training data. n/a",TOPIC 389 - INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE FOR RADIATION THERAPY PLANNING,10027492,5N91019C00053,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cancer Patient', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Pythons', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation therapy', 'Risk', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'data reduction', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'response', 'stem', 'success', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'web interface']",NCI,"RADIASOFT, LLC",N43,2019,300000,0.013501316465635438
"Deep learning techniques for time-of-flight PET detectors Project Summary/Abstract One of the key advances in modern positron emission tomography (PET) systems for clinical imaging is the use of time-of-flight (TOF) information. In cancer imaging TOF provides superior lesion detection and more accurate quantification that is crucial in measuring response to therapy, as well as in neurological and cardiovascular imaging applications. An additional benefit of TOF is the ability to lower the radiation dose or scan time without sacrificing image quality, important for patient safety and comfort. The magnitude of these clinical benefits is determined by the TOF resolution of the PET detectors, therefore the prospect of achieving unprecedented image quality and clinical imaging capabilities with superior TOF resolution has fueled significant research in developing detector technology for TOF-PET systems. However, these developments have been largely unaccompanied by advances in signal processing methods needed to extract TOF information from the detector’s electrical signals, with most detectors making use of crude analog algorithms that discard most of the useful timing information contained in the signals. Now, with the availability of low-cost fast waveform digitizers, there is an exciting opportunity to implement sophisticated digital signal processing algorithms to achieve superior TOF resolution. The main advantage of developing advanced signal processing algorithms is that it presents a cost-effective route to improved TOF resolution that is complementary to instrumentation innovations. In essence, the TOF gain comes for free; the detector signals already contain the information needed for better TOF resolution, it just needs to be used effectively. Here we propose to tailor deep learning techniques to estimate TOF from the detector signals. Deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is a powerful approach to learn complex representations of input data that can be used for tasks such as classification and regression. CNNs are therefore very suitable for directly estimating TOF from the detector waveforms, since these waveforms are influenced by several complex and intertwined processes which are hard to accurately model. Furthermore, large amounts of ground truth training data are readily generated. We recently demonstrated the feasibility of CNN-based TOF estimation, and found up to 23% improvement in TOF resolution compared to standard signal processing methods. This proposal aims to optimize these methods to push the limits of achievable TOF resolution and develop methods for their practical implementation. First, we will develop CNN architectures and methods suitable for silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) that are now used in modern TOF-PET systems. We will also optimize the digitizing parameters to make optimal use of CNNs for TOF estimation. Second, we will implement CNN-TOF methods in a modern commercial PET detector, including using a global CNN to simultaneously estimate TOF and the crystal-of-interaction from the detector waveforms, demonstrating the practical feasibility of using this promising deep learning method in next generation PET systems. Narrative The use of time-of-flight information in positron emission tomography (PET) is a powerful way to increase clinical imaging capabilities of PET, and is now used in most modern systems. Improving time-of-flight performance promises to provide substantial benefits for lesion detection in cancer imaging, kinetic modeling with dynamic imaging, and the use of lower radiation dose for patient safety. Here we introduce deep learning signal processing methods to significantly improve the performance of time-of-flight PET detectors without requiring new materials, which thereby represents a cost effective route towards maximizing the use of the rich imaging signal provided by time-of-flight.",Deep learning techniques for time-of-flight PET detectors,9784818,R03EB027268,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Digital Signal Processing', 'Electronics', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human Engineering', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Industry Collaboration', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Photons', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Solid', 'Speed', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tube', 'analog', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'clinical imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'digital', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'learning strategy', 'neural network architecture', 'next generation', 'patient safety', 'photomultiplier', 'physical process', 'response', 'scale up', 'signal processing', 'time use', 'voltage']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2019,78500,0.04785072862668879
"Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning Cerebrovascular disease remains a common cause of death and major disability in the United States, and identifying and preventing strokes should be a high priority. Direct measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) is challeng- ing in these patients, since we do not have a non-invasive, radiation-free imaging method that has been appropriately validated against gold standard techniques. This is important, because there is compelling evidence that measuring the CBF change before and after a stress test meant to increase CBF (a measurement known as cerebrovascular reserve [CVR]) can identify patients at increased stroke risk. Stress tests have been a mainstay of the diagnostic workup of cardiology patients for many years, and we believe strongly that their use will benefit cerebrovascular disease patients as well. The goal of this project is to improve the quality of arterial spin label (ASL) MRI using deep learning, a powerful form of machine learning, that is currently undergoing tremendous progress. We will then to apply this in a prospective, adaptive validation trial against oxygen-15 water PET CBF, using simultaneous PET/MRI to minimize biological variability. Finally, we will apply this improv- ed tool to study the effects of gender on CVR and its reproducibility. Successful completion of this study will result in a validated methodology to assess CVR in cerebrovascular disease patients without the use of radiation or contrast. As such, it will provide solid, evidence-based recommendations for clinicians developing new paradigms and interventions in patients with impaired CVR. There is strong evidence that imaging of cerebrovascular reserve (CVR), the ability to increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) in response to a challenge, can identify patients at increased risk of stroke. Therefore, measuring CVR would be extremely useful for designing clinical trials of interventions to mitigate this risk. However, current methods to measure CBF and CVR are suboptimal, and do not work well in patients with cerebrovascular disease. The goals of this project are • to improve non-contrast, radiation-free arterial spin label MRI methods  using deep learning, a powerful form of artificial intelligence that has  shown tremendous progress for computer vision • to validate these methods against a CBF gold-standard, oxygen-15 water  PET, using simultaneous PET/MRI, using an adaptive “play-the-winner” strategy • to apply them to assess gender differences in CVR and test their  reproducibility, with the goal of establishing age and gender normative  ranges to better identify outliers.",Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning,9789276,R01EB025220,"['Acetazolamide', 'Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Bypass', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Carotid Stenosis', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consensus', 'Cytolysis', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Excision', 'Gadolinium', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'ImProv', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Japanese Population', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Nutrient', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Premenopause', 'Procedures', 'Radiation', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Spin Labels', 'Stress Tests', 'Stroke prevention', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Waste Products', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Xenon', 'base', 'blood flow measurement', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'cerebrovascular', 'cerebrovascular imaging', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'design', 'direct application', 'disability', 'evidence based guidelines', 'gender difference', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning network', 'men', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel strategies', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'response', 'stressor', 'stroke risk', 'systematic review', 'time use', 'tool']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,586260,0.028595673832935632
"Synergistic integration of deep learning and regularized image reconstruction for positron emission tomography Project Summary/Abstract Positron emission tomography (PET) is a high-sensitivity molecular imaging modality widely used in oncology, neurology, and cardiology, with the ability to observe molecular-level activities inside a living body through the injection of specific radioactive tracers. In addition to the commonly used F-18-FDG, new tracers are being constantly developed and investigated to pinpoint specific pathways in various diseases. New PET scanners are also being proposed by exploiting time of flight (TOF) information, enabling depth of interaction capability, and extending the solid angle coverage. To realize the full potential of the new PET tracers and scanners, there is an increasing need for the development of advanced image reconstruction methods. This grant application proposes a new framework for regularized image reconstruction that synergistically integrates deep learning and regularized image reconstruction. The new framework is enabled by the recent advances in machine learning, which provide a tool to digest vast amount information embedded in existing medical images. The proposed method embeds a pre-trained deep neural network in an iterative image reconstruction framework and uses the deep neural network to regularize PET image directly. By training the deep neural network with a large amount of high-quality low-noise PET images, the proposed method can capture complex prior information from existing inter-subject and intra-subject data and thus is expected to substantially outperform the current state-of-the-art regularized image reconstruction method. The two specific aims of this exploratory proposal are (1) to develop the theoretical framework to synergistically integrate deep learning in regularized image reconstruction for PET and (2) to implement the proposed method and validate its effectiveness using existing animal data. Once the proposed method is validated using existing animal data, we will seek funding to acquire necessary human data for the implementation of the proposed method on clinical PET scanners. Project Narrative Positron emission tomography (PET) is a medical imaging technique widely used in clinic for detecting cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological disorders. This project will develop an innovative image reconstruction method that has potential to improve PET image quality and reduce radiation dose. Its success will improve the accuracy of PET for cancer detection and other diseases.",Synergistic integration of deep learning and regularized image reconstruction for positron emission tomography,9752639,R21EB026668,"['Advanced Development', 'Anatomy', 'Applications Grants', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Injections', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Neurology', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radioactive Tracers', 'Rattus', 'Role', 'Solid', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'anatomic imaging', 'animal data', 'base', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'human data', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'molecular imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural network', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2019,196250,0.01458731974867076
"Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization Project Summary Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most diagnosed form of non-cutaneous cancer in US men. The selection of patients who require immediate treatment from those suitable for active surveillance currently relies on non- specific and inaccurate measurements. A method that allows clinicians to more confidently discriminate clinically relevant from non-life-threatening tumors is needed to improve patient management. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is the preferred non-invasive imaging modality for characterizing primary PCa. However, its accuracy for detecting clinically significant PCa is variable. We propose to address this limitation by combining mpMRI with positron emission tomography (PET) with a PCa-specific radiotracer and using advanced multimodal machine learning models (i.e. radiomics and deep learning) to characterize tumor aggressiveness based on the imaging data. Recently, scanners capable of simultaneous PET and MR data acquisition in human subjects have become commercially available. An integrated MR-PET scanner is the ideal tool for comparing MR and PET derived image features to identify those that provide complementary information and build a hybrid PET-mpMRI model that most accurately identifies clinically significant tumors. While this novel technology allows the acquisition of perfectly coregistered complementary anatomical, functional and metabolic data in a single imaging session, a new challenge needs to first be addressed to obtain quantitatively accurate PET data. In an integrated MR-PET scanner, the information needed for PET attenuation correction (AC) has to be derived from the MR data and the methods currently available for this task are inadequate for advanced quantitative studies. We have formed an academic-industrial partnership to accelerate the translation of multimodal MR-PET machine learning approaches into PCa research and clinical applications by addressing the AC challenge and validating machine learning models for detecting clinically significant disease against gold standard histopathology in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Specifically, we will: (1) Develop and validate an MR-based approach for obtaining quantitatively accurate PET data. We hypothesize that attenuation maps as accurate as those obtained using a 511 keV transmission source – the true gold standard for PET AC – will be obtained; (2) Identify the multimodal radiomics model that most accurately predicts PCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that the diagnostic accuracy of this approach will be superior to that offered by the stand-alone modalities; (3) Evaluate radiomics and deep learning approaches for predicting pPCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that machine learning approaches will achieve a higher predictive accuracy when applied to data acquired simultaneously than sequentially. Project narrative A better method to non-invasively characterize primary prostate cancer is needed to improve patient management. Extracting additional information from multimodality quantitative MR-PET data using machine learning approaches is expected to result in better diagnostic performance. In this work, we propose to accelerate the translation of quantitative MR-PET to prostate cancer research and clinical applications. In particular, we will develop and validate an MR-based attenuation correction approach to guarantee that quantitatively accurate PET data are obtained in an integrated MR-PET scanner and then use machine learning approaches to characterize the aggressiveness of the tumors in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.",Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization,9653979,R01CA218187,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Death Rates', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Histopathology', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kinetics', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prostate', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone imaging', 'cancer classification', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'men', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'radiotracer', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tumor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,663746,0.05287392526970988
"Generalizing Deep Learning Reconstruction for Free-Breathing and Quantitative MRI Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this project is to increase the precision and resolution of quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Quantitative information such as tissue relaxation parameters (e.g., T1 and T2) measure tissue function and indicate disease-related changes in the heart, liver, brain, and other organs. For instance, T1 changes can provide evidence of diffuse fibrosis in the myocardium that can signal heart disease. Quantitative maps also are reproducible, directly comparable longitudinally and across subjects, and less affected by the properties of the scanner used, when compared versus common weighted (non-quantitative) clinical imaging. But, quantitative imaging involves more complicated and time-consuming pulse sequences. To accomplish this goal, this project will develop new machine learning algorithms for high-quality parameter mapping from free-breathing data. The first aim of this project will increase parameter map resolution achievable from highly accelerated, noisy data. The proposed method will integrate existing deep cascade network-based image reconstructions with convolutional network-based blocks for super-resolution and parameter map estimation. Preliminary studies suggest these new blocks improve sharpness and mitigate artifacts in the reconstructed parameter maps. The next aim will improve the training precision of such artificial neural networks to account for the significant per-voxel nonlinear fit variability in quantitative MRI. The proposed method will reweight the loss function used for calibrating these networks by the goodness-of-fit (coefficient of determination) of the reference maps obtained from fully sampled training data. Preliminary results demonstrate that quality-aware reweighting significantly improves reconstructed image quality when working with noisy training data. Experiments will evaluate the precision of both of these innovations against existing deep-learning-based reconstructions on T1 maps obtained from pre- and post-contrast cardiac images of volunteer patients. The final aim will address motion during the acquisition by estimating and tracking nonrigid motion in the data consistency stages of the deep cascade artificial neural network architecture. Two methods are proposed: deformable motion estimation already demonstrated on compressive model-based image reconstructions, and a new “re-blurring” convolutional neural network that automatically introduces artifacts into a “clean” image to match the motion-corrupted data. Both of these methods enforce consistency between motion-affected data and a motion-free image during the reconstruction. Both methods will be validated on both cardiac and abdominal images for motion artifacts and reconstruction quality against breath-held parameter mapping acquisitions. Project Narrative Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging noninvasively measures physical properties of tissue connected to cardiovascular disease and many other conditions. Novel machine learning methods for processing data to produce higher quality maps will facilitate earlier and more accurate treatment of these diseases.

"Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This “Pathway to Independence” award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA.

"Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Abstract: Fast, reliable and accurate delineation of pelvic organs in the planning and treatment images is a long- standing, important and technically challenging problem. Its solution is highly required for state-of-the-art image-guided radiation therapy planning and treatment, as better treatment decisions rely on timely interpretation of anatomical information in the images. However, automatic segmentation in male pelvic regions is always difficult due to 1) low contrast between prostate and surrounding organs, and 2) possibly disparate shapes/appearances of bladder and rectum caused by tissue deformations. The goal of this project is to create a set of novel machine learning tools to achieve accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (e.g., prostate, bladder, and rectum) in different modalities (e.g., planning CT, treatment CT/CBCT, and MRI) for radiotherapy of prostate cancer.  Planning CT. For automatic segmentation, landmark detection is often the first step in rapidly locating the target organs. Thus, in Aim 1, we will create a novel joint landmark detection approach, based on both random forests and auto-context model, to iteratively detect all landmarks and further coordinate their detection results for achieving more accurate and consistent landmark detection results. After roughly locating organs with the aid of those detected landmarks, the second step is to accurately segment boundaries of target organs in the planning CT. Accordingly, in Aim 2, we will create a set of learning methods to a) first simultaneously predict all pelvic organ boundaries in the planning CT with the regression forests trained by labeled training data, and b) then segment all pelvic organs jointly by deforming their respective shape models. In particular, to address the limitations of conventional deformable models in assuming simple Gaussian distributions for organ shapes, a novel hierarchical sparse shape composition approach will be developed to constrain shape models during deformable segmentation.  Treatment CT/CBCT. During the course of serial radiation treatments, to quantitatively record and monitor the accumulated dose delivered to the patient, organs in the treatment image also need to be segmented. Although methods proposed in Aims 1-2 can be simply applied, as done by many conventional methods, this will lead to a) inconsistent landmark detection and b) inconsistent segmentations across different treatment days because of possible large shape/appearance changes. Accordingly, in Aim 3, we will create a novel self- learning mechanism to gradually learn and incorporate patient-specific information into both joint landmark detection and deformable segmentation steps from the increasingly acquired treatment images of patient. Thus, population data will gradually be replaced by the patient's own data to train personalized models.  MRI. To guide pelvic organ segmentation in the planning CT, MRI is now often acquired for selected patients. To this end, in Aim 4, we will develop a) a prostate MRI segmentation method by using deep learning to learn MRI-specific features for guiding landmark detection and deformable segmentation as proposed in Aims 1-2; b) a novel collaborative MRI and CT segmentation algorithm for more accurate segmentation of planning CT.  All our developed algorithms will be evaluated for their performance in clinical (treatment planning and delivery) workflow for 130 patients in UNC Cancer Hospital and also hospitals of our consultants.  Benefit for Patient Care. Development of these segmentation tools will 1) dramatically accelerate the clinical workflow, 2) reduce workload (i.e., manual interaction time) for physicians, and 3) lead to better patient outcomes with reliable and accurate segmentations of target area and critical organs. Although these tools cannot replace the expertise of physicians, they can be of great assistance to physicians. Narrative Description of Project This project aims to create a set of novel machine learning tools for accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (such as prostate, bladder, and rectum) in various imaging modalities to help radiotherapy of prostate cancer. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel joint landmark detection and boundary prediction framework for accurate segmentation of the planning CT images, 2) an innovative updating mechanism for incorporating patient-specific information from previous treatment images of same patient to progressively improve treatment CT/CBCT segmentation, and 3) a deep-learning based framework for learning MRI-specific features for prostate MRI segmentation, as well as a novel method for collaborative MRI & planning CT segmentation. We will validate these methods on real patients in our clinical workflow. Besides, although these machine-learning tools are designed for radiotherapy of prostate cancer, they can also be easily extended to other new organs and new modalities after appropriate updating and training.",Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment,9745302,R01CA206100,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Hospital', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rectum', 'Sample Size', 'Shapes', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Update', 'Workload', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dosage', 'forest', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'novel', 'random forest', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment duration', 'treatment planning']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,1,0.0459081079975369
"Low- and Zero-dose Contrast-enhanced MRI Using Deep Learning Project Summary Motivation: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are used in approximately a third of all MRI scans. The unique relaxation parameters of GBCAs create indispensable image contrast for a wide range of clinical applications, such as angiography and tumor detection. However, the usage of GBCAs has been linked to the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). NSF can be painful, cause severe disability, and even death. The risk of developing NSF prevents millions of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) from receiving contrast-enhanced MRI exams. The recent identification of gadolinium deposition within the brain and body has raised additional safety concerns about the usage of GBCAs. Studies have demonstrated increased signal intensity on the unenhanced T1-weighted MR images that is correlated with previous GBCA exposure, and this gadolinium retention is independent of renal function. While initial reports focused on linear GBCAs, more recent reports show that gadolinium deposition occurs with macrocyclic GBCAs as well, albeit at lower levels. FDA has recently issued warnings about gadolinium retention following contrast-enhanced MRI, and required GBCA manufacturers to conduct human and animal studies to further assess the safety of these contrast agents. This project addresses these concerns by developing low-dose and zero-dose contrast-enhanced MRI using artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL). Approach: This fast-track project has two phases and three aims. Aim 1 (Phase I) is to develop a DL method that can synthesize full-dose contrast-enhanced MR images using pre-contrast images and contrast-enhanced images acquired with only 10% of standard GBCA dose. A software infrastructure will be constructed to seamlessly integrate the DL software between MR scanners and PACS. Aim 2 (Phase II) is to develop a DL method that can synthesize full-dose contrast-enhanced MR images using GBCA-free acquisitions with different image contrast. In Aim 3 (Phase II), we will clinically validate and evaluate both low-dose and zero-dose DL methods, including on patients with mild- to-moderate CKD. Non-inferiority tests and diagnostic performance of the synthesized full-dose images compared to the true full-dose images will be performed. Significance: This work will lead to safer contrast-enhanced MRI. The low-dose and zero-dose contrast-enhanced MRI method will benefit not only millions of patients with advanced CKD, who cannot currently undergo contrast-enhanced MRI, but many more patients with normal kidney function, who are at the risk of gadolinium retention after contrast-enhanced MRI. Project Narrative Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are widely used in MRI exams to create indispensable image contrast for monitoring treatment and investigating pathology and function. However, the usage of GBCAs has been linked to the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, preventing patients with advanced chronic kidney disease from receiving contrast-enhanced MRI exams, as well as potential gadolinium deposition in the body and brain for patients with normal kidney function. This project aims to address these problems by developing and validating low-dose and zero-dose contrast-enhanced MRI using deep learning. !",Low- and Zero-dose Contrast-enhanced MRI Using Deep Learning,9776655,R44EB027560,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Infrastructure', 'Kidney Failure', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis\xa0', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Relaxation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Validation', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'learning strategy', 'prevent', 'software development', 'tumor']",NIBIB,"SUBTLE MEDICAL, INC.",R44,2019,185379,0.051282848095675106
"Improved Techniques for Substitute CT Generation from MRI datasets This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET for PET/MR and target delineation for radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from only MR-data. Unfortunately, MRI has limited capability to resolve bone and the inability of most MR acquisitions to distinguish between air and bone makes segmentation of these tissues types challenging. This project will utilize deep learning, a new and growing area of machine learning, to develop new methodology to create substitute CT images from rapid MR acquisitions that can be utilized in PET/MR and radiation treatment planning workflows. In Aim 1 we will study rapid MR acquisitions to be used with deep learning approaches for sCT generation in the head and pelvis using 3T PET/MR images matched with PET/CT imaging to create deep learning training and evaluation datasets. Different deep learning networks and MR inputs will be studied and adapted to determine the best PET reconstruction performance. In Aim 2 we will investigate rapid but motion-resilient approaches to whole- body MR imaging for subsequent deep learning-based substitute CT generation. In an exploratory subaim, we also propose to study methods of sCT generation that only utilize PET-only data. The data acquired in Aim 2 will be used to create comprehensive whole-body, motion-resilient datasets for training and evaluation of deep learning networks. In Aim 3 we will evaluate substitute CT approaches for MR-only radiation treatment planning. MR-only approaches will be compared to standard CT-based treatment simulation in the brain, head & neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and deep learning networks will be optimized and evaluated for region- specific RT planning and simulation. Additionally, transfer learning approaches will be studied to extend sCT to a 0.35T MR-Linac to demonstrate respiratory motion resolved substitute CT generation. This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET in PET/MR and target delineation in radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from MR-only data.

"Developing Database and Software infrastructure for Quantitative Radiologic Analysis of Lumbar Radiculopathy Project Summary/Abstract Diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy (LR) currently relies on a qualitative interpretation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies and lacks standardization. This has led to inconsistent treatment and rising costs, while quality of life metrics have remained stagnant. To standardize the diagnosis of LR, the subjective and qualitative radiologic assessment needs to be augmented with accurate measurements of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas, two anatomical structures that are critical to the etiology of LR. However, precise measurements will require manual delineations of these regions on MRI. This is a tedious and time-consuming process that is not feasible on a daily, large-scale basis in the clinic. Deep Learning (DL) is a relatively new machine learning technique, which holds the promise of automating NF and CC segmentation. None the less, there remain several challenges to making DL-based segmentation routine in clinical practice. First, training and validating a DL model for segmentation of a given anatomical structure requires a large amount of expert annotated training data. Expert annotated data is expensive and time consuming to obtain, thus thwarting the development of quantitative imaging diagnostics for LR. To address this, we propose an expert-led manual delineation of NF and CC using de-identified MRI data extracted from UCLA's picture archiving and communications system (PACS). We expect the resulting database to contain data from over 35,000 lumbar MRI scans, with associated clinical history, demographics, and patient outcomes data. In a subset (1000) of these data, NFs and CCs will be annotated by multiple human expert raters. The consensus of these delineations will be used as ground truth segmentations to train, validate and improve our understanding of DL models. Secondly, as a part of this proposal, we aim to address several technical challenges that limit the deployment of automated image segmentation techniques to the clinic. Chief amongst these challenges is the failure of automated methodologies in the face of variation due to factors such as pathology, scanner protocol alterations, and general demographic variation. Additionally, our current understanding of DL does not allow us to categorically state the total number of expert annotated data that will be needed to train a model with a specified level of accuracy. Finally, we do not currently understand how selection of training cases for expert delineation affects generalization accuracy. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose experiments to define the relationship between DL algorithms and the cardinality of training data. We will also explore the use of unsupervised machine learning strategies, namely clustering and reinforcement learning, to understand how training data selection influences algorithmic accuracy. In summary, we propose to address data availability and technical knowledge gaps to the development of accurate DL-based techniques for automated NF and CC delineation, with a broader view to standardize the diagnosis and treatment of LR. Project Narrative Basing radiological diagnoses on a quantitative characterization of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas would greatly improve the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar radiculopathy (LR). Manual measurement of this anatomy on every clinical study is not feasible; however, deep learning- (DL) based automated methods can reliable perform this task if 1) expert annotations to train DL algorithms are available and 2) we can train DL models to work accurately despite image heterogeneity. We address these knowledge gaps by developing 1) a database containing spine MR images with expert annotation of NFs and CCs and 2) intelligent training data selection frameworks to train DL algorithms and assess their robustness to heterogeneity.",Developing Database and Software infrastructure for Quantitative Radiologic Analysis of Lumbar Radiculopathy,9746373,R21EB026665,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Categories', 'Central cord canal structure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Investigative Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural History', 'Needs Assessment', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Radiculopathy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Diseases', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical database', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'experimental study', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'network architecture', 'neural network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'relational database', 'theories', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment optimization', 'unsupervised learning']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2019,234000,0.006121742826465222
"Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking PROJECT SUMMARY  Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures tissue parameters such as T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion to detect subtle differences in tissue states (such as microstructure, diffuse fibrosis, edema, hemorrhage, and iron content) from neurological, oncological, and cardiovascular diseases. Because each parameter offers complementary tissue information, multiparameter mapping is very promising for risk assessment, early detection, accurate staging, and treatment monitoring of disease. However, quantitative MRI is typically very time consuming and difficult to perform. Each parameter is typically measured from its own series of images, so measuring multiple parameters leads to long, inefficient scanning sessions. Furthermore, cardiac and breathing motion creates misalignment between images, causing additional problems.  The standard approach to motion is to either remove it (e.g., ask the patient to hold their breath) or to synchronize image acquisition with it (e.g., using electrocardiography (ECG) to monitor cardiac motion). This approach makes scan times even longer, limits imaging to patients who can repeatedly perform long breath holds (which is difficult for aging or weak patients) and who have predictable cardiac motion (which is not true of patients with cardiac arrhythmias). Furthermore, these methods are often unreliable and difficult to perform.  This project is to develop and validate a new technology, MR Multitasking, to perform multiple simultaneous measurements in a single, push-button scan that is both comfortable for patients and simple for technologists to perform. MR Multitasking redesigns quantitative MRI around the concept of images as functions of many time dimensions, each corresponding to a different dynamic process (e.g., motion, T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion), and then uses mathematical models called low-rank tensors to perform fast, multidimensional imaging. This allows continuous acquisition of imaging data even while the subject is moving, providing motion-resolved parameter maps without breath holding or motion synchronization. We will scan healthy subjects, liver patients, prostate cancer patients, and cardiovascular patients to develop and validate this technology and use artificial intelligence to quickly reconstruct images from the collected data. The resulting tool will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to answer a wide range of biomedical questions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project is to develop and validate a one-stop, push-button solution for comprehensive, motion- resolved quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This will be accomplished by cultivating a new technology, MR Multitasking, which can measure multiple tissue biomarkers in a single scan, even in moving organs. The resulting technology will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to diagnose, monitor, and study a wide range of diseases.","Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking",9766063,R01EB028146,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Fibrosis', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Iron', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'body system', 'deep learning', 'heart motion', 'image reconstruction', 'magnetic field', 'magnetohydrodynamic', 'mathematical model', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'time use', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,676760,0.054593840177523494
"Content-based MR-TRUS Fusion without Tracking There are about 3 million American men living with prostate cancer, the second leading cause of cancer death for men in the United States. If the prostate cancer is caught early before it spreads to other parts of the body, by active monitoring or treatment, most men will not die from it. Nevertheless, 22% to 47% of the patients with negative biopsies but elevated prostate-specific antigen levels may still harbor malignant tumors, which can be life threatening and could have been missed by the commonly used ultrasound guided random biopsy. By contrast, fusion of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) for guiding targeted biopsies has shown to significantly improve the cancer detection rate. However, MR-TRUS fusion itself is very challenging due to the difficulties in directly registering images of these two very different modalities in different dimensions. To bypass the difficult registration problems, the existing fusion techniques require the use of specialized expensive and cumbersome hardware tracking devices, which increases cost and elongates procedures. More importantly, due to a number of factors such as patient movement, respiratory motion and ultrasound transducer pressure change, prostate motion can happen during a procedure and cause the images to be misaligned. Timely noticing and correcting such motion require great skill and knowledge of radiological imaging, where studies show a steep learning curve for mastering fusion systems. Failing in image registration and motion compensation renders the fusion guided biopsy performing no differently than random biopsy. To address the fundamental cause of the problems, the goal of this project is to create enabling technology of MR- TRUS image fusion solely based on internal image content without using external tracking devices. The proposed research is foundational for developing next generation of MR-TRUS fusion guidance systems for prostate biopsy to achieve robust performance with lower costs. Recent advancement in machine learning, especially deep learning, has provided us new tools and new angles to tackle this challenging problem. This project aims for directly fusing 2D TRUS frames with 3D MR volume by developing novel deep learning methods for image reconstruction and registration. The proposed methods are designed to exploit both population and patient specific imaging information to accurately align images. As all learning-based image registration methods try to better use population knowledge to improve the registration performance, few of them have been able to efficiently use patient specific information, which can be essential to obtain robust and accurate performance. Upon successful completion, the innovation created from the project will disrupt the common perception that hardware tracking has to be used for multimodal image fusion-guided interventions and alleviate the demand on physicians’ experience and skill in image analysis and fusion to help obtain consistent results. This project will lead to the development of novel prostate biopsy systems and will also impact a range of other image fusion based interventional guidance technologies. Fusion of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) for guiding targeted prostate biopsies can significantly improve the detection of aggressive cancer. The goal of this project is to create enabling technology of MR-TRUS image fusion solely based on internal image content without using external tracking devices.

"Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement ABSTRACT This proposal aims to develop deep learning methods to automate the extraction of morphological imaging features relevant to knee osteoarthritis (OA), and total knee replacement. While, quantitative evaluation Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a central role in OA research in the clinical setting MR reports often tend to be subjective, qualitative, and the grading schemes utilized in epidemiological research are not used because they are extraordinarily time consuming and do not lend themselves to the demands of todays changing healthcare scenario. The “Big Data” challenge and opportunity facing us makes it necessary to build enabling tools (i) to automate the extraction of morphological OA imaging features, with the aim of evaluating disease progression prediction capabilities on larger sample sizes that have never been explored before; (ii) to discover latent patterns by uncovering unexplored data-driven imaging features by the application of state of the art deep learning approaches (1); (iii) combine multi-modality imaging with clinical, functional, activity, and other data to define the trajectory of joint degeneration in OA. Leveraging the power of these state of the art techniques, and with the extraordinary availability of a large datasets of annotated images; in this project, we propose to develop an automatic post-processing pipeline able to segment musculoskeletal tissues and identify morphological OA features in Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI), as defined by commonly used MRI grading systems. Automation of morphological grading of the tissues in the joint would be a significant breakthrough in both OA research and clinical practice. It would enable the analysis of large sample sizes, assist the radiologist/clinician in the grading of images, take a relatively short amount of time, reduce cost, and could potentially, improve classification models. The availability of automatic pipelines for the identification of morphological abnormities in MRI would drastically change clinical practice, and include semi-quantitative grades, rather than subjective impressions in radiology clinical reports. In this study, we also aim to develop a complete supervised deep learning approach to obtain data-driven representations as non-linear and semantic aggregation among elementary features able to exploit the latent information hidden in the complexity of a 3D MR images, eliminating the need for nominal grades of selected features. This second aim, while being at high risk has also a potential exceptional high impact; as it departs from the classical hypothesis driven studies, and builds a novel translational platform to revolutionize morphological grading of MR images in research studies, but also is paradigm-shifting in that it may provide a more quantitative feature driven basis for routine radiological clinical reports. The clinical impact of this proposal lies in the third aim (R33 phase), in which we propose to translate the solutions developed in the R61 phase on images in the UCSF clinical archives (PACS), and plan to include also demographic and clinical data in the electronic health records, to build the models defining total knee replacements. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deep learning is revolutionizing medical imaging by solving challenging problems in disease classification, progression and therapeutic response. In this project, we focus on using deep learning methodology on magnetic resonance images of the knee to study osteoarthritis prevalence, and progression. The usage of features derived from the imaging data, rather than established, and often subjective grading schemes, will have significant impact on clinical radiology, establishing quantitative physician assist tools with an ultimate goal of reducing the economic and healthcare burden of total knee replacement.!",Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement,9669002,R61AR073552,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Big Data', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cartilage', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Economics', 'Edema', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Ligaments', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scheme', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Subchondral Cyst', 'Supervision', 'Synovitis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'disease classification', 'drug discovery', 'epidemiology study', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'joint destruction', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'learning strategy', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'patient population', 'radiologist', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R61,2019,447173,0.025933589240235387
"Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques PROJECT SUMMARY Symptomatic urinary stone disease (USD) affects >8% of the United States population, resulting in an estimated annual medical cost exceeding $10 billion. Computed tomography (CT) is the established method for imaging urinary calculi and can provide accurate sub-millimeter details of the size and location of renal stones. However, in vivo characterization of more than just size and location is critical for quantifying stone characteristics important for optimal patient health management and essential for clinical research. A complete characterization of renal stones, including stone composition and fragility, is needed for safe and cost effective management of USD, as well as for phenotyping of research subjects. Our proposal meets these needs by developing methods to accurately and non-invasively characterize stones using low-dose, multi-energy CT. Our long-term goal is to use advanced CT methodologies to characterize urinary calculi for the purpose of directing clinical treatment and facilitating clinical investigation. Our objectives in this application are to develop and validate in vivo quantitative techniques for characterizing mixed and non-uric-acid stone types, as well as for predicting the likelihood of successful stone comminution, a novel concept we refer to as stone fragility. These image-based stone biometrics will enable evidence-based identification of treatment strategies that maximize effectiveness while minimizing risk, as well as accurate and non-invasive classification of research subjects to accelerate scientific advances in the understanding and treatment of USD. We will meet these objectives by accomplishing the following specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Develop and validate CT techniques to characterize mixed and non-uric-acid  stone types.  Specific Aim 2: Develop and validate CT techniques to predict stone fragility. Current state-of-the-art stone imaging technology cannot accurately identify the composition of mixed and non- uric-acid stone types, nor can it provide quantitative indications of the likelihood of efficient comminution using the lowest risk technique. The innovation of this proposal lies in the use of newly developed statistical, deep learning and texture analysis techniques to quantitatively describe essential characteristics of urinary calculi, namely composition and fragility. The significance of this proposal is that the knowledge derived from using such techniques represents unique quantitative biomarkers that will allow physicians and researchers to more effectively manage and study USD. The developed methods respond to critical needs in the field of stone disease and will advance the ability of physicians to optimally direct patient therapy and scientists to phenotype research subjects. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will develop imaging techniques that can determine urinary stone composition and fragility in patients. The significance of this is that these advanced CT imaging techniques will allow physicians to more efficiently direct patient therapy and perform clinical research, potentially avoiding procedures associated with higher risk or cost.","Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques",9798875,R01EB028591,"['Affect', 'Alkalies', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Calcium Oxalate', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cost Effective Management', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Effectiveness', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Subjects', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'United States', 'Ureteroscopy', 'Uric Acid', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'calcium phosphate', 'clinical investigation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'evidence base', 'health management', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'photon-counting detector', 'prevent', 'risk minimization', 'treatment strategy']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,357486,0.03028052635555697

The methods will include integrity checking of normal anatomy and target volume structures to identify potential manual or automatic contouring errors. The system will be used to automate treatment plan generation from the point when structures have been drawn until the plan requires expert assessment/approval. Plans for patients in each risk category will be validated against those generated and approved by three expert radiation oncologists, where assessment criteria is decided upon a priori by consensus between experts. Benefits include time savings via use of knowledge-driven versus trial and error-based plan objectives, more personalized treatment plans and improved quality control. n/a",DEVELOPMENT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) TOOLS TO UNDERSTAND AND DUPLICATE EXPERTS RADIATION THERAPY PLANNING FOR PROSTATE CANCER,10027481,5N91019C00044,"['Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cancer Patient', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dose', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Quality Control', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Structure', 'Structure of base of prostate', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'base', 'high risk', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'prostate cancer risk', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NCI,"ONCOSPACE, INC.",N01,2019,299433,-0.00025829828165657487
"Automatic Thoracic Organ Segmentation Tool for Radiation Treatment Planning of Cancers in Thoracic Region ABSTRACT As early detection and better treatment have increased cancer patient survival rates, the importance of protecting normal organs during radiation treatment is drawing more attention. Cancers in the thoracic region, which include lung, esophageal, thymus, mesothelioma and breast cancers, are among the most pervasive and deadly cancers. The protection of normal thoracic organs including lungs, heart, esophagus and spinal cord is critical in reducing long term toxicity in such cancers. To avoid excessively high radiation doses to such organs-at-risk (OARs), they are required to be correctly segmented from simulation computed tomography (CT) scans during radiation treatment planning to get an accurate dosage distribution. Despite tremendous effort into the development of semi- or fully-automatic segmentation solutions, current automated segmentation software, mostly using the atlas-based methods, has not yet reached the level of accuracy and robustness required for clinical usage. Therefore, in current practice, significant manual efforts are still required in the OAR segmentation process. Manual contouring suffers from inter- and intra-observer variability as well as institutional variability where different sites adopt distinct contouring atlases and labeling criteria and thus leads to inaccuracy and variability in OAR segmentation. When OARs are very close to the treatment target, segmentation errors as small as a few millimeters can have a statistically significant impact on dosimetry distribution and outcome. In addition, it is also costly and time consuming as it can take 1-2 hours of a clinicians’ time to segment major thoracic organs due to the large number of axial slices required. The associated human efforts would significantly increase if adaptive radiation therapy (ART) is used as OARs from two or more simulation CT scans need to be segmented to adjust treatment plans. In recent years, the rapid development of deep learning methods has revolutionized many computer-vision areas and the adoption of deep learning in medical applications has shown great success. Based on a deep-learning-based algorithm we developed that achieved better-than-human performance and ranked 1st in 2017 American Association of Physicist in Medicine Thoracic Auto-segmentation Challenge, a thoracic OAR auto-segmentation product will be developed in this project with the two aims: 1) improve and validate the deep-learning-based automatic thoracic organ segmentation algorithm on a larger clinical data set, and 2) incorporate this algorithm into a preliminary product that fits into the clinical workflow. With this product, the segmentation accuracy can be improved, leading to more robust treatment plans in protecting normal organs and improved long term patient outcome. Furthermore, the time and cost of radiation treatment planning can be greatly reduced, contributing to a more affordable cancer treatment and reduced healthcare burden.

"Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is notoriously difficult to diagnose non-invasively, and current methods of assessing CMD utilize only the peak velocity of the coronary flow pattern. While new imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved the assessment coronary perfusion, there are currently no non-invasive methods that incorporate the coronary flow pattern over a complete cardiac cycle to definitively assess and predict the development of CMD.  Coronary blood flow (CBF) reflects the summation of flow in the coronary microcirculation, and our lab has begun to harness the full CBF pattern under varying flow and disease conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes) to determine whether it might harbor novel clues leading to the early detection of CMD. Our past and preliminary data indicate an early onset of CMD in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that occurs prior to the onset of macrovascular complications and that are characterized by blood flow impairments and alterations in coronary resistance microvessel (CRM) structure, function, and biomechanics. Our data also uncovered innovative correlations between CRM structure/biomechanics and our newly-defined features of the coronary flow pattern, some of which were unique to normal or diabetic mice. We have initially utilized these CBF features, in the presence and absence of other factors such as cardiac function, to develop a mathematical model in collaboration with Drs. Christopher Bartlett and William Ray that to date demonstrated that 6 simple factors can predict a normal vs. diabetic coronary flow pattern with 85% predictive accuracy. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the leading cause of heart disease and is associated with hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMD) is comprised of structural and functional deficits of the tiny coronary arteries that may be an earlier indicator of disease prior to the onset of overt CAD. The proposed multidisciplinary research aims to develop a computational artificial intelligence model that will accurately predict CMD based on a non-invasive coronary flow pattern obtained by Doppler echocardiography.",Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease,9769734,R21EB026518,"['Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic mouse', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doppler Echocardiography', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elements', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperemia', 'Hypertension', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Publications', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'coronary perfusion', 'db/db mouse', 'diabetic', 'disorder prevention', 'early onset', 'experimental study', 'heart function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'macrovascular disease', 'mathematical model', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent']",NIBIB,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R21,2019,228000,0.023197598630972684
"Ultraportable Stroke CT Based on Stationary Carbon Nanotube X-ray Source and Deep Learning Image Formation PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this 12-month SBIR phase 1 project is developing an imaging device that will enable highly efficient and cost-effective stroke imaging for patients suffered trauma events. The expected technical outcome will be a proof-of-concept head CT imaging system with sub- second imaging speed, sub-mSv radiation dose, and high-quality images. Imaging systems with such capabilities will address the current deficiency in timely diagnosis of stroke patients, and benefit society with higher efficiency and lower cost. Such imaging device will make a strong economic impact on the global head CT imaging market, which is estimated to be about $36 billion in the U.S. In a longer term, the novel imaging technology could be translated into markets for security screening, industry inspection, and dental imaging. This project is based on the recent research results by Dr. Cao's team under the support of an NSF CAREER award (PI Dr. Cao, 08/01/2014-07/31/2019, $400,000) and a Dr. Cao's Commonwealth Research Commercialization Fund (CRCF) award (Title: “Computed Tomography Without Moving Parts for Fast and Portable Biomedical Imaging”, 07/01/2017- 06/30/2019, $100,000). The project has a strong footing in intellectual property. The technology is protected by a few patent applications at the Virginia Tech, including US. 62/316649, “Ultrafast Micro-CT for Imaging Free-Moving Animals” (Inventor: Guohua Cao), and PCT/US2013/061049 and US14/429835, “System and Method of Stationary Source Computed Tomography” (Inventor: Guohua Cao, et. al.). In this project, the team will design and build a proof-of-concept head CT platform to test the feasibility of ultraportable and compact head CT based on the stationary carbon nanotube x-ray source design and deep learning image reconstruction algorithm. The expected outcomes from this project include demonstration of the feasibility for ultrafast, low dose, and diagnostic imaging capabilities for intracerebral hemorrhage in head phantoms (ICH), with potential automatic ICH identification through deep learning algorithm. A ready-to- prototype head CT device will be optimized and designed, and a corresponding business plan will be developed.

"Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI Project Summary/Abstract Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) provides arguably the most comprehensive evaluation of the cardiovascular system; however, respiratory motion continues to adversely impact CMR, causing artifacts that lead to poor image quality, repeated scans, and decreased throughput, and thus represents a significant obstacle to clinical utility. For single-shot CMR, cardiac and breathing motions are “frozen” by limiting the acquisition to an end-diastolic window less than 200 ms. For first pass perfusion, breathing motion cannot be eliminated because data from 50 to 60 consecutive heartbeats are required to capture contrast dynamics. For other single-shot applications such as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and parameter mapping, respiratory motion is introduced when the acquisition is repeated across several heartbeats to improve spatial and temporal resolution. To eliminate respiratory motion from single-shot images, non-rigid motion correction (MOCO) has been promoted as an attractive option that provides 100% acquisition efficiently. MOCO can be used either after the reconstruction or during the reconstruction. Such techniques, however, cannot account for through-plane motion, which can only be corrected prospectively, and can fail depending on image quality and the extent of motion. Prospective compensation of the respiratory motion has been recognized as an attractive alternative to existing gating and MOCO methods. Proposed methods use one or more navigator echoes—incompatible with or inefficient for many CMR protocols—to capture the respiratory motion and rely on simple parametric models that are inadequate to describe complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion. Due to these limitations, prospective methods have found limited applicability even in research settings. We propose a new framework to prospectively compensate respiratory motion. The proposed method, called PROspective Motion compensation using Pilot Tone (PROMPT), employs Pilot Tone technology and leverages machine learning principles to first learn complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion on a patient-specific basis and then prospectively compensate the motion by tracking the imaging plane, in real time, as a function of a Pilot Tone based respiratory signal. If successful, this synergistic combination of Pilot Tone and machine learning will lead to 100% efficiency for single-shot CMR exams performed under free-breathing conditions, will eliminate the need to setup navigator echoes, respiratory bellows, or other inefficient prospective gating measures, will minimize through-plane motion that can render the images non-diagnostic for CMR applications including fast-pass perfusion, parameter mapping, LGE, and coronary angiography, will provide a reliable surrogate measure of respiratory motion, and will facilitate highly accelerated compressive recovery. Project Narrative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has many potential advantages over currently used imaging methods to diagnose heart disease, but MRI images can be ruined if the patient breathes during the scan. In this project, we will develop a method that is insensitive to breathing motion and compare it to existing methods. These efforts should lead to significant improvements in diagnosis of heart disease so that patients may benefit from appropriate treatment.",Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI,9762101,R21EB026657,"['Anatomy', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Freezing', 'Gadolinium', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'healthy volunteer', 'heart motion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,223680,0.06052379567609855
"Real-time prostate lesion tracking during SBRT Multiple randomized clinical trials have shown that delivery of higher radiation doses to the prostate results in improved tumor control rates in prostate cancer radiation therapy (RT). As local recurrence mostly occurs at the primary tumor, particularly for high-risk patients, additional dose escalation is expected to improve the treatment outcome. However, the application of dose escalation for prostate RT is greatly limited by the tolerance of nearby healthy tissues that cannot adequately be excluded from the radiation field. This limitation can be overcome by dose painting, where a higher dose is applied to the prostate tumor only instead of the whole prostate gland. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) offers reduced treatment time, convenience, and possibly increased treatment efficacy as compared to the conventionally fraction scheme. UTSW is currently conducting a dose escalation trial using SBRT for high-risk prostate cancer patients with an integrated dose boost on MRI-visualized prostate tumor. However, prostate can move and deform during the beam delivery. To ensure the escalated dose is actually delivered to tumor regions as planned, a reliable tumor tracking method is urgently needed. While intra-prostatic tumors can be identified by multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) for treatment planning, intrafraction tumor tracking during the beam delivery is not achievable with mpMRI. In contrast, ultrasound offers a cost-effective and real-time imaging with high soft tissue contrast. However, conventional ultrasound techniques only provide anatomic structure of the prostate gland without the capability to differentiate tumor region from the rest of the prostate gland. Temporal enhanced ultrasound (TeUS) has emerged as a new paradigm for prostate tissue characterization by analyzing the time-series ultrasound images with advanced machine learning techniques. In this project, we aim to develop, optimize and evaluate an innovative TeUS based intra-prostatic tumor tracking method to guide SBRT with an integrated dose boost for high-risk prostate cancer patients. The specific aims are: 1) Develop TeUS-based intra-prostatic tumor delineation for guiding focused dose escalation; 2) Integrate and validate TeUS-based tumor tracking system during SBRT; and 3) Evaluate clinical gain of TeUS guided SBRT for high risk prostate cancer patients. Successful completion of the proposed project will lead to the development and validation of a low-cost yet highly accurate TeUS guided system for targeted prostate cancer RT. With enhanced real-time visualization of tumor, the use of TeUS for RT guidance will lead to better treatment efficacy and reduced toxicity. Delivery of higher radiation doses to the tumor region can improve outcome of radiation therapy for high-risk prostate cancer patients. As the prostate can move and deform during radiation beam delivery, there is an urgent need for a reliable method to ensure escalated dose is delivered to the tumor region as planned. We will develop, integrate and evaluate a novel prostate tumor tracking method based on temporal enhanced ultrasound (TeUS) to guide radiation therapy for high-risk patients, which will lead to higher local control with improved toxicity.",Real-time prostate lesion tracking during SBRT,9713860,R01EB027898,"['Aftercare', 'Anatomy', 'Area Under Curve', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'External Beam Radiation Therapy', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Imagery', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Probability', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Prostatic', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rectum', 'Recurrence', 'Rest', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapy trial', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urethra', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'early phase trial', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prostate biopsy', 'prostate cancer risk', 'real-time images', 'soft tissue', 'standard care', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'vibration']",NIBIB,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,373971,-0.007620371010211813
"Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma Glioblastoma is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Despite advances in neurosurgical resection, radiation targeting, and chemotherapy, the prognosis remains grim with a median survival of just 15 months. The effectiveness of current radiation therapy strategies is severely limited by shortcomings in the imaging modalities used to develop treatment plans. Current radiation therapy planning is mainly based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, which identifies high grade tumors that are immediately associated with leaky neovasculature. Although it is an excellent diagnostic tool to identify high grade from low grade tumors, it is unable to signal occult infiltration beyond the core of the tumor. Though many believe GBM to be an incurable disease, we believe we have identified a method for optimizing tumor targeting that will increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy. A significant component of the current problem in GBM therapy is the lack of treatment for non-enhancing regions that are significantly infiltrated by neoplastic glioma cells without neovascularization. This untreated population undoubtedly leads to early recurrence. The proposed study addresses an important step toward translating an advanced quantitative imaging modality that complements the conventional imaging that is capable of reliably revealing glioma- infiltrated regions for precise, personalized treatment targeting. Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an alternative modality able to identify endogenous metabolism within tissue without the need for exogenous contrast, and has been shown to identify the metabolic abnormalities associated with tumor beyond the regions identified by T1-weighted MRI. The clinical integration of sMRI in patient management has been limited due to the computational challenges of analysis of sMRI data. Two key hurdles to be overcome are the insufficiency of filters to remove image artifacts and the necessity of quantification of metabolic levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism. As a result, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and many hours of computational and user time. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in radiation therapy planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning, an approach to computation that has shattered benchmarks in many medical and non-medical problems. Specifically, we will develop filters for removing artifacts, algorithms for personalized diagnosis of tumor infiltration, and explore deep learning as a method to synthesize sMRI data with anatomical and clinical metrics in a fully automated fashion. Success in the proposed work will produce a “scanner-to-clinician” platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into the clinical radiation therapy planning paradigm. Ultimately, we believe this additional modality in the physician's tool belt will lead to better outcomes in patients suffering from this debilitating disease. Project Narrative  Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is a molecular imaging modality that can accurately detect abnormalities in the metabolic signatures of tumor cells, making it ideal for the detection and monitoring of highly infiltrative brain tumors like glioblastoma. Clinical adoption of sMRI has been slow due to limited tools for expedient and objective processing of sMRI data into information that oncologists can use for therapy planning. This proposal addresses these challenges using recent advances in high performance computing and machine learning to develop a software framework for using sMRI in the clinical management of patients with glioblastoma.",Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma,9638528,F30CA206291,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Excision', 'Gaussian model', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Infiltration', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Neoplasms', 'Oncologist', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Framework', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'dosage', 'expectation', 'genomic data', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning network', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'metabolic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodal data', 'neoplastic', 'neoplastic cell', 'neovascularization', 'neovasculature', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'software development', 'spectroscopic data', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'syntax', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'white matter']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F30,2019,50016,-0.0045409878279028355
"An interactive deep-learning method to semi-automatically segment abdominal organs to support stereotactic MR guided online adaptive radiotherapy (SMART) for abdominal cancers Abstract  Stereotactic MRI-guided online adaptive radiotherapy (SMART) is an effective treatment for the pancreas and other upper abdominal cancers.

In the clinical workflow of SMART, manual segmentation of the GI orangs at risk (OARs) is one of the most important but also the most labor-intensive steps. Manual segmentation takes 10 minutes on average but ranges from 5 to 22 minutes. The slow and costly manual segmentation step directly decreases the accessibility and affordability of online SMART and indirectly reduces the effectiveness of SMART due to intra-fractional body and organ movement of the patients. In this study, we will develop a deep-learning based interactive and semi-automatic procedure to accurately and quickly segment the GI OARs to make SMART more efficient and affordable. Stereotactic MRI-guided online adaptive radiotherapy (SMART) has been demonstrated as an effective treatment for the pancreas and other upper abdominal cancers. For nonresectable pancreatic cancer, SMART increased the overall survival at 36 months from 18% to 55% compared to conventional radiation therapy (RT) treatment. In this study, we will develop a deep-learning based interactive and semi-automatic method to accurately and quickly segment the organs-at- risk (OAR) in the abdomen to support SMART. The method to be developed will significantly expedite the OAR segmentation step and make SMART more efficient and affordable.",An interactive deep-learning method to semi-automatically segment abdominal organs to support stereotactic MR guided online adaptive radiotherapy (SMART) for abdominal cancers,9807610,R03EB028427,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Clinical', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dose', 'Dose-Rate', 'Duodenum', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Kidney', 'Large Intestine', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of abdomen', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Toxicity', 'Radiation therapy', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Small Intestines', 'Stomach', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'computerized', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'gastrointestinal', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'irradiation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'preservation', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment duration', 'tumor']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R03,2019,89216,0.010956837157104122
"A TOF, DOI, MRI compatible PET detector to support sub-millimeter neuroPET imaging Abstract The overall goal of this research is to develop next generation positron emission tomography (PET) detector technology to support non-invasive, quantitative brain imaging at spatial and temporal resolutions currently not achievable with human neuro-PET systems. The developed PET detector technology will also be compatible with operation in an MRI system. The proposed research is targeted to the NIH Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) initiative. Human brain imaging with PET/MRI will be an essential tool in neuroscience studies to ""Develop innovative technologies to understand the human brain and treat its disorders; create and support integrated brain research networks."" The key advancement that we introduce is a PET detector with <100 psec time-of-flight (TOF) PET coincidence resolution, <2 mm continuous depth of interaction (DOI) positioning and intrinsic detector spatial resolution to support <1 mm PET image resolution throughout the system imaging field of view (FOV). Detector modules have been designed that individually achieve these performance metrics; however, no detector module has been designed that supports all of them. To make disruptive advancements in neuro-imaging using PET, one must push the image spatial resolution (i.e., currently 2-3 mm image resolution) as well as coincidence timing resolution and also be MRI compatible. The impact of this project is that we will advance the state of the art in all of these critical performance areas. We will achieve these goals by first understanding the role that different PET detector performance parameters have on task-based figures of merit for neuroPET imaging. We will investigate how both TOF and image resolution impact figure of merit performance for estimation, detection and characterization imaging tasks. Monte Carlo simulation will be used along with both object-based (i.e., mathematical) and anthropomorphic digital phantoms. Next we will optimize SiPM device selection, electronics and detector geometry for <100 psec TOF coincidence timing, 1 mm intrinsic spatial resolution and <2 mm DOI positioning resolution. We will build and characterize a prototype PET detector module utilizing a novel dual- sided slat crystal detector design. To advance coincidence timing performance we will investigate the use of machine learning to estimate the arrival time of detected events. Finally, we will optimize the detector design for MRI compatibility. We will fully test and characterize performance of our prototype detector on the benchtop and in a MRI scanner while running clinical MRI pulse sequences. At the end of this developmental project we will be in position to build a state of the art, MRI compatible, TOF, DOI PET imaging system. Narrative The overall goal of this work is to develop detector imaging technology that will enable new research into the development, function and aging of the human brain. This technology will allow functional imaging of the brain at higher spatial resolution and higher coincidence timing resolution than previously achieved and also facilitate simultaneous multi-modality imaging (i.e., PET/MRI) at these new levels of performance.","A TOF, DOI, MRI compatible PET detector to support sub-millimeter neuroPET imaging",9791188,R01EB026964,"['Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Functional Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Running', 'Side', 'Silicon', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vendor', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'brain research', 'design', 'detector', 'digital', 'imaging detector', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'operation', 'prototype', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,22992,0.05267085696229842
"High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is in response to PA 18-484. In the BRAIN 2025 Report, PET (positron emission tomography) is identified as “the best means to translate studies of neurotransmitters, receptors, and neuromodulators to humans.” However dynamic assessment of receptor occupancy and metabolism is hindered by the spatial resolution and sensitivity of even the most modern of clinically available PET scanners. To address this challenge, we propose a next generation PET detector with a highly innovative design: a detector module with a layered scintillator structure and a side readout configuration. The crystal slabs in the module are stacked along the depth direction and are optically separated by reflective films. The scintillation light created in each layer is measured by photodetectors located on the four sides of the crystal. Compared with traditional PET detectors, which contain pixelated crystal arrays, the new design has the following advantages: (1) The layered structure provides depth of interaction (DOI) information such that a smaller diameter detector ring can be used without increasing parallax error, increasing sensitivity while lowering costs. (2) The four-sided readout method improves the energy resolution of the system with increased scintillation light collection efficiency by reducing light loss due to total internal reflection. (3) Sub millimeter spatial resolution is achievable without using very small pitch crystal arrays, since the interaction location in each crystal layer is determined via machine learning- based decoding of the light distribution collected on the four crystal sides. Therefore the production cost of the crystals is reduced. (4) Since the interaction location and energy resolution for each layer are determined independently, the system sensitivity can be increased by stacking more layers in the module without affecting the spatial and energy resolution of the system. (5) For side readout setup, a larger ratio of cross-sectional area to length requires fewer photodetectors to cover all four sides of the module; this reduces photodetector cost. The first four points above have been demonstrated in preliminary studies using a small, prototype module. We propose to build a large scale detector module with this new design to verify the fifth advantage, and to study the effect of detector size on the first four. The outcome of this proposal will be two DOI enabled detector modules with excellent spatial resolution (~1 mm) and energy resolution (~10%), as well as good timing resolution (~400 ps), and DOI resolution (~ 3 mm) and high system sensitivity. A full characterization study for the two modules and imaging studies for both the Derenzo and Hoffman brain phantoms will address the current limitations of human brain PET scanners, and will serve as the foundation for a new dynamic PET scanner for neuroimaging. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop a novel design for detector modules used in brain-dedicated PET system with good spatial resolution, energy resolution, timing resolution, and DOI resolution, as well as high sensitivity. If successful, the study will pave the way for building a novel PET system for greatly improved dynamic PET imaging of the human brain.",High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging,9802309,R01EB028337,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Crystallization', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Film', 'Foundations', 'Gamma Rays', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurotransmitter Receptor', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Portugal', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Production', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Thinness', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'base', 'brain size', 'cost', 'design', 'detector', 'human imaging', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'millimeter', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'photomultiplier', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'response', 'retinal rods']",NIBIB,"CANON MEDICAL RESEARCH USA, INC.",R01,2019,293568,0.023061019213166153
"MR Fingerprinting for Epilepsy Abstract Epilepsy affects 65 million people worldwide; approximately 30% of them do not respond to medications but can be cured by surgery. Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a major pathology for medically intractable epilepsies, is frequently missed by visual analysis of the conventional MRI, making surgical treatment very difficult. We propose to develop a novel quantitative MRI acquisition and analysis framework specific for epilepsy patients, which could provide more sensitive and specific measures of brain structure, thereby improving FCD detection and subtype prediction. To this end, the quantitative framework will be developed and validated in three steps: (1) Develop high-resolution Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) scan that allows simultaneous quantification of multiple tissue property maps efficiently, accurately and precisely. These quantitative maps have shown to be more sensitive and specific on detecting and characterizing subtle signal abnormalities. (2) Develop image post-processing methods to analyze quantitative maps, which will provide quantitative measurements that highlight additional morphological features, such as gray-white boundary blurring, abnormal cortical thickness and folding. (3) Develop machine-learning-based feature screening and prediction tools to characterize group-level features differentiating FCD subtypes, and predict individual-level FCD location and subtyping. Because detection and subtype prediction of FCD are both associated with seizure outcomes, epileptologists can use this tool to provide more personalized and customized counseling. The result of our proposed work promises a paradigm shift by converting the current standard-care of visual/qualitative MRI review to a quantitative framework, including data acquisition, post-processing and decision support tool, that would eventually lead to better treatment planning, reduction in unnecessary pre-surgical evaluation tests (especially invasive evaluation), and improved post-operative seizure outcomes in patients with devastating and disabling medically intractable epilepsy. The quantitative nature of our acquisition/analysis methods also makes it possible to be uniformly adopted by other centers with high consistency.

"In-vivo MRI-based prediction of TDP43 pathology in aging ABSTRACT Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology, a primary protein abnormality in the rare diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, is now recognized as a common age-related neuropathology, detected at autopsy in approximately 50% of older persons. According to recent evidence, TDP43 pathology in aging is associated with more rapid cognitive decline and higher odds of dementia, above and beyond contributions from Alzheimer’s and other age-related neuropathologies. In spite of its high frequency and deleterious effects, TDP43 can only be diagnosed at autopsy, and there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging. The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging by combining multimodal MRI and pathology in the same older persons from large community cohorts. Specifically, we propose to a) train TDP43 classifiers using machine learning based on ex- vivo MRI measurements of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical brain characteristics of older persons, b) translate these classifiers in-vivo, and c) test them in-vivo using longitudinal clinical, in-vivo MRI, and pathology data on older adults enrolled without dementia. We have generated a unique ex-vivo and in-vivo multimodal MRI-pathology database within the infrastructure of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG17917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), two longitudinal, epidemiologic clinical- pathologic cohort studies of aging that recruit non-demented individuals and have high follow-up rates and high autopsy rates. Using our database, we have produced compelling preliminary results in support of our aims. First, we have demonstrated that ex-vivo brain MRI data can be linked to in-vivo MRI data. Second, we show that TDP43 pathology is related to specific brain MRI characteristics independent of other age-related pathologies. Third, we show high TDP43 classification performance (AUC=0.81) based on ex-vivo MRI features in persons with as well as without comorbid Alzheimer’s pathology (a common coexisting pathology). Fourth, we demonstrate that the confidence score obtained from ex-vivo MRI classification is linked to the progression of deposition of TDP43 pathology (i.e. TDP43 stages). Finally, we translated a preliminary ex-vivo TDP43 classifier for use in-vivo and demonstrated in a small sample that it has high in-vivo classification performance, and is independently associated with lower cognition. We propose to further develop and test this promising in-vivo MRI classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology is now recognized as a common and deleterious age-related neuropathology, however, there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging, and diagnosis is only possible at autopsy. The objective of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in older community- dwelling persons with and without dementia, based on a combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical characteristics of the brain.

"Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calcium scoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in the asymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surrounding the heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due to the absence of robust, automated quantification methods.  We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robust quantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a new integrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in two existing, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, late revascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) and the St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To develop and evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of new computational algorithms for automated quantification of EAT measures; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified EAT features, relative to atherosclerotic plaque burden and measures of obesity, for the prediction of future cardiac events in asymptomatic patients in the EISNER registry and the St. Francis Heart Study; 3) To derive and evaluate a new, integrated risk score—combining standard risk factors, coronary calcium score and EAT measures using machine learning—for the prediction of future cardiac events in the EISNER registry, and further, to additionally evaluate this risk score externally in the St. Francis Heart Study patient cohort.  This work in this proposal will provide a novel, personalized paradigm that will objectively and accurately identify asymptomatic patients undergoing coronary calcium scanning who are at increased risk for future cardiac events, without any additional imaging or risk to the patient. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) CT scanning of the heart for coronary calcium scoring is a simple, widely-used, low-cost test with low radiation dose. Using these scans, the researchers propose to establish automated analysis of fat which surrounds the heart, as well as novel computerized scores that identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack. This new research will allow doctors to better identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to avoid a heart attack or sudden cardiac death.",Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events,9688580,R01HL133616,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational algorithm', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early identification', 'Event', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Institution', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Interleukin-6', 'Language', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Reader', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Visceral fat', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated analysis', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'coronary artery calcium', 'coronary calcium scoring', 'coronary vasculature', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'pericardial sac', 'predictive marker', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'routine imaging', 'sudden cardiac death']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,653101,0.023825428910864244
"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning. Success of the project will overcome the major technical hurdles in the use of MRI in radiation therapy and will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information.

"Automatic SUV Extraction and Biodistribution Analysis of Preclinical PET Preclinical positron emission tomography (PET) plays a significant role in monitoring radiotracer biodistributions for the development of new therapies. The standardized uptake value (SUV) has become one of the most important quantitation measures in PET analysis. However, SUV extraction from PET data hinges on the ability to clearly delineate the organ region-of-interest (ROI) from an anatomical reference. Cross-comparison of different organ SUVs and biodistributions is also cumbersome due to complex registration strategies of each animal with an unknown pose and size. Operator bias and lack of efficient co-registration strategies results in poor data reproducibility, high data variability, low data throughput and prohibits the use of fully-automated data parsing and data analysis for predicting early therapy outcomes with high sensitivity. In Vivo Analytics will directly address these shortcomings by developing InVivoPET. It will be a cloud-based PET data analysis tool, which will enable automatic organ SUV extraction followed by an instantaneous biodistribution analysis. InVivoPET will automatically coregister PET images to the animal’s anatomy and will calculate biodistributions in almost real-time. InVivoPET consists of several parts. First, a Body Conforming Animal Mold (BCAM) enables consistent spatial and longitudinal registration of the animal’s pose and location to the PET data. Second, a statistical mouse atlas based on an Organ Probability Map (OPM) provides a digital and operator-independent organ ROI template. Third, a cloud-based software with a browser-based user interface enables an automatic organ SUV extraction with following biodistribution analysis. Last, machine learning and data mining algorithms can be applied in the future that will further enhance study outcomes. InVivoPET does not rely on manual delineation of organs. A machine-driven data analysis fully eliminates operator-dependent variability and increases data reproducibility. It will enable the drug development team to quantitate the impact of candidate therapeutics with the highest accuracy, reduces the time to enter clinical trials, reduces costs, and ensures the quantification and consistency of PET data. Therefore, the hypothesis is that the organ SUV can automatically be extracted from PET data using the BCAM and OPM. In Aim 1, we will modify the BCAM for housing mice with surface-protruding tumors and confirm the ability for spatially aligning mice with tumor xenografts to the OPM. In Aim 2, we will perform PET imaging of tumor bearing mice using 18F-FDG and confirm the ability for automatically extracting the organ SUV based on the OPM. The successful completion of the proposed project will help to commercialize InVivoPET, which will be sold as a plug-in to existing PET systems and as a PET- manufacturer independent Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). Project Narrative: InVivo Analytics seeks funding for demonstrating the feasibility of automatically analyzing radiotracer biodistributions of small animal positron emission tomography (PET). Biodistribution analysis is currently operator-dependent, time-consuming, and prone to error while reducing the reproducibility of study results.

"In Vivo Mapping of Uncharted Functional Units of Tongue Motion During Speech Project Summary Tongue cancer and the treatments used to cure the disease such as glossectomy can have debilitating effects on speech and swallowing, yet not much is known about the relationship between tongue movements in speech and reconstruction choices after cancer resection. The tongue’s vital role in speaking and swallowing is executed by a uniquely complex array of muscles which deform locally into functional units. Tongue movements are governed by synergistic activation of these functional units using orthogonally oriented muscle fibers not a rigid skeletal structure. Functional units, which are regions of 3D coherent motion, are the structures that link low-level muscle activity to high-level surface tongue geometry. This link, the organization of functional units, can provide considerable insight into normal motor control and adapted tongue motion, as in patients who have had surgery for tongue cancer. However, there is poor understanding of the details of how muscle morphology contributes to function due to tongue muscle interdigitation and complex local activation. A key to understanding the relationship between the structure and function of the tongue is to identify functional units of motion in localized tongue regions and map them to muscle anatomy. A large step in this direction can be gained by developing a tool to cluster 3D coherent motion patterns from tagged MRI, and register them to muscle anatomy from high-resolution MRI. Speech motor control is a critical area of importance where platform tools for machine learning techniques are lacking. The goal of this project is to create a framework to relate the functional units to tongue muscle anatomy. This framework will enhance tongue motion analysis in medical research and clinical applications, where MRI is frequently used. To address this goal, we have already developed technologies to analyze high-resolution and tagged-MRI. The first is a detailed 3D muscle atlas based on 3D high-resolution MRI, which depicts the locations of both extrinsic and intrinsic muscles, and will be registered to each speaker to identify and track their muscles in the 3D tagged data sets. The second is software to derive 3D displacement and strain fields from tagged MR images. These displacements, strains, and derived quantities will be used to extract spatio-temporal feature vectors that define coherent regions, which will be verified with simulation. The vectors will then be input into a novel computational method using a NMF and clustering, the goal of which is to establish the functional units of speech. In addition, biomechanical simulations will be used to co-validate our findings. The concept of functional units is at the core of the proposed work, as it can provide insights into tongue muscle coordination in patients after glossectomy surgery. The research plan comprises two specific aims: (1) develop a computational method to establish functional units from MRI and (2) determine the relationship between alterations in anatomy and alterations in functional unit motion after tongue cancer treatment. Linking the functional units to the anatomy will allow the design of more focused treatments and therapies for tongue motion-related disorders. Project Narrative Functions of the tongue—speaking, eating, and breathing—are executed by using a complex muscular array to create global motions (synergies) by deforming local functional units which are intermediate structures that link muscle activity to surface tongue geometry. This project will develop new computational tools that will enable researchers and clinicians to determine the functional units of specific motions and relate them to the muscle anatomy. Such a breakthrough will dramatically improve our knowledge of the mechanisms of muscle coordination, thereby permitting improvement of diagnosis and treatment of tongue motion-related disorders.",In Vivo Mapping of Uncharted Functional Units of Tongue Motion During Speech,9636557,R21DC016047,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Bone structure', 'Breathing', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Elements', 'Excision', 'Geometry', 'Gestures', 'Glossectomy', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Fibers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Therapy', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Extracts', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Treatment-Related Cancer', 'Unit of Measure', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical application', 'computational basis', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'digital', 'functional independence', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'malignant tongue neoplasm', 'motor control', 'multidimensional data', 'muscular structure', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predict clinical outcome', 'reconstruction', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'synergism', 'theories', 'tool', 'vector']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2019,210725,-0.036969858568490055
"Systems biology modeling of radiation resistance and chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma Tumor resistance to radiation therapy remains a significant obstacle to long-term cancer patient survival, especially for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a cancer type with poor long-term outcomes (less than 50% advanced stage five-year survival). To overcome the problem of radiation resistance, radiation therapy is being combined with radiation-sensitizing chemotherapies. Prediction of an individual’s sensitivity to radiation and specific chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies prior to treatment would improve the development of personalized treatment plans for cancer patients. Efforts are being made to create systems biology models of cancer cells for biomarker discovery and prediction of treatment response; however, due to methodological shortcomings, failure to integrate multi-omic data on a genome-scale, and lack of specificity to individual patient tumors, these predictive models have yet to be implemented clinically. To address these needs, the objective of this project is to develop a personalized systems biology modeling platform for individualized prediction of HNSCC patient tumor response to radiation and chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies. These models will be created by first integrating comprehensive biological data on individual patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). This approach will allow for the comparison of metabolic, signaling, and phenotypic signatures between radiation-sensitive and radiation-resistant patient tumors. By then integrating the mechanisms of action of radiation therapy and radiation-sensitizing chemotherapies into the modeling framework, the response to particular chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies in individual radiation- resistant patient tumors can be predicted. Machine learning classifiers will be developed from TCGA patient data and model predictions to determine which biological and clinical factors are most predictive of radiation sensitivity and chemotherapy-radiation combination therapy success. It is hypothesized that differential response to chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies in radiation-resistant HNSCC tumors is accomplished through redox metabolism and signaling, and components of redox biology within the modeling framework will significantly enrich the list of predictive biomarkers for combination therapy success. Although the focus of this project will be on HNSCC, this systems biology modeling approach will be applicable to any cancer type. The outcomes of this project will be a reduced set of clinically-measurable biomarkers for accurate prediction of HNSCC patient response to radiation therapy and specific chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies, as well as a precision medicine platform to test clinically relevant therapeutic strategies. This project is innovative because it combines multi-omic cancer patient data with state-of-the-art systems biology modeling techniques to investigate the biological mechanisms of radiation resistance, as well as to predict chemotherapy-radiation combination therapy response in individual radiation-resistant patients. Combination therapies that include both radiation and chemotherapy are currently being developed for cancer patients that do not respond well to radiation therapy alone. This research will provide insights into why particular head and neck cancer patients do not respond well to radiation therapy, as well as predict which chemotherapy- radiation combination treatments will be most effective for individual patients. Findings from this research will improve our ability to develop personalized treatment plans for cancer patients, which will decrease healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes.",Systems biology modeling of radiation resistance and chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,9676052,F30CA224968,"['Address', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human papilloma virus infection', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Measurable', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mutation', 'NADP', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Cancer Model', 'Predictive Value', 'Prior Therapy', 'Production', 'RNA Interference', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Tobacco use', 'beta-Lapachone', 'biomarker discovery', 'cancer cell', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically relevant', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'radiation resistance', 'radiation response', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'success', 'transcription factor', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NCI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F30,2019,45081,0.008246262205613808
"Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification Project Abstract Motivation: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 500 million people. Children commonly develop CKD from urinary obstructive diseases and nephrotoxic therapies, and then suffer severe growth failure,  hypertension, cardiovascular risks, and neurocognitive deficits, and eventually end-stage kidney disease. Accurate renal function quantification will improve clinical management of hydronephrosis (1 in 100 babies) and  dosing/selection of chemotherapeutic regimens in oncology patients. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the biomarker of renal function, is derived from blood or urine tests. These tests only provide global GFR and are limited in accuracy, especially in children, and even more so in children with cancer. MRI offers superb anatomic delineation without ionizing radiation, and is thus ideal for pediatric kidney imaging. However, MRI has not been widely adopted for pediatric renal function evaluation due to lack of reliability and cumbersome workflow. These hurdles stem from the fact that the critical components required for global and regional GFR calculation, including high spatiotemporal resolution, plasma flow and arterial input function, are difficult to obtain, and that accurate image segmentation of kidneys (cortex and medulla) is labor intensive. Additionally, although the same contrast agent injection can be used for obstruction evaluation, certain areas of the kidney suffer from significant signal loss using standard MRI acquisition techniques due to high contrast agent concentrations. This project addresses these major challenges for automated comprehensive renal function evaluation in children. Approach: The project has three development aims, which are validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable novel free-breathing time-resolved 3D dynamic contrast enhanced MRI that simultaneously provides accurate GFR calculation and renal plasma flow. This is achieved by incorporating self-navigated motion compensation, fast acquisition with parallel imaging and compressed sensing, and phase-contrast flow imaging. The second aim is to develop multiple new image analysis methods to extract GFR and renal plasma flow (RPF) that  leverage novel flow data of Aim 1, as well as automated new machine-learning image processing techniques for the segmentation of kidneys and ultimately global and regional GFR calculation. In Aim 3, we will develop and integrate ultrashort-echo-time techniques to address the MRI signal loss due to T2* effects from high contrast concentration for patients with obstruction, and further incorporate motion compensation and accelerated  imaging methods to enable time-resolved high-resolution dynamic MRI for contrast washout kinetics analysis in the same MR exam. Aim 4 will determine the performance of these methods in a clinical setting. Significance: This work will lead to robust, automated comprehensive pediatric renal MRI for safer and more accurate renal function evaluation in children. The techniques will facilitate widespread application in the com- munity setting and permit robust evaluation of renal function, for both children and adults. Project Narrative Kidney diseases in children often stem from blockages of the urinary tract or toxicity from medications, such as antibiotics or chemotherapies. Kidney function quantification is crucial for clinical management of these children. This work will develop accurate and automated pediatric MRI for quantification of kidney function and diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction.",Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification,9677647,R01EB026136,"['3-Dimensional', '4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac Output', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Cone', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Hydronephrosis', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Obstruction', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Reflux', 'Regimen', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Renal Plasma Flow', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Urinary tract', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Venous', 'Work', 'antimicrobial drug', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'community setting', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast enhanced', 'data acquisition', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'kidney cortex', 'kidney imaging', 'loss of function', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'pressure', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem', 'urinary', 'urinary tract obstruction', 'urologic']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,665614,-0.0017644539216463931
"Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology using 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography Each year, 735,000 Americans have an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), and approximately 120,000 die from it. Heart attacks occur most commonly due to rupture of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries. Despite this, current diagnostic and treatment algorithms make no allowance for the assessment of disease activity and currently all patients with atherosclerosis are treated in a similar manner. This failure to differentiate stable from active disease may result in potentially unnecessary or insufficient therapies. In a breakthrough series of studies, our co-investigators discovered that positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-sodium- fluoride (18F-NaF; an inexpensive and widely available tracer approved by Food and Drug Administration) can readily identify plaque rupture and increased coronary plaque activity. We propose to build further on this success, by addressing several important remaining limitations that prevent us from translating this technology to broad clinical use. The limitations include complicated and subjective image analysis, underutilization of the concomitant coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) for plaque characterization, inability to utilize prior CTA for the analysis of 18F-NaF PET, lack of methods to integrate all available PET and CTA data and significant motion of the coronaries during the PET scan. We propose a multi-faceted approach to automate and improve coronary 18F-NaF PET imaging by full integration with CTA and correction for cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion. The overall goal of the proposal is to optimize the measurement of disease activity in coronary atherosclerosis using integrated 18F-NaF PET/CTA imaging, with the opportunity to validate this development against clinical outcome in a “real-world” multicenter patient study. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: 1) to integrate quantification of CTA and PET image data 2) to develop new methods for simultaneous correction of cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion for coronary PET, and 3) to clinically evaluate new methods in a multicenter clinical trial (separately funded and already underway), further refining risk prediction for heart attacks with integrated PET+CTA risk score derived by machine learning. This work will lead to a robust and reproducible clinical method for stratification of patients for risk of heart attacks, with potential to be applied for the identification of patients who would most benefit from expensive, and potentially risky treatments. Our techniques could also be used in future clinical trials to test the efficacy of novel therapies. Moreover, the new analysis will be applicable to other PET tracers that may be developed to investigate other pathological processes in the coronary vasculature. The resulting software will be shared with clinical institutions performing coronary PET to facilitate standardization and automation of this novel plaque imaging technique. NARRATIVE A heart attack, a major cause of death, is most commonly caused by rupture of deposits in heart vessels, leading to sudden blockage of the blood flow in the vessels and disruption of blood supply to the heart muscle. Currently there is no reliable test to identify deposits at the highest risk of rupture, but in a recent scientific breakthrough, positron emission tomography has demonstrated capability to image disease activity inside these deposits, linked to their rupture; this technique, however, is currently hampered by lack of anatomical reference, image blurring due to heart motion, and variability of manual analysis. We propose to address these problems by developing automatic software that precisely integrates anatomical and biological information and virtually “freezes” vessel motion, validating this new approach in a large “real-world” multicenter patient study.",Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography,9755492,R01HL135557,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Blood flow', 'Breast Microcalcification', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Failure', 'Fluorides', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammation', 'Institution', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Translating', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'atherosclerotic plaque rupture', 'automated analysis', 'coronary computed tomography angiography', 'coronary plaque', 'coronary vasculature', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'heart motion', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'success', 'uptake', 'virtual']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,756169,0.06703833209830713
"Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect, affecting 1.2% of all live births. Imaging plays a major role in managing CHD but remains challenging for evaluating complex cardiac and vascular abnormalities across a wide range of age and habitus. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed cardiovascular 4D flow MRI which can measure complex 3D blood flow in-vivo, a task difficult or impossible to obtain with other imaging strategies. Recent efforts have focused on two forms of CHD: 1) bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) which is the most common form of CHD, and 2) single ventricle physiology (SVP), one of the most severe forms of CHD. Our 4D flow MRI studies have successfully identified new hemodynamic biomarkers to better characterize CHD. We were the first to establish a physiologic link between aberrant 3D blood flow, elevated wall shear stress (WSS), aortopathy phenotype, and aortic wall tissue degeneration on histopathology in patients with BAV. In patients with SVP, our findings demonstrated relationships between surgical correction strategies and flow distribution to the lungs, a known factor implicated in SVP outcome. We have achieved successful clinical translation at Northwestern, where 4D flow MRI is now used as a clinical tool in diagnostic MRI exams for patients with CHD and aortic disease. Over the past four years, the PIs have assembled one of the largest 4D MRI databases with over 2500 patient exams. For this renewal application, we identified a need to increase the dynamic range of 4D MRI flow sensitivity to account for data complexity (3D + time) and the wide age range in CHD by a combination of dual-venc flow encoding, compressed sensing, and SSFP imaging. Second, three is a need for longitudinal studies to identify predictors of BAV and SVP outcome. Third, making these unique but complex 4D MRI data sets and analysis tools more widely available to the greater research community is challenging. In addition, no automated methods currently exist for advanced processing such as atlas based analysis across large cohorts. Analysis is thus time consuming and requires manual interactions (e.g. 3D vessel segmentation) which limits reproducibility and translation. To address this need, an established Northwestern data archival and pipeline processing resource based on remote high-performance computing clusters (NUNDA) will be utilized for standardized data archival, sharing, and pipeline processing of 4D MRI data. This platform will provide the unique opportunity to utilize annotated data available in the 4D MRI database (>1300 BAV, SVP, and control 4D MRI data analyzed in the initial funding cycle) for application of machine learning concepts to establish (semi-)automated 4D MRI analysis workflows in NUNDA. Thus, the renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop a rapid (15 min) non-contrast 4D MRI for clinical translation, 2) leverage the existing large 4D MRI database to identify 4D MRI metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) CHD patient outcome, and 3) establish a remote NUNDA platform for 4D MRI data sharing and automated analysis across large cohorts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop non-contrast 4D MRI, a new diagnostic test to achieve an improved assessment for the most common and one of the most severe forms of congenital heart disease: bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. We will leverage an existing large 4D MRI database to allow for long-term 5-8-year follow-up to establish new measures for improved outcome prediction and therapy management for patients with bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. A comprehensive data archive will be established to allow for the dissemination of the 4D MRI data, analysis tools, and study results to the greater research community.",Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease,9663985,R01HL115828,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Acceleration', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Aortic Diseases', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Common Ventricle', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Rate', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Oxygen', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Secure', 'Sex Differences', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'adverse outcome', 'analysis pipeline', 'aortic valve', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'clinical translation', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data archive', 'data pipeline', 'data sharing', 'design', 'exercise capacity', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'prevent', 'shear stress', 'spatiotemporal', 'tissue degeneration', 'tool', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,740572,0.06535072083215461
"Automatic quantification of myocardial motion in older adults Abstract  Heart failure (HF) is a common condition that represents the end stage of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) subsequent to progressing myocardial damage or ischemia. In populations at ages 65 and older, coronary artery disease (CAD) serves as the leading cause of HF. Although low left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) is a major evidence for the diagnosis of HF in clinical practice, impaired regional myocardial dysfunction is expected to present the existence of CAD in its early stage.  Heart deformation analysis (HDA) is a cutting-edge myocardial motion analysis technique that is able to automatically track the myocardium borders on time frames and calculate global and regional cardiac functional and motional indices on existing cine images without extra scans. In the present study, we will use the HDA tool to analyze existing cine images of CHARISMA study. From 2009 to 2012, cardiac MRI exams (including coronary wall imaging and cine MRI at two-chamber, four-chamber and short-axis views) and concurrent tests for traditional cardiovascular risk factors were performed on 440 older participants (age: 65 - 84 years old at the time of MRI scans) without documented history of CVDs. During the present R03 project (2019-2021), CHARISMA participants would have been followed-up for 10 - 12 years. We plan to relate newly- acquired regional myocardial motion indices (displacement, velocity, strain and strain rate) to clinical outcomes, existing coronary wall measures and results of lab tests in CHARISMA datasets. We will test the overall hypothesis that regional myocardial motion indices have the potential to present cardiovascular risk in asymptomatic elderly. Three specific aims are: 1) Predict cardiovascular events using baseline regional myocardial motion indices; 2) Relate regional myocardial motion indices to MRI-derived features of coronary remodeling; and 3) Determine correlations between regional myocardial motion indices and traditional cardiovascular risk biomarkers/conditions collected in CHARISMA study.  No new MRI scans or lab tests are required in this project. Through a cost-effective approach, the immediate objective of the proposed project is to evaluate the clinical value of regional myocardial motion for cardiovascular risk stratification in asymptomatic older adults, a major target population of cardiovascular prevention. This study will also help us better understand the correlations between impaired myocardial function/motion and subclinical CAD burden. Furthermore, the results will facilitate the selection of quantitative imaging biomarkers and their optimal cut-off points for predicting cardiovascular events in future clinical studies. Project Narrative  In the present study, we will use heart deformation analysis (HDA) to reanalyze existing cardiac MRI data of CHARISMA study.

"Hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT: A new paradigm for image guidance in liver SBRT ABSTRACT This proposal aims to establish a hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT system for precision image guidance in radiation therapy of liver cancer. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) improves the treatment outcome over conventional fractionated radiotherapy by delivering high fractional dose in few fractions. However, SBRT of liver cancer still has high local failure rate up to 20-30% at 2-3 years and high overall grade>=3 toxicity rate up to 30% with patient deaths from the treatment. Previous studies demonstrated a strong correlation between the treatment outcome and the tumor localization accuracy of the image guidance technique used. Currently, cone beam CT (CBCT) is the most widely used imaging technique for liver SBRT. However, CBCT has extremely limited soft tissue contrast with no visualization of most liver tumors. As a result, its localization error is frequently over 6mm, and the dose coverage of tumor volume can fall below 90%, which is far from enough for tumor control. Drastically reducing localization errors is imperative to improve the outcome of liver SBRT. Combined MRI-Radiotherapy machines could provide MRI contrast for liver tumor localization. However, such machines are rare and expensive for most clinics. As such, an alternative solution is urgently required to meet the ubiquitous need of all radiation oncology departments: a solution in the form of a novel low-cost imaging system with MRI equivalent contrast. Since CBCT is readily available on most radiotherapy machines, creating CBCT-based imaging systems would be the most effective strategy. Our recent publication demonstrated the feasibility of such strategy. (Harris, Med Phys 2018) Our long-term goal is to establish the next generation of CBCT systems with virtual multi-modality imaging capabilities for high precision tumor localization and adaptive therapy in radiation therapy. In this application, our overall objective is to establish a novel system to generate hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT from CBCT, with virtual-MRI inside the liver for target localization and augmented CBCT outside the liver for healthy tissue verification. The specific aims are: (1). Establish a 3D hybrid virtual- MRI/CBCT system for image guidance in breath-hold liver SBRT without respiratory motion. (2). Establish a 4D hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT system for image guidance in free-breathing liver SBRT with respiratory motion. (3). Optimize and clinically evaluate the systems through simulation studies and a prospective clinical trial. Our expected deliverables through the academic-industrial partnership are novel hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT systems ready to be integrated to all radiotherapy machines with only CBCT systems. This new imaging capability will have significant clinical impact because it will create a paradigm shift in image-guided radiation therapy by revolutionizing the widely used CBCT systems to enable a new era of low-cost high-precision virtual multi- modality guided radiotherapy. This precision guidance can lead to breakthrough in escalating the tumor control and minimizing the toxicities of liver SBRT as well as treatments of other sites with tumors in the soft tissue. Project Narrative The hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT system will be a low-cost imaging system with superb soft tissue contrast to provide precise image guidance for liver SBRT, which paves the road to further margin reduction and dose escalation. As a result, this novel system has a great potential to enhance the tumor local control and reduce the normal tissue toxicities for all patients under liver SBRT treatments. Finally yet importantly, the hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT system can also be potentially applicable for improving the image guidance precision of radiation therapy treatments of other clinical sites with tumors in the soft tissue, such as breast and prostate cancers.",Hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT: A new paradigm for image guidance in liver SBRT,9801976,R01EB028324,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Breathing', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Financial compensation', 'Fractionated radiotherapy', 'Goals', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Patients', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation therapy', 'Residual state', 'Site', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Volume', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'clinically significant', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'falls', 'image guided', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'multimodality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'oncology', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'recursive neural network', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,553348,0.011139810644815382
"Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop a framework for high-performance parallel transmission (pTx) that is trans- ferable to a wide range of MRI scanners, and apply it to push the spatial encoding limits of echo planar imaging (EPI) at 7 Tesla. EPI is by far the most widely used pulse sequence for rapid functional, diffusion, and perfusion imaging, and has been the focus of considerable development in recent years to increase its speed and spatial resolution. Now there is a strong desire to push EPI's spatial resolution down to the micro scale. For functional MRI (fMRI), this would enable imaging of ﬁne structures (layers, columns, and nuclei) of cortical and subcortical architecture while better resolving the hemodynamic response. For diffusion MRI (dMRI), micro scale EPI would improve surface and laminar analysis of ﬁbers in the cortex, as well as brain parcelation using fractional anisotropy differences between gray matter regions, while broadly reducing partial volume effects. It would further enable EPI to be broadly applied to accelerate anatomic scans that are geometrically matched to fMRI and dMRI scans. However, increasing the resolution of single-shot EPI requires longer readouts which extend echo times and re- duce functional contrast in fMRI and signal-to-noise in dMRI at 7 Tesla, while increasing geometric distortions and blurring. Segmented or multishot EPI is a classic method to increase spatial resolution without increasing readout durations, but is underutilized, primarily due to its high sensitivity to motion and dynamic phase changes between shots which cause large image artifacts.  We propose to develop a new multishot EPI technique called shuttered EPI, which addresses the lim- itations of conventional multishot EPI by imaging a set of spatially disjoint shutters in each shot. The shutters are produced by a multidimensional excitation pulse and are spatially shifted between shots to cover an entire slice. However, with thin slices the length of the excitation pulses are impractical (20-100 ms). Many-coil pTx (> 8 coils) can shorten the length of these pulses to feasible durations, but current 7 Tesla scanners have only 8 transmit channels due to cost, footprint, cabling, and other constraints. In the ﬁrst project period we pioneered a technique called array-compressed pTx (acpTx) which overcomes this limitation. Using acpTx, 8 transmit chan- nels can control an arbitrarily large number of coils, where the channels and coils are connected via an array compression network that is optimized with RF pulses for speciﬁc excitations. In this project, we will develop and apply acpTx methods and hardware (a many-coil head transmit array and an 8 channel-to-many coil array com- pression network) to achieve feasible RF pulse durations when exciting the shutter patterns required for shuttered EPI. These developments will be implemented on two major 7T scanner platforms and evaluated in submillimeter (600 micron) fMRI and dMRI acquisitions. Overall, the project encompasses the synergistic design of RF pulses, hardware, acquisitions and reconstructions to achieve a major advance in spatial encoding. Project Narrative Diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 7 Tesla ﬁeld strength using echo planar imaging (EPI) has the potential to deliver clear images of brain structure and function at the level of layers, columns, and nuclei. However, when existing EPI scans are pushed to the spatial resolutions required to resolve these structures, they become highly sensitive to off resonance-induced geometric distortions, relaxation-induced blur- ring, physiological noise and motion. To address this problem, in this project we will develop many-coil array- compressed parallel transmission and apply it to enable shuttered multishot EPI scans that are robust to these effects.",Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T,9669022,R01EB016695,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Homebound Persons', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Length', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Problem Formulations', 'Relaxation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cost', 'design', 'gray matter', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'motion sensitivity', 'neuroimaging', 'perfusion imaging', 'phase change', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'simulation', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'time use', 'transmission process', 'virtual']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,569563,0.01540194934256546
"Quantitative Renal Imaging for Kidney Diseases Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Angiography (CEMRA) with gadolinium (Gd) provides high resolution visualization of the vascular compartment, but is rarely used in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73m2) due to the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). There is thus an unmet need to develop MRI techniques that can both replace Gd and provide new insights into the etiology and severity of CKD.  PI Sridhar and his team at Northeastern University (NEU) have developed a new technique, Quantitative Ultra-short Time-to-Echo Contrast-Enhanced (QUTE-CE) MRI, leads to quantifiable positive contrast images of the vasculature with unprecedented clarity and definition. QUTE-CE is particularly optimal using Ferumoxytol (Feraheme), an FDA approved iron-oxide nanopharmaceutical, that is already routinely used for iron-deficient anemia therapy in CKD patients. Under an ongoing clinical trial (NCT03266848) we have demonstrated QUTE- CE MRI for renal and cerebral imaging in humans at 3T.  This R21 project will develop the QUTE-CE MRI method for kidney imaging in patients with both normal kidney function as well as with CKD. We propose to scan 25 total patients (10 in Year 1 and 15 in Year 2) who are already scheduled to receive ferumoxytol infusion for iron-deficiency anemia therapy. The specific aims of this project are summarized below. Specific Aim 1: Renal Vascular Angiograms of CKD Patients. These studies will be conducted at NEU and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) using Siemens Prisma MRI scanners. Three tasks will be pursued to develop the optimizing protocol. Task 1: Develop a robust QUTE-CE imaging protocol. Task 2: Implement a robust methodology for accounting for B1 inhomogeneity. Task 3: Develop a robust trajectory for improved image reconstruction including motion correction. We hypothesize that QUTE-CE MRI will lead to high resolution angiograms that will allow for the safe diagnosis of existing pathologies such as renal artery stenosis in addition to the novel identification of kidney micro-vascular disease. Specific Aim 2: Obtain quantitative renal blood volume (RBV) maps and develop machine learning algorithms (MLA) to better understand the severity of kidney disease. The renal angiograms will be analyzed to obtain renal blood volume (RBV) maps. The RBV maps will be analyzed in terms of Machine-Learning algorithms (MLA) to explore whether we can identify common etiologies of CKD as well as estimate the severity of kidney disease. The MLA will enable organ segmentation, automatized renal parenchyma volumetry, as well as automated extraction and labeling of lesions. The MLA results will be compared with radiological scoring, estimated GFR, and degree of albuminuria. We hypothesize that the absolute RBV maps will enable quantitative monitoring of blood volume in cortex and medulla, and that RBV could be a surrogate parameter for renal microvascular rarefaction, a central mechanism in CKD initiation and progression. PROJECT NARRATIVE TITLE: Quantitative Renal Imaging for Kidney Disease This project will develop a quantitative magnetic resonance imaging technique QUTE-CE MRI for studies of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The QUTE-CE MRI methodology provides very clear and high resolution angiographic images of vasculature using a safe and clinically approved nanoparticle contrast agent, that will transform standard of care by enabling diagnostic imaging for a large population of patients with CKD who cannot be imaged with the current gadolinium contrast agent due to its toxicity.",Quantitative Renal Imaging for Kidney Diseases,9824779,R21DK118449,"['Accounting', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'Anemia', 'Angiography', 'Arteries', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood Volume', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Cyst', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Etiology', 'FDA approved', 'Gadolinium', 'Gaussian model', 'General Hospitals', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Infusion procedures', 'Iodine', 'Iron', 'Iron deficiency anemia', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic nanoparticles', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis\xa0', 'Nephrology', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Proteinuria', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Toxicity', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Renal Artery Stenosis', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Severities', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Veins', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'clinical imaging', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'expectation', 'ferumoxytol', 'high risk', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrument', 'iron oxide', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney imaging', 'kidney vascular structure', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanodrug', 'nanoparticle', 'novel', 'nuclear imaging', 'patient population', 'prisma', 'prognostic', 'standard of care']",NIDDK,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,220889,0.04522179532164534
"Distinguishing Lipid Subtypes by Amplifying Contrast from J-Coupling Project Summary/Abstract With the global rise in obesity-related diseases and increasing recognition of the role of fat in diseases such as fatty liver, there is growing need for a noninvasive chemical assay of in vivo lipid depots. But the rich chemistry of these molecules is often ignored in MRI, which typically treats fat as a homogeneous proton species because differences in chemical shift and relaxation are difficult to distinguish in a clinical setting. Innovation: This proposal will be the first to use nonuniform echo spacing to generate J-coupling based contrast between chemically different fats. While fat spins often give monotonically decaying signal under a uniformly spaced spin echo train, J-coupling causes nonuniformly spaced spin echo trains to generate complex fingerprints, which distinguish and even quantify fats with otherwise similar MR properties. Significance: The immediate clinical impact will be to demonstrate a novel J-coupling based contrast mechanism in vivo which will contribute to a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish the 25% of the population with benign steatosis from the 2-3% with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The broader significance of this work is that this novel contrast mechanism could revolutionize the study and clinical management of many diseases associated with bioactive lipid subtypes. Approach: The aims are designed to test the hypothesis that nonuniform echo trains (1) can create contrast between different fats, which (2) will contribute to a multiparametric noninvasive protocol to distinguish benign steatosis and NASH. Aim 1 will identify the echo spacing best suited for distinguishing benign steatosis and NASH, first using density matrix simulations based on high resolution spectra of liver fat from animals with each disease, and then using experiments on whole rat livers. In Aim 2, the sequence developed in Aim 1 will be tested in humans with biopsy proven benign steatosis or NASH, along with a suite of standard methods of liver and fat characterization. This metric, and also metrics derived from conventional images, will be tested for the ability to separate these patient groups. In addition, machine learning algorithms will be used to find a metric that combines multiecho intensities with standard MR metrics. This proposal will prove the usefulness of nonuniform echo trains as a new contrast mechanism and yield a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish simple steatosis and NASH. Moreover, this general approach to distinguish fats could ultimately find a broad range of biomedical applications, such as imaging lipid based therapeutics, distinguishing the 4 fatty acids that make up 90% of the adipose stores, or detecting other lipotoxic subtypes. The results of this work will justify a larger scale study to properly validate the sensitivity to different fat species in humans. Project Narrative This proposal will prove the usefulness of nonuniform echo trains both as a new J-coupling based contrast mechanism and as part of a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish simple steatosis (~25% of the population) from patients on the NASHfibrosiscirrhosis trajectory of metabolically induced liver disease (2- 3% of the population). Moreover, this general approach to distinguish fats could ultimately find a broad range of biomedical applications, such as imaging lipid based therapeutics, distinguishing the 4 fatty acids that make up 90% of the adipose stores, or detecting other lipotoxic subtypes.

"Imaging of prostate cancer by combined quantitative ultrasound and acoustic-radiation-force-impulse imaging Project Summary/Abstract Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most-common cancer of men in the United States. The goal of the project is to develop a reliable, imaging tool for characterizing prostate tissue. This tool will improve detection, grading, treatment, and monitoring of PCa. It can be implemented in existing clinical scanners for effective needle-biopsy guidance and for planning and targeting focal therapy. Such a tool would significantly reduce the amount of unnecessary biopsies of noncancerous tissue and the current high rate of false negative diagnoses. It also would allow monitoring diagnosed PCa during watchful waiting or after non-surgical therapies. We propose to investigate the feasibility of fusing acoustic radiation-force impulse (ARFI) imaging and quantitative ultrasound (QUS) for typing prostate tissue. Studies to date have demonstrated encouraging performance of each ultrasonic modality when used alone. However, the ability of the combined modalities has not yet been investigated. The proposed project seeks to extract features from a retrospective data set containing radio-frequency (RF) ultrasound data acquired while performing in vivo prostate ARFI imaging. Images generated from both technologies are intrinsically perfectly registered. We will employ our well-established QUS-processing procedures to extract QUS-parameter maps from the RF-data and will develop and test new algorithms to extend the feature set from our established QUS-processing to incorporate ARFI image features. We will use standard and new features from QUS and ARFI for training linear and non-linear classifiers (e.g. support vector machines) to identify and image PCa. We will compare the performance of classifiers trained with QUS alone, ARFI alone, and MRI alone. Furthermore, we will assess performance improvement if classifiers are trained based on QUS- ARFI, QUS-MRI, ARFI-MRI, and QUS-ARFI-MRI parameter combinations and will determine the best classifier to detect prostate cancerous tissue using cross-validation and receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) statistics. If this project is successful, subsequent projects will focus on integrating the newly developed tools into clinical scanners. Project Narrative We propose to assess the feasibility of a novel tool for imaging and detection of prostate cancer (PCa) that combines quantitative ultrasound and acoustic radiation-force imaging. If our proposed method proves to be feasible and ultimately is successful, it will have a major impact on clinical practice by reducing the current high rates of false-negative diagnoses of PCa and by enabling non-invasive, low-risk, low-cost monitoring of PCa.",Imaging of prostate cancer by combined quantitative ultrasound and acoustic-radiation-force-impulse imaging,9737939,R03EB026233,"['Acoustics', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlas of Cancer Mortality in the United States', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancerous', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Intercept', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Prostate', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Publishing', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Relaxation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Screening for Prostate Cancer', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer classification', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'male', 'men', 'novel', 'patient population', 'quantitative ultrasound', 'radio frequency', 'routine imaging', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIBIB,RIVERSIDE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2019,78801,0.018018274632534886
"Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI Project Abstract Motivation: This is a competing renewal of our successful project, Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI, R01 EB009690. MRI offers superb soft tissue contrast for children, without the ionizing radiation and cancer risk of CT. However, MRI use has been limited due to long exams, low spatial resolution, and motion-artifacts. Thus, MRI often requires prolonged anesthesia with breath-holds and attendant risk; hence, children often lack the beneﬁts of cross-sectional imaging altogether or are exposed to ionizing radiation. The previous project addressed these concerns by creating a dedicated pediatric imaging system. Highly par- allel, high-SNR 3T receive coil arrays were designed and constructed speciﬁcally for pediatric body imaging. The high SNR was used to accelerate scans reconstructed with a combination of parallel imaging, new mo- tion correction algorithms, compressed sensing (CS), and higher dimensional imaging. The resulting system is now being used extensively in clinical practice, signiﬁcantly reducing anesthesia depth and duration, and has markedly increased our MRI utilization. Key technologies have been or are now being commercialized with GE Healthcare, including the pediatric receive array, CS, 4D ﬂow, full-Fourier single-shot T2-weighted scanning, and coil compression. Siemens has licensed ﬁve of our patents, implemented them in work-in-progress packages, and productized our coil compression and our ESPIRiT coil sensitivity estimation. Philips has licensed three of our patents. This ensures broad impact. Approach: Despite signiﬁcant progress and reduced anesthesia depth and duration, patient cooperation re- mains the main limitation to eliminate anesthesia in all pediatric body MRI exams. Many children will cooperate for several minutes, but then ﬁdget and get out of the scanner. Others are content until acoustic noise agi- tates them. Therefore the major emphasis now is greater exam execution speed, comprehensive elimination of acoustic noise, and increased robustness, particularly to contrast agent injection. The project has three interrelated development aims, validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable fast 2D imag- ing for quiet T2 and quiet low-distortion diffusion weighted imaging. A second aim is to develop free-breathing 3D contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted imaging that is silent and motion-robust. The third aim will enable au- tomated, smart scanning to speed the exam execution and adaptive protocols to increase the exam robustness. The impact of all of these developments in the clinic will then be assessed to assess the resulting reduction of anesthesia. Signiﬁcance: This work will lead to fast, robust, broadly-applicable pediatric MRI protocols with less anes- thesia, making MRI safer, cheaper, and more available to children. MRI will be transformed into a workhorse modality, reducing CT radiation burden. The techniques will facilitate wide application in the community setting and permit new MRI applications, for both pediatric and adult diseases. Project Narrative Pediatric MRI often requires anesthesia. After considerable progress reducing the depth and duration of anes- thesia, this work aims to reduce the frequency of anesthesia through a synergistic combination of fast, quiet, motion-robust, automated, and adaptive scanning. This will make MRI safer, cheaper, and more widely available to children, reducing the population risk of radiation from CT.",Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI,9754130,R01EB009690,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Body part', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Breathing', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational Technique', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Image Compression', 'Image Enhancement', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Legal patent', 'Letters', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatrics', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Speed', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'community setting', 'compliance behavior', 'contrast enhanced', 'design and construction', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'patient tolerability', 'pediatric patients', 'programs', 'radiation risk', 'reconstruction', 'skills', 'soft tissue', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,683589,0.03236336348752323
"Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT With the introduction of many novel techniques to minimize radiation dose in CT, there is still a large variation in terms of radiation dose levels prescribed in CT exams and therefore a large variation of diagnostic performance. Some patients may receive higher dose than necessary. Some may be under-dosed and mis- diagnosed as a result of insufficient image quality. In order to determine the appropriate amount of radiation dose reduction in each exam, accurate quantification of diagnostic performance is needed so that the dose reduction can be achieved without sacrificing important diagnostic information. However, currently there is a lack of efficient and quantitative tools for objective assessment of diagnostic performance, particularly for many of the novel dose reduction methods involving non-linear processing of the data such as iterative reconstruction and deep-learning-based noise reduction methods. The specific goal of this application is to disseminate a highly automated solution, CT Protocol optimization (CTPro) software, to a wide CT community. This quantitative tool provides an efficient implementation of diagnostic performance assessment and CT radiation dose optimization. This tool is based on channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), which itself was developed decades ago to mimic human observer visual responses in signal detection tasks. However, the use of CHO in clinical CT is quite limited because of a lack of rigorous validation and efficient and robust implementation in practice. We were the first to demonstrate its correlation with human observer performance in low-contrast detection, classification and localization tasks in clinical CT. The main objective of the current proposal is to optimize this tool for simplicity and robustness, and disseminate it to CT researchers and clinical users, which will be accomplished through 3 specific aims: Aim 1: Optimize CTPro for simplicity, robustness, and generalizability. Aim 2: Develop an open-source web-based platform for software dissemination. Aim 3: Build use cases and disseminate CTPro. The proposed work is significant because the software tool will allow any CT users and researchers to perform CT radiation dose optimization and diagnostic performance evaluation in an efficient, quantitative, and objective manner. This work is innovative in that the automated tool will use quantitative measures of diagnostic performance to systematically guide the complex task of CT dose optimization, moving beyond traditional metrics that are inappropriate for many novel dose reduction techniques. The software tool, once widely employed, will facilitate a paradigm shift in how dose optimization and the evaluation of dose reduction techniques are performed, and will allow a more rapid and consistent adoption of dose reduction technology into clinical practice, which will benefit millions of CT patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a lack of quantitative tools for efficient and objective assessment of diagnostic performance in CT, which is the reason why inappropriate radiation dose is frequently used in CT exams, resulting in unnecessarily high radiation exposure to patients or lose of important diagnostic information. The purpose of this project is to disseminate a highly automated solution to a wide CT community for efficient CT radiation dose optimization. If successful, appropriate amount of radiation can be prescribed for millions of CT patients at any facility, while maintaining the level of diagnostic information required for high quality patient care.",Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment,9881453,U24EB028936,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Encapsulated', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Newsletter', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computerized data processing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'open source', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'symposium', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'web site']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U24,2019,397500,0.04762028850363819
"Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of disability worldwide. The inability of non-invasive techniques to quantify disease progression has limited understanding of the pathogenesis of OA. While numerous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods have been proposed for imaging OA, sensitivity to bone metabolism has been limited. We propose to develop advanced three-dimensional PET-MRI methods for bone and soft tissue metabolism to study the response of the tissues in the joint to changes in knee load. This work will lead to a new understanding of OA pathogenesis by revealing relationships between changes in cartilage and bone metabolism over time. This project aims to develop PET-MRI methods to sensitively track changes of OA in response to biomechanical loading. Our specific aims are to (1) Develop accurate, reproducible and dose-optimized kinetic models of dynamic 18F-NaF PET-MRI for quantitative bilateral whole joint imaging using deep learning and advanced MR coil technology, (2) Study the relationship between resting state bone metabolism and biomechanics using PET- MRI and (3) Perform a longitudinal study to assess the response of our new imaging methods to changes in joint biomechanics from gait retraining. The innovation of this work lies in the development of novel imaging techniques that simultaneously offer quantitative measures of tissue physiology in cartilage and bone using PET-MRI. The significance of this work is that we will be able to sensitively and quantitatively track changes in bone metabolism and soft tissue microstructure due to changes in biomechanical loading in the knee joint over time. This will provide new and more sensitive imaging tools to assess the responses of the joint to biomechanical interventions to treat OA such as gait retraining, bracing, or high tibial osteotomy. Narrative Osteoarthritis affects more than half of the population during their lives and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Diagnostic imaging of osteoarthritis is often limited to x-ray, but more sensitive and specific imaging is a critical need for assessment of disease-modifying treatments such as bracing or gait modification. This work aims to develop novel 3D imaging approaches using positron-emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to quantitatively assess joint health during mechanical treatment of osteoarthritis. !",Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis,9817807,R01AR074492,"['Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Arthralgia', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Matrix', 'Bone Spur', 'Bone Tissue', 'Bone remodeling', 'Cartilage', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Fluoride Ion', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medial', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Needs Assessment', 'Orthopedics', 'Osteotomy', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sclerosis', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone', 'bone metabolism', 'cartilage metabolism', 'clinical translation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'gait examination', 'gait retraining', 'imaging approach', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'joint loading', 'mechanical force', 'mechanical properties', 'mineralization', 'molecular marker', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiotracer', 'response', 'soft tissue', 'subchondral bone', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'uptake']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,561592,0.0686235469510643
"Combined Cardiopulmonary Failure in COPD: SPIROMICS HF The death rate and hospitalizations from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have doubled in the last 50 years. A third of COPD hospitalizations overlap with heart failure, mostly with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), yet no large COPD study has ascertained cardiac function. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) COPD Study was funded to test the endothelial hypothesis of emphysema and examine reduced RV dimensions (“cor pulmonale parvus”) in COPD. In the MESA COPD Study II, we found that associations of reduced pulmonary microvascular blood flow with emphysema do not appear to be confounded by hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and that emphysema on CT predicted RV regression over 5 years. We also developed methods to further subtype emphysema and COPD and scaled them up to the SubPopulations and InteRmediate Outcome Measures In COPD Study (SPIROMICS). We used unsupervised machine learning to discover new emphysema subtypes that are common and have molecular origins. Separately, we found that 26% of adults have segmental airway variants, which are associated with COPD and the developmental genes FGF10 and RARA. Both genes affect right heart development. In pilot work, we found one dramatically altered RV strain and the other associated with cor pulmonale parvus. Finally, we found that bronchitic ‘symptomatic smokers,’ who have hyperinflation from gas trapping, may have increased LV diastolic dysfunction. Hence, cardiac alterations in COPD are complex but recent advances in COPD subtyping may allow their personalized diagnosis and treatment. SPIROMICS is an NHLBI-funded prospective study that recruited smokers with COPD and controls and is re-examining 2,000 participants with gold- standard lung phenotyping including full-lung CT. We propose to add comprehensive echocardiography (echo) with speckle-tracking for cardiac mechanics for 1,000 SPIROMICS participants, with exercise in 700 and cardiopulmonary MRI in 600, to test the following hypotheses: 1) machine-learned subtypes of emphysema on CT are associated with specific alterations in cardiac structure and function, which vary from cor pulmonale to LV diastolic dysfunction; 2) participants with segmental airway variants have abnormal RV structure and function; 3) symptomatic smokers have signs of increased LV afterload and LV diastolic dysfunction. Innovative aspects of the application include the use of novel echo and MRI measures in a large, well- characterized cohort of COPD patients. Confirmation of the hypotheses would define the mechanisms of HFpEF in COPD and identify subsets of patients for targeted treatment of cardiopulmonary dysfunction. The death rate and hospitalizations from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have doubled in the last 50 years. A third of COPD hospitalizations overlap with heart failure, mostly with preserved ejection fraction. The proposed study would be the first large study with gold-standard phenotyping of the heart and lungs and would test highly specific hypothesized based upon recent advances in lung subphenotyping to yield personalized approaches to combined cardiopulmonary disease in COPD.",Combined Cardiopulmonary Failure in COPD: SPIROMICS HF,9819260,R01HL093081,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Apical', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DRD1 gene', 'Death Rate', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Drops', 'EFRAC', 'Echocardiography', 'Endothelium', 'Exercise', 'FGF10 gene', 'Failure', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gases', 'Genes', 'Gold', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypoxia', 'Impairment', 'Kinetics', 'Lung', 'Lung CAT Scan', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Myocardial', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Pulmonary Heart Disease', 'Pulmonary artery structure', 'RARA gene', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Right Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Right ventricular structure', 'Sampling', 'Smoker', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiogenesis', 'cohort', 'disorder control', 'disorder subtype', 'genetic variant', 'heart function', 'heart preservation', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'patient subsets', 'personalized approach', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'receptor', 'recruit', 'targeted treatment', 'unsupervised learning', 'vasoconstriction']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,2391491,-0.02417781856898381
"Development and Dissemination of Clinical CEST MRI Acquisition and Analysis Methods for Cancer Imaging Applications This research plan will continue our development of Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI acquisition and analysis methods for imaging patients with cancer. AcidoCEST MRI with an exogenous contrast agent is an innovative variation of this technique that measures extracellular pH in solid tumors. We have also developed an exceptionally innovative method that acquires endogenous CEST MR images with multiple powers, which can measure the chemical exchange rate of endogenous proteins that can assess relative differences in pH. We will improve our CEST MRI acquisition methods by accelerating the imaging speed, reducing and eliminating complications due to patient motion, eliminating complications caused by fat signal, and expanding to 3D imaging methods. We will also improve image analysis methods that are required for CEST contrast from endogenous proteins and exogenous contrast agents.  Our research has strong impact because acidoCEST MRI can track changes in tumor acidosis in response to chemotherapy and chemoradiation therapy in patients who have breast cancer and head & neck cancer. Endogenous CEST MRI can improve the diagnoses of brain tumor recurrence vs. pseudoprogression, and evaluations of lung cancer vs. lung infection. We will perform clinical studies with our endogenous and exogenous CEST MRI methods to image patients with brain, breast, lung, and head & neck cancers.  To amplify the impact of our research, we will develop versions of our CEST MRI acquisition methods for the many versions of the 13 Siemens hardware platforms and software operating systems at the MD Anderson Cancer Center. We will also develop user-friendly CEST analysis methods for many researchers at MD Anderson. We will leverage our unique research environment and expertise with intra-institutional dissemination to provide inter-institutional dissemination, by sharing share these acquisition and analysis tools with other CEST MRI researchers. We will collaborate with NIST to provide the first CEST MRI phantom that can standardize the development and implementation of intra- and inter-institutional CEST MRI methods.  Our team of outstanding investigators includes experts in CEST saturation methods, CEST MR image analysis, clinical contrast agents, rapid MRI acquisition methods, high field 7T MRI, clinical radiology, biostatistics, histopathology and oncology. Based on our expertise and years of productivity in clinical CEST MRI, we have developed an exceptional research approach. As the world's largest cancer center and a health destination, the MD Anderson Cancer Center has the patient population that provides very strong institutional support for our clinical studies. NARRATIVE We will develop new acquisition and analysis methods that assess tumor acidosis with CEST MRI, using exogenous CEST agents and endogenous sources of CEST contrast. We will apply our new methods to evaluate tumor acidosis in patients with breast, head & neck, lung, and brain cancers.

"Personalized dosimetry for liver cancer radioembolization using fluid dynamics simulation Project Summary/ Abstract Liver cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths with rising incidence in the U.S and worldwide. Yttrium-90 microspheres radioembolization, or Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT), is a treatment in which a catheter inserted in the patient's hepatic artery delivers radioactive 90Y microspheres to the liver. It is increasingly utilized to treat patients with unresectable liver tumors in second or third line, but some of its potential to improve overall survival is still untapped. The major obstacle in making SIRT more efficient is the treatment planning. It consists in selecting the 90Y activity to inject based on the estimated dose to the tumor and organs-at-risk. The problem is that the dose calculation is highly unreliable and does not include important parameters, such as well-known non-uniformities or the injection point. As a result, physicians often choose very conservative dosage to limit toxicity at the expense of the tumor(s) dose, which drastically reduces SIRT efficacy. The objective of this project is to develop accurate patient-specific dosimetry for SIRT planning. We propose a novel method combining computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate the 90Y microsphere 3D distribution and 90Y physics modeling to predict the absorbed dose. The central and novel approach is to carry out the CFD simulations for each patient's hepatic arterial tree to achieve high accuracy and precision, because anatomical features determining the microsphere distribution present wide variations across the patient population and prohibit the use of generic models. This novel CFD-based dosimetry will be the first comprehensive tool to integrate (1) the hepatic arterial tree extracted from the patient's standard-of-care angiogram, (2) CFD simulation in this hepatic arterial tree to predict and optimize the microsphere distribution, (3) calculation of the absorbed dose with 90Y physics modeling. Our long-term goal is developing a tool that can be integrated in clinical workflow to optimize the quantity and injection point of 90Y microspheres during SIRT planning. To this end, we will pursue two specific aims. (1) We will develop the CFD model and dose calculation using a pig model for validation; (2) we will develop a deep learning approach to simultaneously segment the hepatic artery from the standard-of-care patient angiograms and conduct a morphometric study of the obtained hepatic arterial trees to identify the principal parameters affecting the model. If successful, this project will generate a reliable, patient-specific dosimetry for SIRT providing a comprehensive calculation of the absorbed dose in individual lesions as well as in the healthy liver. This will enable high precision treatment planning to better treat the tumors with a “dose-painting” approach and ultimately improve long-term patient outcome. Narrative Liver cancer is one the most prevalent type of cancer with deadly outcome in the U.S. and worldwide. It is increasingly treated with selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) but due to severe limitations in treatment planning and dose calculation in particular, the efficacy of SIRT is drastically reduced. This work addresses this central issue by developing new dosimetry to personalize treatment planning for each patient, with the ultimate goal of improving liver cancer long-term patient outcome.",Personalized dosimetry for liver cancer radioembolization using fluid dynamics simulation,9723557,R21CA237686,"['3-Dimensional', '90Y', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Albumins', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Convolution Kernel', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distal', 'Doppler Ultrasound', 'Dose', 'Family suidae', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatic artery', 'Human', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Lesion', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radioactive', 'Radioembolization', 'Radioisotopes', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Radionuclide therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Tracer', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Trees', 'Unresectable', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer type', 'clinical implementation', 'computerized tools', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dosage', 'dosimetry', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'internal radiation', 'morphometry', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglect', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'research clinical testing', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2019,201430,-0.002884512444804643
"Phase 1 cross over biodistribution study of [203Pb]VMT01 for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and [68Ga]VMT02 for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of stage 4 melanoma SIGNIFICANCE: Melanoma incidence is rising faster than any other cancer and metastatic melanoma is typically fatal. Responses to targeted and immunotherapies can be remarkable, but low response rates, acquired resistance, and adverse side effects limit long-term quality of life for these patients. The overall response rate to all therapies remains dismally near 50% and the 5-year survival is <25%. Preclinical studies have identified radiolabeled peptides that target the melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R) as a potential therapeutic alternative. While this approach using -particle emitters has been largely ineffective preclinically, previous publications and our Phase I data have demonstrated efficacy of Viewpoint’s MC1R-targeted VMT01 -particle therapy in mice bearing melanoma tumors. Thus, VMT01 is designed to meet the significant unmet medical need to improve outcomes for these patients (initial indication of progressive stage 4 metastatic melanoma), with potential for expanded indications in combination with FDA-approved melanoma drugs (e.g., immunotherapies). In this revised Phase II SBIR project, Viewpoint will complete a Phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial to determine the safety of its companion diagnostics. It is further expected that the company will have gained a preliminary understanding of the effectiveness of [68Ga]VMT02 imaging (PET) to identify MC1R positive tumors and the utility of [203Pb]VMT01 imaging (SPECT) for performing patient dosimetry for personalized [212Pb]VMT01 -therapy. PREDICATE PHASE I MILESTONES include: efficacy (therapy and imaging) in mice; pharm/tox of lead VMT01; automated radiopharmaceutical production with GMP kits; exclusive licenses to IP; clinical consortium with Mayo Clinic and 203Pb supply with Lantheus Medical Imaging; CRO for statistics/clinical data (Compleware, Inc.); and a radiopharmacy partner (Hotshots Nuclear Medicine) for manufacturing/distribution of [203Pb]VMT01. EQUITY INVESTMENTS: Viewpoint has secured $650,000 in equity investment to establish manufacturing of 212Pb generators for future clinical therapy trials. The company will complete the following Aims toward its goals. AIM 1. Secure FDA “safe to proceed” designation to conduct the Phase 1 imaging trial of [203Pb]VMT01 and [68Ga]VMT02 under IND. AIM 2. Complete a Phase 1 safety and biodistribution study of [203Pb]VMT01 and [68Ga]VMT02 imaging in human subjects and demonstrate their utility for identifying MC1R positive tumors and performing patient-specific dosimetry. OUTCOMES: We expect to demonstrate the clinical safety of [203Pb]VMT01 and [68Ga]VMT02. We further expect to develop preliminary understanding of the efficacy of [68Ga]VMT02 PET/CT to identify MC1R+ tumors and the utility of [203Pb]VMT01 SPECT/CT for patient-specific dosimetry for [212Pb]VMT01 -therapy. Thus, we will be prepared to initiate dosimetry-based trials of [212Pb]VMT01 -particle therapy for metastatic melanoma to be funded under Phase IIB SBIR studies and Phase III equity investments. This project aims to complete a Phase 1 trial of companion diagnostics that would be used for patient selection and dosimetry for an radionuclide therapy for metastatic melanoma.

"Multiband ASL for Neurodevelopment Study Project Summary/Abstract The developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood is marked by a mix of potential and vulnerability. A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during this critical period, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and the first signs of emotional disorders. It is important to understand detailed patterns of typical development, so alterations can be identified and rectified as early as possible. As an entirely noninvasive and quantitative imaging method, arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI is increasingly being recognized as an important biomarker for functional brain development in both healthy populations and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, there remain significant challenges for making ASL an impactful tool in studying neurodevelopment, including: 1) a coarse spatial resolution of ~4x4x4mm3, 2) susceptibility to head motion with segmented 3D acquisitions, and 3) potential confounding effects of age dependent variations in arterial transit time using a single post-labeling delay (PLD) scan. Simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) or multiband (MB) is a new accelerated imaging technology that simultaneously excites multiple slices and recovers each slice with parallel imaging techniques. Preliminary studies combining MB with ASL showed that MB can reduce T1 relaxation of the label, improve spatial coverage and/or resolution compared to those of standard 2D ASL. MB imaging may also overcome the limitation of 3D ASL acquisitions in terms of head motion and spatial blurring. However, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of existing MB ASL is inferior to that of 3D ASL. This project builds on two recent innovations from our lab: 1) a constrained slice-dependent (CSD) background suppression (BS) technique that improves the SNR of 2D MB pCASL to be comparable to that of 3D pCASL; and 2) a single-shot 3D GRASE pCASL method with 2D CAIPIRINHA accelerations that improves the imaging speed of 3D pCASL. The goal of this R01 project is to develop and evaluate cutting-edge MB pCASL protocols that are able to offer a high spatial resolution of isotropic 2mm or higher, resistance to head motion and multi-delay capability for accurate perfusion quantification in pediatric populations. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based denoising algorithm for multi-delay MB pCASL will be further developed. The developed suite of MB pCASL protocol and post- processing algorithms will be evaluated in 40 typically developing children and adolescents. The successful completion of this R01 project will lead to a robust multi-delay MB pCASL protocol that is highly valuable as potential biomarker for both neurodevelopment research and pediatric clinical care. To maximize the scientific and clinical impact, we will continue disseminating the pulse sequence and associated post-processing software as we have been doing in the past decade. Relevance to Public Health A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during the developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and emotional disorders.

"3-D Imaging Flow Cytometry PROJECT SUMMARY This project aims to develop and test two innovative platforms and related software for 3-D imaging flow cytometry of fluorescent or absorbing (stained) samples. These systems will allow 3-D structural and functional imaging of many single cells at a subcellular resolution and at a scale that used to be available only in flow cytometry or recently in 2-D imaging. Thereby, the proposed methods have the potential to fundamentally change the ways cultured cells, patient-derived samples, and small experimental organisms are studied. Automated classification based on the 3-D features will enable the diagnosis of hematologic disorders at single-cell precision. Existing 3-D microscopy methods can provide the same information at higher resolution; however, by relying on a scanning mechanism they cannot be applied to suspending cells, especially in a flow configuration, which is essential for high-speed interrogation. Snapshot 3-D microscopy techniques have been developed to address this challenge, but they have insufficient spatial resolution for single-cell imaging and suffer from long data processing time. We overcome these limitations by combining two novel snapshot techniques developed by the PI with the most rigorous optical imaging theories and cutting-edge component technologies. We will use an array of lenslets, which simultaneously records many projection images corresponding with different viewing angles. The use of pupil phase masks, designed using wavefront coding and a theory of 3-D high-numerical-aperture optical imaging, will increase the resolution of each projection image to the theoretical limit given by the objective-lens numerical aperture. The target resolution is 0.5 µm, which is comparable to existing 2-D imaging flow cytometry systems. The target imaging throughputs based on current component technologies are 120 volumes/sec for fluorescence imaging and 700 volumes/sec for absorption imaging, which are higher than 100 volumes/sec of cutting-edge 3-D optical microscopy for stationary specimens. The vast amount of data acquired by these 3-D imaging systems imposes a serious challenge to data processing. The developed systems record true projection images, which obviate iterative deconvolution process, thereby allowing much faster tomographic reconstruction than in existing snapshot techniques. Using general-purpose graphics processing units and optical diffraction tomography, which includes the diffraction of light by subcellular organelles, our tomographic reconstruction algorithm will be faster yet more accurate than existing approaches. Further, we will explore the feasibility of applying a deep convolutional neural network to the images acquired by the developed systems for accurate single-cell classification based on 3-D features. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to develop 3-D imaging flow cytometry platforms for fluorescent or absorbing (stained) cells at high resolution and high throughput in a flow configuration.

"Quantitative Low-Dose PET Imaging Project summary Quantitative PET has become increasingly important in clinical management and research, in particular for predicting and assessing response to therapy for cancer patients. Current PET protocols involve injection of PET tracers that typically result in ~6-7 mSv radiation dose to patients. For patients who require multiple repeated PET scans to monitor the response to therapy, and for patients who need PET scans with two or more tracers (e.g., FDG + FLT) to optimally predict response to therapy, it is critical to reduce the radiation dose from the PET tracer injection, while still maintaining the quantitative accuracy and image quality for cancer management. When reducing injection dose, the PET images will have higher noise due to fewer detected counts, which will subsequently introduce errors in quantitative measurements. For moving organs and tumors such as those in the lung and abdomen, respiratory motion can substantially degrade quantitative accuracy, so motion correction is required. Conventional motion correction uses a gating strategy that rebins the PET data, resulting in substantially higher noise in each gate. More advanced methods incorporate motion vector estimation in the image domain for post-registration or motion compensated image reconstruction using all detected events without increasing noise. The motion vectors need to be derived from gated PET, which are even noisier when using a reduced tracer injection in low-dose studies, imposing substantial challenges for accurate and reliable voxel-by-voxel motion vector estimation. In dynamic PET studies with clinical cardiac tracers and other novel oncology and neurology tracers, quantification is even more challenging for low-dose PET as each dynamic frame only contains a small fraction of detected events so the high image noise will affect the determination of image-derived input functions and can lead to bias and high noise in parametric images. In this project, to reduce image noise and maintain quantitative accuracy in PET, we propose to develop, optimize, and evaluate multiple innovative imaging methods for low-dose PET data to achieve comparable quantitative accuracy as full-dose PET. While the imaging developments are generally applicable to all PET tracers in oncology, neurology, and cardiology, since cancer is the primary clinical application of PET, we will focus our investigation and optimization in this project on three lung cancer imaging tracers at different clinical adoption stages as examples: 1) 18F-FDG as a routine clinical tracer, 2) 18F-FMISO for hypoxia studies as a tracer for human research, and 3) 18F-PD-L1 that specifically binds to human PD-L1 in tumors and other organs as a recent first-in-human tracer.

"Quantitative Low-Dose PET Imaging Project summary Quantitative PET has become increasingly important in clinical management and research, in particular for predicting and assessing response to therapy for cancer patients. Current PET protocols involve injection of PET tracers that typically result in ~6-7 mSv radiation dose to patients. For patients who require multiple repeated PET scans to monitor the response to therapy, and for patients who need PET scans with two or more tracers (e.g., FDG + FLT) to optimally predict response to therapy, it is critical to reduce the radiation dose from the PET tracer injection, while still maintaining the quantitative accuracy and image quality for cancer management. When reducing injection dose, the PET images will have higher noise due to fewer detected counts, which will subsequently introduce errors in quantitative measurements. For moving organs and tumors such as those in the lung and abdomen, respiratory motion can substantially degrade quantitative accuracy, so motion correction is required. Conventional motion correction uses a gating strategy that rebins the PET data, resulting in substantially higher noise in each gate. More advanced methods incorporate motion vector estimation in the image domain for post-registration or motion compensated image reconstruction using all detected events without increasing noise. The motion vectors need to be derived from gated PET, which are even noisier when using a reduced tracer injection in low-dose studies, imposing substantial challenges for accurate and reliable voxel-by-voxel motion vector estimation. In dynamic PET studies with clinical cardiac tracers and other novel oncology and neurology tracers, quantification is even more challenging for low-dose PET as each dynamic frame only contains a small fraction of detected events so the high image noise will affect the determination of image-derived input functions and can lead to bias and high noise in parametric images.

"Deep learning techniques for time-of-flight PET detectors Project Summary/Abstract One of the key advances in modern positron emission tomography (PET) systems for clinical imaging is the use of time-of-flight (TOF) information. In cancer imaging TOF provides superior lesion detection and more accurate quantification that is crucial in measuring response to therapy, as well as in neurological and cardiovascular imaging applications. An additional benefit of TOF is the ability to lower the radiation dose or scan time without sacrificing image quality, important for patient safety and comfort. The magnitude of these clinical benefits is determined by the TOF resolution of the PET detectors, therefore the prospect of achieving unprecedented image quality and clinical imaging capabilities with superior TOF resolution has fueled significant research in developing detector technology for TOF-PET systems. However, these developments have been largely unaccompanied by advances in signal processing methods needed to extract TOF information from the detector’s electrical signals, with most detectors making use of crude analog algorithms that discard most of the useful timing information contained in the signals. Now, with the availability of low-cost fast waveform digitizers, there is an exciting opportunity to implement sophisticated digital signal processing algorithms to achieve superior TOF resolution. The main advantage of developing advanced signal processing algorithms is that it presents a cost-effective route to improved TOF resolution that is complementary to instrumentation innovations. In essence, the TOF gain comes for free; the detector signals already contain the information needed for better TOF resolution, it just needs to be used effectively. Here we propose to tailor deep learning techniques to estimate TOF from the detector signals. Deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is a powerful approach to learn complex representations of input data that can be used for tasks such as classification and regression. CNNs are therefore very suitable for directly estimating TOF from the detector waveforms, since these waveforms are influenced by several complex and intertwined processes which are hard to accurately model. Furthermore, large amounts of ground truth training data are readily generated. We recently demonstrated the feasibility of CNN-based TOF estimation, and found up to 23% improvement in TOF resolution compared to standard signal processing methods. This proposal aims to optimize these methods to push the limits of achievable TOF resolution and develop methods for their practical implementation. First, we will develop CNN architectures and methods suitable for silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) that are now used in modern TOF-PET systems. We will also optimize the digitizing parameters to make optimal use of CNNs for TOF estimation. Second, we will implement CNN-TOF methods in a modern commercial PET detector, including using a global CNN to simultaneously estimate TOF and the crystal-of-interaction from the detector waveforms, demonstrating the practical feasibility of using this promising deep learning method in next generation PET systems. Narrative The use of time-of-flight information in positron emission tomography (PET) is a powerful way to increase clinical imaging capabilities of PET, and is now used in most modern systems. Improving time-of-flight performance promises to provide substantial benefits for lesion detection in cancer imaging, kinetic modeling with dynamic imaging, and the use of lower radiation dose for patient safety. Here we introduce deep learning signal processing methods to significantly improve the performance of time-of-flight PET detectors without requiring new materials, which thereby represents a cost effective route towards maximizing the use of the rich imaging signal provided by time-of-flight.",Deep learning techniques for time-of-flight PET detectors,9651713,R03EB027268,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Digital Signal Processing', 'Dose', 'Electronics', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human Engineering', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Industry Collaboration', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Photons', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Solid', 'Speed', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tube', 'analog', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'clinical imaging', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'digital', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'learning strategy', 'network architecture', 'next generation', 'patient safety', 'photomultiplier', 'physical process', 'response', 'scale up', 'signal processing', 'time use', 'voltage']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2018,78500,0.04785072862668879
"Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning Cerebrovascular disease remains a common cause of death and major disability in the United States, and identifying and preventing strokes should be a high priority. Direct measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) is challeng- ing in these patients, since we do not have a non-invasive, radiation-free imaging method that has been appropriately validated against gold standard techniques. This is important, because there is compelling evidence that measuring the CBF change before and after a stress test meant to increase CBF (a measurement known as cerebrovascular reserve [CVR]) can identify patients at increased stroke risk. Stress tests have been a mainstay of the diagnostic workup of cardiology patients for many years, and we believe strongly that their use will benefit cerebrovascular disease patients as well. The goal of this project is to improve the quality of arterial spin label (ASL) MRI using deep learning, a powerful form of machine learning, that is currently undergoing tremendous progress. We will then to apply this in a prospective, adaptive validation trial against oxygen-15 water PET CBF, using simultaneous PET/MRI to minimize biological variability. Finally, we will apply this improv- ed tool to study the effects of gender on CVR and its reproducibility. Successful completion of this study will result in a validated methodology to assess CVR in cerebrovascular disease patients without the use of radiation or contrast. As such, it will provide solid, evidence-based recommendations for clinicians developing new paradigms and interventions in patients with impaired CVR. There is strong evidence that imaging of cerebrovascular reserve (CVR), the ability to increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) in response to a challenge, can identify patients at increased risk of stroke. Therefore, measuring CVR would be extremely useful for designing clinical trials of interventions to mitigate this risk. However, current methods to measure CBF and CVR are suboptimal, and do not work well in patients with cerebrovascular disease. The goals of this project are • to improve non-contrast, radiation-free arterial spin label MRI methods  using deep learning, a powerful form of artificial intelligence that has  shown tremendous progress for computer vision • to validate these methods against a CBF gold-standard, oxygen-15 water  PET, using simultaneous PET/MRI, using an adaptive “play-the-winner” strategy • to apply them to assess gender differences in CVR and test their  reproducibility, with the goal of establishing age and gender normative  ranges to better identify outliers.",Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning,9599417,R01EB025220,"['Acetazolamide', 'Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Bypass', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Carotid Stenosis', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consensus', 'Cytolysis', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Excision', 'Gadolinium', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'ImProv', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Japanese Population', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Nutrient', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Premenopause', 'Procedures', 'Radiation', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Spin Labels', 'Stress Tests', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Waste Products', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Xenon', 'base', 'blood flow measurement', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'cerebrovascular', 'cerebrovascular imaging', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'design', 'direct application', 'disability', 'evidence based guidelines', 'gender difference', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning network', 'men', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel strategies', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'response', 'stressor', 'stroke risk', 'systematic review', 'time use', 'tool']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,653337,0.028595673832935632
"Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization Project Summary Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most diagnosed form of non-cutaneous cancer in US men. The selection of patients who require immediate treatment from those suitable for active surveillance currently relies on non- specific and inaccurate measurements. A method that allows clinicians to more confidently discriminate clinically relevant from non-life-threatening tumors is needed to improve patient management. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is the preferred non-invasive imaging modality for characterizing primary PCa. However, its accuracy for detecting clinically significant PCa is variable. We propose to address this limitation by combining mpMRI with positron emission tomography (PET) with a PCa-specific radiotracer and using advanced multimodal machine learning models (i.e. radiomics and deep learning) to characterize tumor aggressiveness based on the imaging data. Recently, scanners capable of simultaneous PET and MR data acquisition in human subjects have become commercially available. An integrated MR-PET scanner is the ideal tool for comparing MR and PET derived image features to identify those that provide complementary information and build a hybrid PET-mpMRI model that most accurately identifies clinically significant tumors. While this novel technology allows the acquisition of perfectly coregistered complementary anatomical, functional and metabolic data in a single imaging session, a new challenge needs to first be addressed to obtain quantitatively accurate PET data. In an integrated MR-PET scanner, the information needed for PET attenuation correction (AC) has to be derived from the MR data and the methods currently available for this task are inadequate for advanced quantitative studies. We have formed an academic-industrial partnership to accelerate the translation of multimodal MR-PET machine learning approaches into PCa research and clinical applications by addressing the AC challenge and validating machine learning models for detecting clinically significant disease against gold standard histopathology in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Specifically, we will: (1) Develop and validate an MR-based approach for obtaining quantitatively accurate PET data. We hypothesize that attenuation maps as accurate as those obtained using a 511 keV transmission source – the true gold standard for PET AC – will be obtained; (2) Identify the multimodal radiomics model that most accurately predicts PCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that the diagnostic accuracy of this approach will be superior to that offered by the stand-alone modalities; (3) Evaluate radiomics and deep learning approaches for predicting pPCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that machine learning approaches will achieve a higher predictive accuracy when applied to data acquired simultaneously than sequentially. Project narrative A better method to non-invasively characterize primary prostate cancer is needed to improve patient management. Extracting additional information from multimodality quantitative MR-PET data using machine learning approaches is expected to result in better diagnostic performance. In this work, we propose to accelerate the translation of quantitative MR-PET to prostate cancer research and clinical applications. In particular, we will develop and validate an MR-based attenuation correction approach to guarantee that quantitatively accurate PET data are obtained in an integrated MR-PET scanner and then use machine learning approaches to characterize the aggressiveness of the tumors in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.",Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization,9524253,R01CA218187,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Death Rates', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Histopathology', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kinetics', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prostate', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone imaging', 'cancer classification', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'men', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'radiotracer', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tumor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,684119,0.05287392526970988
"MRI near Total Joint replacements Project Abstract Overview: The parent project for this supplement aims to provide routine MRI of subjects with total joint replacements by reducing the severe image artifacts near metal, while offering highly efficient patient-specific scans that can detect bone loss, infection, and temperature changes near the implant in clinically feasible scan times. The supplement aims to incorporate deep learning techniques to better meet the parent grant goals. Relevance: Total joint replacements are one of the most successful orthopedic procedures, used annually to reduce pain from joint diseases in about one million patients in the United States (a number projected to double by 2030). However, about 10% of joint replacements fail in 5-10 years due to bone loss (osteolysis), infection, or other complications, often leading to revision surgery. Accurate, early, non-invasive assessment of complications remains limited, but would offer earlier and less invasive treatments, reduce unnecessary surgery, or allow better surgical planning. Approach: Prior to, and during the parent grant period, we have developed novel “multi-spectral imaging” (MSI) MRI techniques that allow visualization of pathology adjacent to metallic implants, and together with other groups have successfully applied them to imaging of patients with devices including joint replacements and spinal fixation hardware. However these methods remain slow, have limited spatial resolution, and are challenging to use routinely. The recent growth of the machine learning field including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and its application to medical imaging offers unique opportunities to substantially improve MRI near metal, and specifically the goals of the parent grant. We propose 3 small, independent aims in the supplement: (1) to bring fast, isotropic imaging near metal to clinical practice by using CNN-based methods to reduce reconstruction times to under 30 seconds, (2) to improve image quality away from metal by using a new reconstruction and CNN to avoid needing standard imaging in addition to MSI methods and (3) to reduce background-gradient induced artifacts near to metal using a CNN-based approach to enable better diagnosis of abnormalities adjacent to metal. Summary: We aim to supplement our parent grant with CNN-based approaches to speed up scanning and image reconstruction, and to improve image quality near to and way from metal. These techniques will allow routine, non-invasive evaluation for earlier and more accurate detection and treatment of complications in these patients, as well as numerous other applications of MRI near metal implants. Project Narrative There is a growing need for accurate diagnosis of complications surrounding joint arthroplasty, where MRI would provide excellent contrast if not for the fact that the presence of metal severely degrades images. Building on recent ideas in MRI and deep learning, we propose to develop practical methods for routine clinical imaging of patients with metal implants by increasing speed as well as offering image contrast that shows infection and other complications near the metal devices. Ultimately these methods will be tested and offered for widespread use to enable earlier and better treatment of complications resulting from arthroplasty, as well as for better understanding of the implications of different devices.",MRI near Total Joint replacements,9750463,R01EB017739,"['Address', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Direct Costs', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Infection', 'Joint repair', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Network-based', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Procedures', 'Osteolysis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Protocols documentation', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Stretching', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'arthropathies', 'bone loss', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'cluster computing', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'field study', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'metallicity', 'novel', 'pain reduction', 'parent grant', 'parent project', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'spectrograph']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,156870,0.02690234674654206
"Synergistic integration of deep learning and regularized image reconstruction for positron emission tomography Project Summary/Abstract Positron emission tomography (PET) is a high-sensitivity molecular imaging modality widely used in oncology, neurology, and cardiology, with the ability to observe molecular-level activities inside a living body through the injection of specific radioactive tracers. In addition to the commonly used F-18-FDG, new tracers are being constantly developed and investigated to pinpoint specific pathways in various diseases. New PET scanners are also being proposed by exploiting time of flight (TOF) information, enabling depth of interaction capability, and extending the solid angle coverage. To realize the full potential of the new PET tracers and scanners, there is an increasing need for the development of advanced image reconstruction methods. This grant application proposes a new framework for regularized image reconstruction that synergistically integrates deep learning and regularized image reconstruction. The new framework is enabled by the recent advances in machine learning, which provide a tool to digest vast amount information embedded in existing medical images. The proposed method embeds a pre-trained deep neural network in an iterative image reconstruction framework and uses the deep neural network to regularize PET image directly. By training the deep neural network with a large amount of high-quality low-noise PET images, the proposed method can capture complex prior information from existing inter-subject and intra-subject data and thus is expected to substantially outperform the current state-of-the-art regularized image reconstruction method. The two specific aims of this exploratory proposal are (1) to develop the theoretical framework to synergistically integrate deep learning in regularized image reconstruction for PET and (2) to implement the proposed method and validate its effectiveness using existing animal data. Once the proposed method is validated using existing animal data, we will seek funding to acquire necessary human data for the implementation of the proposed method on clinical PET scanners. Project Narrative Positron emission tomography (PET) is a medical imaging technique widely used in clinic for detecting cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological disorders.

"Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This “Pathway to Independence” award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position.

Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET for PET/MR and target delineation for radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from only MR-data. Unfortunately, MRI has limited capability to resolve bone and the inability of most MR acquisitions to distinguish between air and bone makes segmentation of these tissues types challenging. This project will utilize deep learning, a new and growing area of machine learning, to develop new methodology to create substitute CT images from rapid MR acquisitions that can be utilized in PET/MR and radiation treatment planning workflows. In Aim 1 we will study rapid MR acquisitions to be used with deep learning approaches for sCT generation in the head and pelvis using 3T PET/MR images matched with PET/CT imaging to create deep learning training and evaluation datasets. Different deep learning networks and MR inputs will be studied and adapted to determine the best PET reconstruction performance. In Aim 2 we will investigate rapid but motion-resilient approaches to whole- body MR imaging for subsequent deep learning-based substitute CT generation. In an exploratory subaim, we also propose to study methods of sCT generation that only utilize PET-only data. The data acquired in Aim 2 will be used to create comprehensive whole-body, motion-resilient datasets for training and evaluation of deep learning networks. In Aim 3 we will evaluate substitute CT approaches for MR-only radiation treatment planning. MR-only approaches will be compared to standard CT-based treatment simulation in the brain, head & neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and deep learning networks will be optimized and evaluated for region- specific RT planning and simulation. Additionally, transfer learning approaches will be studied to extend sCT to a 0.35T MR-Linac to demonstrate respiratory motion resolved substitute CT generation. This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET in PET/MR and target delineation in radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from MR-only data.

"Left Ventricular Distribution Patterns of the Regionally varying Ischemic Myocardial Contractile Substrates Associated with Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation PROJECT SUMMARY - ABSTRACT  The loss of mitral leaflet coaptation surface area caused by restrictive chordal tethering to dysfunctional myocardial wall segments is the well-recognized mechanism of ischemic mitral regurgitation (MR). An accurate characterization of the left ventricular (LV) distribution pattern, magnitude, and reversibility of the contractile injury substrates that predispose to the occurrence of ischemic MR may improve the accuracy of therapeutic intervention. Only recently have high-resolution LV regional contractile metrics become clinically available to map myocardial ischemic substrates (hibernating, infarcted) across patient-specific LV geometry. Application of MRI-based multiparametric strain analysis in our pilot ischemic MR study group suggested that high-resolution 3D topographical mapping of LV contractile injury may reveal a more complex array of associated regional contractile injury than is discernible from echocardiography. This initial study identified a “sentinel” LV region (basilar and mid subregions of the posterior and posterolateral LV regions) in which the presence of severe contractile injury clearly predisposes to the development of ischemic MR.  We will enroll ischemic coronary artery disease patients with (≥3+ MR; n=90) and without (≤1+ MR; n=90) ischemic MR who are scheduled for standardized surgery (ACC/AHA Clinical Guidelines). Preoperative MRI- based multiparametric strain analysis will provide high-resolution 3D LV topographical maps of regional contractile injury to statistically correlate to occurrence of ischemic MR and to postoperative studies obtained at 3-months and yearly. An independent core laboratory will catalogue all echocardiography-based metrics of ischemic MR for inclusion in Support Vector Machine analyses, along with all other identified clinical variables.  MRI-based LV displacement datasets are obtained in <30 minutes using Navigator-gated Spiral Displacement ENcoding with Stimulated Echoes (DENSE). Patient-specific LV strain fields are calculated using the recently developed Radial Point Interpolation Method (RPIM). Regional contractile function is “normalized” by comparing multiple patient-specific strain metric values (at each of 11,520 LV grid points) to their respective average +/- SD values from our normal human strain database, with z- score (SD) calculation (total computer analysis <20 seconds). Support Vector Machine analyses will search all metric variables (multiparametric strain, echo-based metrics, and all clinical variables) for patterns that predict ischemic MR recurrence.  We will use high-resolution 3D topographical mapping of “normalized” LV contractile function to characterize the distribution, magnitude, and reversibility of the regional contractile injury substrates (hibernating; infarcted) associated with ischemic MR. We will then test the hypothesis that the novel application of machine learning Support Vector Machine analyses can identify hybrid combinations of both regional contractile injury patterns and clinical variables that accurately predict post-repair recurrence of ischemic MR. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Since the loss of mitral leaflet coaptation surface area caused by restrictive chordal tethering to dysfunctional myocardial wall segments is the well-recognized mechanism of ischemic mitral regurgitation, an accurate characterization of the left ventricular distribution pattern, magnitude, and reversibility of the contractile injury substrates (hibernating/infarcted) that predispose to the occurrence of ischemic mitral regurgitation may improve the accuracy of therapeutic intervention. Only recently have high-resolution LV regional contractile metrics become clinically available to map these myocardial ischemic substrates across patient-specific LV geometry. We will test the hypothesis that in patients with ischemic CAD, the ischemic status of a 4-subregion “sentinel” zone (basilar/mid subregions of posterior/posterolateral regions) is the primary determinant of the presence of significant ischemic MR and that three defining ischemic substrate (infarcted, hibernating) characteristics (location, magnitude, and reversibility) can be used in a hybrid model to predict recurrence of ischemic MR.",Left Ventricular Distribution Patterns of the Regionally varying Ischemic Myocardial Contractile Substrates Associated with Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation,9769299,R56HL136619,"['Angiography', 'Anterolateral', 'Area', 'Cardiac', 'Catalogs', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Correlation Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Enrollment', 'Geometry', 'Guidelines', 'Hibernation', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Injury', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Postoperative Period', 'Radial', 'Recovery', 'Recurrence', 'Resolution', 'Schedule', 'Sentinel', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Troponin', 'Ventricular', 'base', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'papillary muscle', 'prognostic', 'repaired', 'response']",NHLBI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R56,2018,389375,0.030452041215641205
"Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Abstract: Fast, reliable and accurate delineation of pelvic organs in the planning and treatment images is a long- standing, important and technically challenging problem. Its solution is highly required for state-of-the-art image-guided radiation therapy planning and treatment, as better treatment decisions rely on timely interpretation of anatomical information in the images. However, automatic segmentation in male pelvic regions is always difficult due to 1) low contrast between prostate and surrounding organs, and 2) possibly disparate shapes/appearances of bladder and rectum caused by tissue deformations. The goal of this project is to create a set of novel machine learning tools to achieve accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (e.g., prostate, bladder, and rectum) in different modalities (e.g., planning CT, treatment CT/CBCT, and MRI) for radiotherapy of prostate cancer.  Planning CT. For automatic segmentation, landmark detection is often the first step in rapidly locating the target organs. Thus, in Aim 1, we will create a novel joint landmark detection approach, based on both random forests and auto-context model, to iteratively detect all landmarks and further coordinate their detection results for achieving more accurate and consistent landmark detection results. After roughly locating organs with the aid of those detected landmarks, the second step is to accurately segment boundaries of target organs in the planning CT. Accordingly, in Aim 2, we will create a set of learning methods to a) first simultaneously predict all pelvic organ boundaries in the planning CT with the regression forests trained by labeled training data, and b) then segment all pelvic organs jointly by deforming their respective shape models. In particular, to address the limitations of conventional deformable models in assuming simple Gaussian distributions for organ shapes, a novel hierarchical sparse shape composition approach will be developed to constrain shape models during deformable segmentation.  Treatment CT/CBCT. During the course of serial radiation treatments, to quantitatively record and monitor the accumulated dose delivered to the patient, organs in the treatment image also need to be segmented. Although methods proposed in Aims 1-2 can be simply applied, as done by many conventional methods, this will lead to a) inconsistent landmark detection and b) inconsistent segmentations across different treatment days because of possible large shape/appearance changes. Accordingly, in Aim 3, we will create a novel self- learning mechanism to gradually learn and incorporate patient-specific information into both joint landmark detection and deformable segmentation steps from the increasingly acquired treatment images of patient. Thus, population data will gradually be replaced by the patient's own data to train personalized models.  MRI. To guide pelvic organ segmentation in the planning CT, MRI is now often acquired for selected patients. To this end, in Aim 4, we will develop a) a prostate MRI segmentation method by using deep learning to learn MRI-specific features for guiding landmark detection and deformable segmentation as proposed in Aims 1-2; b) a novel collaborative MRI and CT segmentation algorithm for more accurate segmentation of planning CT.  All our developed algorithms will be evaluated for their performance in clinical (treatment planning and delivery) workflow for 130 patients in UNC Cancer Hospital and also hospitals of our consultants.  Benefit for Patient Care. Development of these segmentation tools will 1) dramatically accelerate the clinical workflow, 2) reduce workload (i.e., manual interaction time) for physicians, and 3) lead to better patient outcomes with reliable and accurate segmentations of target area and critical organs. Although these tools cannot replace the expertise of physicians, they can be of great assistance to physicians. Narrative Description of Project This project aims to create a set of novel machine learning tools for accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (such as prostate, bladder, and rectum) in various imaging modalities to help radiotherapy of prostate cancer. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel joint landmark detection and boundary prediction framework for accurate segmentation of the planning CT images, 2) an innovative updating mechanism for incorporating patient-specific information from previous treatment images of same patient to progressively improve treatment CT/CBCT segmentation, and 3) a deep-learning based framework for learning MRI-specific features for prostate MRI segmentation, as well as a novel method for collaborative MRI & planning CT segmentation. We will validate these methods on real patients in our clinical workflow. Besides, although these machine-learning tools are designed for radiotherapy of prostate cancer, they can also be easily extended to other new organs and new modalities after appropriate updating and training.",Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment,9527787,R01CA206100,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Hospital', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rectum', 'Sample Size', 'Shapes', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Update', 'Workload', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dosage', 'forest', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'novel', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment duration', 'treatment planning']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,347700,0.0459081079975369
"Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement ABSTRACT This proposal aims to develop deep learning methods to automate the extraction of morphological imaging features relevant to knee osteoarthritis (OA), and total knee replacement. While, quantitative evaluation Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a central role in OA research in the clinical setting MR reports often tend to be subjective, qualitative, and the grading schemes utilized in epidemiological research are not used because they are extraordinarily time consuming and do not lend themselves to the demands of todays changing healthcare scenario. The “Big Data” challenge and opportunity facing us makes it necessary to build enabling tools (i) to automate the extraction of morphological OA imaging features, with the aim of evaluating disease progression prediction capabilities on larger sample sizes that have never been explored before; (ii) to discover latent patterns by uncovering unexplored data-driven imaging features by the application of state of the art deep learning approaches (1); (iii) combine multi-modality imaging with clinical, functional, activity, and other data to define the trajectory of joint degeneration in OA. Leveraging the power of these state of the art techniques, and with the extraordinary availability of a large datasets of annotated images; in this project, we propose to develop an automatic post-processing pipeline able to segment musculoskeletal tissues and identify morphological OA features in Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI), as defined by commonly used MRI grading systems. Automation of morphological grading of the tissues in the joint would be a significant breakthrough in both OA research and clinical practice. It would enable the analysis of large sample sizes, assist the radiologist/clinician in the grading of images, take a relatively short amount of time, reduce cost, and could potentially, improve classification models. The availability of automatic pipelines for the identification of morphological abnormities in MRI would drastically change clinical practice, and include semi-quantitative grades, rather than subjective impressions in radiology clinical reports. In this study, we also aim to develop a complete supervised deep learning approach to obtain data-driven representations as non-linear and semantic aggregation among elementary features able to exploit the latent information hidden in the complexity of a 3D MR images, eliminating the need for nominal grades of selected features. This second aim, while being at high risk has also a potential exceptional high impact; as it departs from the classical hypothesis driven studies, and builds a novel translational platform to revolutionize morphological grading of MR images in research studies, but also is paradigm-shifting in that it may provide a more quantitative feature driven basis for routine radiological clinical reports. The clinical impact of this proposal lies in the third aim (R33 phase), in which we propose to translate the solutions developed in the R61 phase on images in the UCSF clinical archives (PACS), and plan to include also demographic and clinical data in the electronic health records, to build the models defining total knee replacements. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deep learning is revolutionizing medical imaging by solving challenging problems in disease classification, progression and therapeutic response. In this project, we focus on using deep learning methodology on magnetic resonance images of the knee to study osteoarthritis prevalence, and progression. The usage of features derived from the imaging data, rather than established, and often subjective grading schemes, will have significant impact on clinical radiology, establishing quantitative physician assist tools with an ultimate goal of reducing the economic and healthcare burden of total knee replacement.!",Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement,9724174,R61AR073552,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Big Data', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cartilage', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Economics', 'Edema', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Ligaments', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scheme', 'Semantics', 'Subchondral Cyst', 'Supervision', 'Synovitis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'disease classification', 'drug discovery', 'epidemiology study', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'joint destruction', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'learning strategy', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'patient population', 'radiologist', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R61,2018,24598,0.025933589240235387

"30th Annual MR Angiography Meeting Project Summary The objective of the 30th Annual Workshop on Magnetic Resonance Angiography is to provide a forum for scientists and scientist-clinicians, clinical staff and industry interested in MR angiography techniques. The Workshop is the annual meeting of the Society for Magnetic Resonance Angiography (SMRA). At this meeting, emerging techniques and exciting new applications to visualize the vascular system, measure and display blood flow and improve patient outcomes will be presented. MR angiography is an important clinical tool that is applied to millions of patients annually and accounts for an estimated 10% of all MR procedures. Recent advances in time-resolved imaging, non-contrast imaging, post-processing techniques, flow measurements, and flow visualization, as well other innovations, continue to make MRA a dynamic, cutting-edge area of interest for scientific investigation. A major goal of this SMRA Workshop is to provide scientists, clinicians, and students with the opportunity to build connections, pool their knowledge, and educate each other in order to accelerate the refinement of MRA technology and critically how to apply it in clinical practice. Topics for the MRA Workshop will include: vascular disease mechanisms, vessel wall and plaque imaging, quantification of blood flow dynamics, machine learning including deep learning plus `Big Data', vessel lumen imaging, MRA of the brain, heart, abdomen, and extremities; contrast agents, cardiac MR, assessment of cardiac structure & function, clinical study design, new MRA techniques, interventional MRI, MRI of implanted devices, technology assessment, and comparing MRI with other medical imaging modalities. The 3-day workshop will be preceded by an informative one-day educational program that will include both fundamental and advanced lectures from international experts in the field. These topics and educational objectives of the 30th Annual Workshop on Magnetic Resonance Angiography are directly related to the NHLBI mission to provide global leadership for research, training, and education to promote the prevention and treatment of heart and blood diseases. The scientific presentations will include new discoveries about the causes of disease and as such contribute to the translation of basic discoveries into clinical practice. In addition, the proposed educational activities as well as discussion among participants will foster training and mentoring of emerging scientists and physicians. In this context, the workshop will support a collaborative research infrastructure, including participants from academic institutions and industry.

"Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is notoriously difficult to diagnose non-invasively, and current methods of assessing CMD utilize only the peak velocity of the coronary flow pattern. While new imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved the assessment coronary perfusion, there are currently no non-invasive methods that incorporate the coronary flow pattern over a complete cardiac cycle to definitively assess and predict the development of CMD.  Coronary blood flow (CBF) reflects the summation of flow in the coronary microcirculation, and our lab has begun to harness the full CBF pattern under varying flow and disease conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes) to determine whether it might harbor novel clues leading to the early detection of CMD. Our past and preliminary data indicate an early onset of CMD in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that occurs prior to the onset of macrovascular complications and that are characterized by blood flow impairments and alterations in coronary resistance microvessel (CRM) structure, function, and biomechanics. Our data also uncovered innovative correlations between CRM structure/biomechanics and our newly-defined features of the coronary flow pattern, some of which were unique to normal or diabetic mice. We have initially utilized these CBF features, in the presence and absence of other factors such as cardiac function, to develop a mathematical model in collaboration with Drs. Christopher Bartlett and William Ray that to date demonstrated that 6 simple factors can predict a normal vs. diabetic coronary flow pattern with 85% predictive accuracy. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the leading cause of heart disease and is associated with hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMD) is comprised of structural and functional deficits of the tiny coronary arteries that may be an earlier indicator of disease prior to the onset of overt CAD. The proposed multidisciplinary research aims to develop a computational artificial intelligence model that will accurately predict CMD based on a non-invasive coronary flow pattern obtained by Doppler echocardiography.",Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease,9584176,R21EB026518,"['Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic mouse', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doppler Echocardiography', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elements', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperemia', 'Hypertension', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Publications', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'coronary perfusion', 'db/db mouse', 'diabetic', 'disorder prevention', 'early onset', 'experimental study', 'heart function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'macrovascular disease', 'mathematical model', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent']",NIBIB,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R21,2018,190000,0.023197598630972684
"Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI Project Summary/Abstract Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) provides arguably the most comprehensive evaluation of the cardiovascular system; however, respiratory motion continues to adversely impact CMR, causing artifacts that lead to poor image quality, repeated scans, and decreased throughput, and thus represents a significant obstacle to clinical utility. For single-shot CMR, cardiac and breathing motions are “frozen” by limiting the acquisition to an end-diastolic window less than 200 ms. For first pass perfusion, breathing motion cannot be eliminated because data from 50 to 60 consecutive heartbeats are required to capture contrast dynamics. For other single-shot applications such as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and parameter mapping, respiratory motion is introduced when the acquisition is repeated across several heartbeats to improve spatial and temporal resolution. To eliminate respiratory motion from single-shot images, non-rigid motion correction (MOCO) has been promoted as an attractive option that provides 100% acquisition efficiently. MOCO can be used either after the reconstruction or during the reconstruction. Such techniques, however, cannot account for through-plane motion, which can only be corrected prospectively, and can fail depending on image quality and the extent of motion. Prospective compensation of the respiratory motion has been recognized as an attractive alternative to existing gating and MOCO methods. Proposed methods use one or more navigator echoes—incompatible with or inefficient for many CMR protocols—to capture the respiratory motion and rely on simple parametric models that are inadequate to describe complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion. Due to these limitations, prospective methods have found limited applicability even in research settings. We propose a new framework to prospectively compensate respiratory motion. The proposed method, called PROspective Motion compensation using Pilot Tone (PROMPT), employs Pilot Tone technology and leverages machine learning principles to first learn complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion on a patient-specific basis and then prospectively compensate the motion by tracking the imaging plane, in real time, as a function of a Pilot Tone based respiratory signal. If successful, this synergistic combination of Pilot Tone and machine learning will lead to 100% efficiency for single-shot CMR exams performed under free-breathing conditions, will eliminate the need to setup navigator echoes, respiratory bellows, or other inefficient prospective gating measures, will minimize through-plane motion that can render the images non-diagnostic for CMR applications including fast-pass perfusion, parameter mapping, LGE, and coronary angiography, will provide a reliable surrogate measure of respiratory motion, and will facilitate highly accelerated compressive recovery. Project Narrative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has many potential advantages over currently used imaging methods to diagnose heart disease, but MRI images can be ruined if the patient breathes during the scan. In this project, we will develop a method that is insensitive to breathing motion and compare it to existing methods. These efforts should lead to significant improvements in diagnosis of heart disease so that patients may benefit from appropriate treatment.",Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI,9587091,R21EB026657,"['Anatomy', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Freezing', 'Gadolinium', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'healthy volunteer', 'heart motion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,185264,0.06052379567609855
"Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. The goal of this proposal is to develop and provide a new analysis technique for understanding the complex cardiac motion patterns (in time and space) of patients with cardiac dyssynchrony, with the hope of improving its treatment outcomes, specifically with respect to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). CRT, the most effective treatment for dyssynchrony with worsening heart failure, significantly improves outcome in only ~66% of heart failure patients selected for the treatment, which is based on ECG criteria. Selection criteria based on imaging are essential to improving the success rate. Unfortunately, response rates are not higher with selection criteria based on echocardiography, the most popular cardiac imaging technique. Cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has the potential to better characterize dyssynchrony, as it shows cardiac mechanics and intramural wall motion with much higher spatial resolution than echocardiography. However, quantitative assessments of CMR have been mostly limited to global volumetric measures, which ignore most of the motion information captured by the images. For example, studies of a number of distinctive motion features of dyssynchrony (such as septal flash and apical rocking) have been confined to qualitative assessment, limiting inference of their potential utility for improving CRT treatment. To accurately quantify cardiac function through CMR, we have developed biomechanical models for describing cardiac function and machine learning technology for identifying morphological and functional patterns atypical for healthy hearts. We propose to combine these two technologies to accurately quantify cardiac dyssynchrony within the Left Ventricle (LV). Specifically, our methods will extract a rich description of LV motion and strain from the CMRs of a set of retrospectively selected subjects with synchronous or dyssynchronous LV motion. We will then use machine learning methods to identify local and global motion patterns specific to dyssynchrony. Finally, we will correlate these patterns to already existing clinical scores to find potentially predictive markers with respect to CRT outcome. We hypothesize that these markers will have a higher correlation to CRT outcome than current clinical markers alone. Identifying these markers will have the potential to further stratify the disease with respect to the expected outcome of CRT, which then can be used to derive new selection criteria that lead to higher success rates. The project will also disseminate our novel, data-driven methodology for quantifying that motion. Other research groups can apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases impacting LV motion in general. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy, as the current clinical selection criteria are too broad. Our goal is to more accurately characterize the complex shape and motion patterns of cardiac dyssynchrony, through new machine learning technology applied to dynamic cardiovascular magnetic resonance images. We envision that our findings would further improve both our understanding of cardiac dyssynchrony in relation to heart failure and the ability to predict its response to resynchronization therapy, potentially leading to new clinical guidelines and improved clinical outcomes.",Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony,9475862,R01HL127661,"['Apical', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Selection Criteria', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiac resynchronization therapy', 'effective therapy', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'heart motion', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'tool']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2018,589455,0.04079959377985678
"Predicting contrast enhancement in multiple sclerosis with real time texture analysis Description: Identification of active lesions is critical for the management of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Currently this identification is based on post-contrast T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, there are safety concerns with repeated administration of gadolinium –based contrast agents (GBCAs). Thus, there is critical need for identifying active lesions without the use of GBCA. In this application we propose to identify the active lesions without administering GBCA using texture analysis (TA) using multi- modal non-contrast MRI and support vector machine (SVM) learning. A unique feature of this proposal is that the results will be analyzed using MRI data acquired on a large cohort of MS patients (~1000) as a part of phase III, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial (CombiRx). In addition texture features will be identified that can predict lesions that convert into tissue destructive lesions, so called black holes. This has important clinical implications since there is correlative evidence that balk holes are associated with clinical disability. A novelty of this project lies in performing texture analysis in real time that allows the physician to make the decision about administering GBCA on the spot while the patient is still in the scanner. This greatly helps in eliminating and/or minimizing the number of times GBCA needs to be administered. For real time analysis, the necessary infrastructure that includes automatic processing pipeline and integration of the MRI scanner with high performance computational resources located at Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) in Austin. Finally to establish real time TA as a viable alternative to GBCA administration for identifying active lesions, the developed methods will be prospectively applied to MS patients undergoing MRI scans as a part of routine clinical management. Public health relevance: Gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCAs) are routinely used for identifying active lesions in multiple sclerosis patients. However, there are safety concerns with repeated administration of GBCA. This proposal uses novel real time analysis for identifying lesions that are likely to enhance on pre- contrast MRI. Considering the large number of MS patients who are frequently scanned with GBCA, this proposal has a high degree of clinical relevance.",Predicting contrast enhancement in multiple sclerosis with real time texture analysis,9650821,R56NS105857,"['Advanced Development', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Effectiveness', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Evaluation', 'Gadolinium', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Liquid substance', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neuraxis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protons', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Spottings', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Texas', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'attenuation', 'austin', 'base', 'black hole', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computing resources', 'contrast enhanced', 'density', 'disability', 'high end computer', 'imaging facilities', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'prospective', 'public health relevance']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R56,2018,535749,-0.029539660920156845
"Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma Glioblastoma is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Despite advances in neurosurgical resection, radiation targeting, and chemotherapy, the prognosis remains grim with a median survival of just 15 months. The effectiveness of current radiation therapy strategies is severely limited by shortcomings in the imaging modalities used to develop treatment plans. Current radiation therapy planning is mainly based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, which identifies high grade tumors that are immediately associated with leaky neovasculature. Although it is an excellent diagnostic tool to identify high grade from low grade tumors, it is unable to signal occult infiltration beyond the core of the tumor. Though many believe GBM to be an incurable disease, we believe we have identified a method for optimizing tumor targeting that will increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy. A significant component of the current problem in GBM therapy is the lack of treatment for non-enhancing regions that are significantly infiltrated by neoplastic glioma cells without neovascularization. This untreated population undoubtedly leads to early recurrence. The proposed study addresses an important step toward translating an advanced quantitative imaging modality that complements the conventional imaging that is capable of reliably revealing glioma- infiltrated regions for precise, personalized treatment targeting. Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an alternative modality able to identify endogenous metabolism within tissue without the need for exogenous contrast, and has been shown to identify the metabolic abnormalities associated with tumor beyond the regions identified by T1-weighted MRI. The clinical integration of sMRI in patient management has been limited due to the computational challenges of analysis of sMRI data. Two key hurdles to be overcome are the insufficiency of filters to remove image artifacts and the necessity of quantification of metabolic levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism. As a result, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and many hours of computational and user time. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in radiation therapy planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning, an approach to computation that has shattered benchmarks in many medical and non-medical problems. Specifically, we will develop filters for removing artifacts, algorithms for personalized diagnosis of tumor infiltration, and explore deep learning as a method to synthesize sMRI data with anatomical and clinical metrics in a fully automated fashion. Success in the proposed work will produce a “scanner-to-clinician” platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into the clinical radiation therapy planning paradigm. Ultimately, we believe this additional modality in the physician's tool belt will lead to better outcomes in patients suffering from this debilitating disease. Project Narrative  Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is a molecular imaging modality that can accurately detect abnormalities in the metabolic signatures of tumor cells, making it ideal for the detection and monitoring of highly infiltrative brain tumors like glioblastoma. Clinical adoption of sMRI has been slow due to limited tools for expedient and objective processing of sMRI data into information that oncologists can use for therapy planning. This proposal addresses these challenges using recent advances in high performance computing and machine learning to develop a software framework for using sMRI in the clinical management of patients with glioblastoma.",Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma,9444495,F30CA206291,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Excision', 'Gaussian model', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Infiltration', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Neoplasms', 'Oncologist', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Framework', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'dosage', 'expectation', 'genomic data', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning network', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'metabolic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'neoplastic', 'neoplastic cell', 'neovascularization', 'neovasculature', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'software development', 'spectroscopic data', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'syntax', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'white matter']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F30,2018,49524,-0.0045409878279028355
"Distinguishing Lipid Subtypes by Amplifying Contrast from J-Coupling Project Summary/Abstract With the global rise in obesity-related diseases and increasing recognition of the role of fat in diseases such as fatty liver, there is growing need for a noninvasive chemical assay of in vivo lipid depots. But the rich chemistry of these molecules is often ignored in MRI, which typically treats fat as a homogeneous proton species because differences in chemical shift and relaxation are difficult to distinguish in a clinical setting. Innovation: This proposal will be the first to use nonuniform echo spacing to generate J-coupling based contrast between chemically different fats. While fat spins often give monotonically decaying signal under a uniformly spaced spin echo train, J-coupling causes nonuniformly spaced spin echo trains to generate complex fingerprints, which distinguish and even quantify fats with otherwise similar MR properties. Significance: The immediate clinical impact will be to demonstrate a novel J-coupling based contrast mechanism in vivo which will contribute to a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish the 25% of the population with benign steatosis from the 2-3% with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The broader significance of this work is that this novel contrast mechanism could revolutionize the study and clinical management of many diseases associated with bioactive lipid subtypes. Approach: The aims are designed to test the hypothesis that nonuniform echo trains (1) can create contrast between different fats, which (2) will contribute to a multiparametric noninvasive protocol to distinguish benign steatosis and NASH. Aim 1 will identify the echo spacing best suited for distinguishing benign steatosis and NASH, first using density matrix simulations based on high resolution spectra of liver fat from animals with each disease, and then using experiments on whole rat livers. In Aim 2, the sequence developed in Aim 1 will be tested in humans with biopsy proven benign steatosis or NASH, along with a suite of standard methods of liver and fat characterization. This metric, and also metrics derived from conventional images, will be tested for the ability to separate these patient groups. In addition, machine learning algorithms will be used to find a metric that combines multiecho intensities with standard MR metrics. This proposal will prove the usefulness of nonuniform echo trains as a new contrast mechanism and yield a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish simple steatosis and NASH. Moreover, this general approach to distinguish fats could ultimately find a broad range of biomedical applications, such as imaging lipid based therapeutics, distinguishing the 4 fatty acids that make up 90% of the adipose stores, or detecting other lipotoxic subtypes. The results of this work will justify a larger scale study to properly validate the sensitivity to different fat species in humans. Project Narrative This proposal will prove the usefulness of nonuniform echo trains both as a new J-coupling based contrast mechanism and as part of a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish simple steatosis (~25% of the population) from patients on the NASHfibrosiscirrhosis trajectory of metabolically induced liver disease (2- 3% of the population). Moreover, this general approach to distinguish fats could ultimately find a broad range of biomedical applications, such as imaging lipid based therapeutics, distinguishing the 4 fatty acids that make up 90% of the adipose stores, or detecting other lipotoxic subtypes.

"A TOF, DOI, MRI compatible PET detector to support sub-millimeter neuroPET imaging Abstract The overall goal of this research is to develop next generation positron emission tomography (PET) detector technology to support non-invasive, quantitative brain imaging at spatial and temporal resolutions currently not achievable with human neuro-PET systems. The developed PET detector technology will also be compatible with operation in an MRI system. The proposed research is targeted to the NIH Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) initiative. Human brain imaging with PET/MRI will be an essential tool in neuroscience studies to ""Develop innovative technologies to understand the human brain and treat its disorders; create and support integrated brain research networks."" The key advancement that we introduce is a PET detector with <100 psec time-of-flight (TOF) PET coincidence resolution, <2 mm continuous depth of interaction (DOI) positioning and intrinsic detector spatial resolution to support <1 mm PET image resolution throughout the system imaging field of view (FOV). Detector modules have been designed that individually achieve these performance metrics; however, no detector module has been designed that supports all of them. To make disruptive advancements in neuro-imaging using PET, one must push the image spatial resolution (i.e., currently 2-3 mm image resolution) as well as coincidence timing resolution and also be MRI compatible. The impact of this project is that we will advance the state of the art in all of these critical performance areas. We will achieve these goals by first understanding the role that different PET detector performance parameters have on task-based figures of merit for neuroPET imaging. We will investigate how both TOF and image resolution impact figure of merit performance for estimation, detection and characterization imaging tasks. Monte Carlo simulation will be used along with both object-based (i.e., mathematical) and anthropomorphic digital phantoms. Next we will optimize SiPM device selection, electronics and detector geometry for <100 psec TOF coincidence timing, 1 mm intrinsic spatial resolution and <2 mm DOI positioning resolution. We will build and characterize a prototype PET detector module utilizing a novel dual- sided slat crystal detector design. To advance coincidence timing performance we will investigate the use of machine learning to estimate the arrival time of detected events. Finally, we will optimize the detector design for MRI compatibility. We will fully test and characterize performance of our prototype detector on the benchtop and in a MRI scanner while running clinical MRI pulse sequences. At the end of this developmental project we will be in position to build a state of the art, MRI compatible, TOF, DOI PET imaging system. Narrative The overall goal of this work is to develop detector imaging technology that will enable new research into the development, function and aging of the human brain.

"Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calcium scoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in the asymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surrounding the heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due to the absence of robust, automated quantification methods.  We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robust quantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a new integrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in two existing, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, late revascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) and the St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To develop and evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of new computational algorithms for automated quantification of EAT measures; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified EAT features, relative to atherosclerotic plaque burden and measures of obesity, for the prediction of future cardiac events in asymptomatic patients in the EISNER registry and the St. Francis Heart Study; 3) To derive and evaluate a new, integrated risk score—combining standard risk factors, coronary calcium score and EAT measures using machine learning—for the prediction of future cardiac events in the EISNER registry, and further, to additionally evaluate this risk score externally in the St. Francis Heart Study patient cohort.  This work in this proposal will provide a novel, personalized paradigm that will objectively and accurately identify asymptomatic patients undergoing coronary calcium scanning who are at increased risk for future cardiac events, without any additional imaging or risk to the patient. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) CT scanning of the heart for coronary calcium scoring is a simple, widely-used, low-cost test with low radiation dose. Using these scans, the researchers propose to establish automated analysis of fat which surrounds the heart, as well as novel computerized scores that identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack. This new research will allow doctors to better identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to avoid a heart attack or sudden cardiac death.",Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events,9475874,R01HL133616,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational algorithm', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early identification', 'Event', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Institution', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Interleukin-6', 'Language', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Reader', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Visceral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'coronary artery calcium', 'coronary calcium scoring', 'coronary vasculature', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'pericardial sac', 'predictive marker', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'routine imaging', 'sudden cardiac death']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,653101,0.023825428910864244
"Imaging and Dosimetry of Yttrium-90 for Personalized Cancer Treatment Supplement Title: Deep learning-based methods for PET image reconstruction and segmentation to enhance radionuclide therapy dosimetry Abstract There is much recent interest in quantitative imaging of yttrium-90 (Y-90) for dosimetry because of the promise of novel Y-90 labelled radionuclide therapies. Deep learning methods are well suited for addressing the challenges of Y-90 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, where compared with diagnostic FDG PET, true coincidence count-rates are very low while random coincidences are high. The potential of deep learning-based algorithms to outperform conventional algorithms in medical imaging is well recognized, however research in applying these methods to nuclear medicine imaging modalities such as PET is very limited. The few studies applying deep learning to PET imaging have been mostly limited to post-reconstruction image processing/analysis for denoising and feature extraction, and not in the image formation/reconstruction process. Additionally, deep learning research in PET thus far have focused on improving diagnostic imaging, not quantitative imaging, which together with accurate lesion/organ segmentation are pre-requisite for accurate dosimetry. In this supplement, we propose to develop and evaluate deep learning-based image reconstruction and lesion/organ segmentation for low count PET applications such as Y-90 PET. Our approach starts with the raw projection data and utilizes a deep recurrent network in the image formation process. Because the two tasks are mutually dependent, our formalism takes the novel approach of joint reconstruction-segmentation with multi-modality (PET/CT) data. Specifically, we will 1) develop and evaluate Y-90 PET image reconstruction with a deep recurrent network for the regularizer, 2) develop and evaluate deep-learning based joint PET segmentation-reconstruction using multi- modal 90Y PET/CT data. To train/validate/test the proposed methods, we will use clinically realistic phantom measurements and simulations as well as leverage on existing patient data from the parent grant where thus far, PET data and radiologist defined morphologic liver/lesion contours for over 50 cases and 150 lesions are available. We will compare the new Y-90 PET reconstruction with the formulation we recently developed under the parent grant (using conventional untrained regularizers) that showed promising results but suffered from resolution- noise tradeoff. The expected outcome of this work is a well validated deep learning reconstruction- segmentation framework for challenging PET imaging applications where conventional methods are suboptimal. The proposed research is expected to result in new and accurate tools for quantitative image reconstruction and lesion/organ segmentation that have the potential to contribute significantly toward improving dosimetry in internal radionuclide therapy such as Yttrium- 90 radioembolization in liver malignancies. This study is relevant to public health because a dosimetry-guided personalized approach to radionuclide therapy is highly likely to substantially improve patient outcomes compared to current standard practice. !",Imaging and Dosimetry of Yttrium-90 for Personalized Cancer Treatment,9750430,R01EB022075,"['90Y', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Formulation', 'Image', 'Joint repair', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphology', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radioembolization', 'Radionuclide therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'deep learning', 'dosimetry', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'parent grant', 'personalized approach', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,102093,0.038522023612031116
"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning. Success of the project will overcome the major technical hurdles in the use of MRI in radiation therapy and will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information.

"In Vivo Mapping of Uncharted Functional Units of Tongue Motion During Speech Project Summary Tongue cancer and the treatments used to cure the disease such as glossectomy can have debilitating effects on speech and swallowing, yet not much is known about the relationship between tongue movements in speech and reconstruction choices after cancer resection. The tongue’s vital role in speaking and swallowing is executed by a uniquely complex array of muscles which deform locally into functional units. Tongue movements are governed by synergistic activation of these functional units using orthogonally oriented muscle fibers not a rigid skeletal structure. Functional units, which are regions of 3D coherent motion, are the structures that link low-level muscle activity to high-level surface tongue geometry. This link, the organization of functional units, can provide considerable insight into normal motor control and adapted tongue motion, as in patients who have had surgery for tongue cancer. However, there is poor understanding of the details of how muscle morphology contributes to function due to tongue muscle interdigitation and complex local activation. A key to understanding the relationship between the structure and function of the tongue is to identify functional units of motion in localized tongue regions and map them to muscle anatomy. A large step in this direction can be gained by developing a tool to cluster 3D coherent motion patterns from tagged MRI, and register them to muscle anatomy from high-resolution MRI. Speech motor control is a critical area of importance where platform tools for machine learning techniques are lacking. The goal of this project is to create a framework to relate the functional units to tongue muscle anatomy. This framework will enhance tongue motion analysis in medical research and clinical applications, where MRI is frequently used. To address this goal, we have already developed technologies to analyze high-resolution and tagged-MRI. The first is a detailed 3D muscle atlas based on 3D high-resolution MRI, which depicts the locations of both extrinsic and intrinsic muscles, and will be registered to each speaker to identify and track their muscles in the 3D tagged data sets. The second is software to derive 3D displacement and strain fields from tagged MR images. These displacements, strains, and derived quantities will be used to extract spatio-temporal feature vectors that define coherent regions, which will be verified with simulation. The vectors will then be input into a novel computational method using a NMF and clustering, the goal of which is to establish the functional units of speech. In addition, biomechanical simulations will be used to co-validate our findings. The concept of functional units is at the core of the proposed work, as it can provide insights into tongue muscle coordination in patients after glossectomy surgery. The research plan comprises two specific aims: (1) develop a computational method to establish functional units from MRI and (2) determine the relationship between alterations in anatomy and alterations in functional unit motion after tongue cancer treatment. Linking the functional units to the anatomy will allow the design of more focused treatments and therapies for tongue motion-related disorders. Project Narrative Functions of the tongue—speaking, eating, and breathing—are executed by using a complex muscular array to create global motions (synergies) by deforming local functional units which are intermediate structures that link muscle activity to surface tongue geometry. This project will develop new computational tools that will enable researchers and clinicians to determine the functional units of specific motions and relate them to the muscle anatomy. Such a breakthrough will dramatically improve our knowledge of the mechanisms of muscle coordination, thereby permitting improvement of diagnosis and treatment of tongue motion-related disorders.",In Vivo Mapping of Uncharted Functional Units of Tongue Motion During Speech,9452335,R21DC016047,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Bone structure', 'Breathing', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Elements', 'Excision', 'Geometry', 'Gestures', 'Glossectomy', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Fibers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Therapy', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Extracts', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Treatment-Related Cancer', 'Unit of Measure', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'digital', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'malignant tongue neoplasm', 'motor control', 'muscular structure', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predict clinical outcome', 'reconstruction', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'synergism', 'theories', 'tool', 'vector']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2018,249441,-0.036969858568490055
"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more. This will be accomplished by: optimizing the image processing that is used, further developing new and better image processing methods, and developing a method of ""personalized imaging"", in which, for each individual patient, the minimum amount of imaging agent needed to obtain a good image is computed.",Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging,9476341,R01HL122484,"['3D ultrasound', '4D Imaging', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Protection', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radioactive', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'computer program', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging agent', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'perfusion imaging', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,770494,0.04689401739310822
"Systems biology modeling of radiation resistance and chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma Tumor resistance to radiation therapy remains a significant obstacle to long-term cancer patient survival, especially for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a cancer type with poor long-term outcomes (less than 50% advanced stage five-year survival). To overcome the problem of radiation resistance, radiation therapy is being combined with radiation-sensitizing chemotherapies. Prediction of an individual’s sensitivity to radiation and specific chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies prior to treatment would improve the development of personalized treatment plans for cancer patients. Efforts are being made to create systems biology models of cancer cells for biomarker discovery and prediction of treatment response; however, due to methodological shortcomings, failure to integrate multi-omic data on a genome-scale, and lack of specificity to individual patient tumors, these predictive models have yet to be implemented clinically. To address these needs, the objective of this project is to develop a personalized systems biology modeling platform for individualized prediction of HNSCC patient tumor response to radiation and chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies. These models will be created by first integrating comprehensive biological data on individual patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). This approach will allow for the comparison of metabolic, signaling, and phenotypic signatures between radiation-sensitive and radiation-resistant patient tumors. By then integrating the mechanisms of action of radiation therapy and radiation-sensitizing chemotherapies into the modeling framework, the response to particular chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies in individual radiation- resistant patient tumors can be predicted. Machine learning classifiers will be developed from TCGA patient data and model predictions to determine which biological and clinical factors are most predictive of radiation sensitivity and chemotherapy-radiation combination therapy success. It is hypothesized that differential response to chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies in radiation-resistant HNSCC tumors is accomplished through redox metabolism and signaling, and components of redox biology within the modeling framework will significantly enrich the list of predictive biomarkers for combination therapy success. Although the focus of this project will be on HNSCC, this systems biology modeling approach will be applicable to any cancer type. The outcomes of this project will be a reduced set of clinically-measurable biomarkers for accurate prediction of HNSCC patient response to radiation therapy and specific chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies, as well as a precision medicine platform to test clinically relevant therapeutic strategies. This project is innovative because it combines multi-omic cancer patient data with state-of-the-art systems biology modeling techniques to investigate the biological mechanisms of radiation resistance, as well as to predict chemotherapy-radiation combination therapy response in individual radiation-resistant patients. Combination therapies that include both radiation and chemotherapy are currently being developed for cancer patients that do not respond well to radiation therapy alone. This research will provide insights into why particular head and neck cancer patients do not respond well to radiation therapy, as well as predict which chemotherapy- radiation combination treatments will be most effective for individual patients. Findings from this research will improve our ability to develop personalized treatment plans for cancer patients, which will decrease healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes.",Systems biology modeling of radiation resistance and chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,9541230,F30CA224968,"['Address', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human papilloma virus infection', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Measurable', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'NADP', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Cancer Model', 'Predictive Value', 'Prior Therapy', 'Production', 'RNA Interference', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Tobacco use', 'beta-Lapachone', 'biomarker discovery', 'cancer cell', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically relevant', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'radiation resistance', 'radiation response', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'success', 'transcription factor', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NCI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F30,2018,44589,0.008246262205613808
"2018 In Vivo Magnetic Resonance Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar PROJECT SUMMARY  The field of magnetic resonance (MR) is in the midst of a revolution. Disruptive external forces, such as the advent of powerful new Artificial Intelligence methods, coupled with a recent creative ferment in method development within the field, is changing the way we think about the acquisition, the reconstruction, and the interpretation of MR data. Meanwhile, MR has long been an indispensable tool not only for basic discovery but also for medical diagnostics, but the value proposition of clinical MR imaging is also changing, against the backdrop of a shifting healthcare landscape.  There is a palpable need to explore the full scope of these changes, in a forum that enables deep dives and focused discussion, without losing the necessary breath of perspective. While large meetings such as the annual scientific meeting of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM) have the necessary breath, the sheer size and pace of such meetings work against the requisite focus. On the other hand, short focused workshops are better suited to the evaluation of progress in well-defined subfields.  The goal of this grant application is to support a high-impact conference with a time-tested format which is ideally suited to assess recent changes in the field of in vivo MR. The tenth Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on In Vivo Magnetic Resonance will be held July 15 to 20, 2018, at Proctor Academy, in Andover, NH. Our GRC will also be associated with the first-ever trainee-organized and trainee-focused Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on In Vivo Magnetic Resonance, which will take place on the weekend before the GRC (July 14-15, 2018). The trainee seminar meshes well with our goal of preparing young scientists for a changing field and a changing world. We request funding to support graduate students and postdoctoral fellows attending these meetings, which will focus explicitly on the shifting role of MR in a rapidly changing world.  The GRC, subtitled “Challenging assumptions about MR technology and applications in a changing world,” will be led by Chair Daniel K. Sodickson, MD, PhD, and Vice Chair Jeff F. Dunn, PhD, and will build upon a rich history of In Vivo MR GRCs. The GRS, subtitled “The Changing World of Magnetic Resonance: Old Physics, New Techniques,” will be led by Chair Scott Beeman, PhD, and Vice Chair Carson Hoffman, BSc, and will further enhance the experience of trainees with tailored opportunities for mentorship, networking, and scientific exchange.  Specific aims of our 2018 GRC and GRS on In Vivo MR are as follows:  1. Explore disruptive forces and marshal disruptive innovation in the field of in vivo MR  2. Foster connections between MR and surrounding disciplines  3. Prepare young scientists to make a difference in a rapidly changing world PROJECT NARRATIVE Support is requested for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to attend the tenth Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on In Vivo Magnetic Resonance, scheduled for July 15-20, 2018, and the inaugural trainee- focused Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) to precede the conference on July 14-15, 2018. The GRC will be focused on “Challenging assumptions about MR technology and applications in a changing world,” with the goal of taking the measure of disruptive forces such as Artificial Intelligence, and marshaling disruptive innovations in the acquisition, reconstruction, and interpretation of MR data. The companion GRS will have a related focus on “The changing world of magnetic resonance: old physics, new techniques,” and will provide trainees (who will attend the GRC as well) with opportunities for presentation of their work to peers and thought leaders, discussion of emerging areas of MR, and focused networking and mentorship.",2018 In Vivo Magnetic Resonance Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar,9608839,R13EB026933,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Anniversary', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Books', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'International', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marshal', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Palpable', 'Physics', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'biophysical model', 'c new', 'commune', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'design', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'magnetic field', 'meetings', 'method development', 'peer', 'posters', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIBIB,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2018,5000,0.030276841038769854
"Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect, affecting 1.2% of all live births. Imaging plays a major role in managing CHD but remains challenging for evaluating complex cardiac and vascular abnormalities across a wide range of age and habitus. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed cardiovascular 4D flow MRI which can measure complex 3D blood flow in-vivo, a task difficult or impossible to obtain with other imaging strategies. Recent efforts have focused on two forms of CHD: 1) bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) which is the most common form of CHD, and 2) single ventricle physiology (SVP), one of the most severe forms of CHD. Our 4D flow MRI studies have successfully identified new hemodynamic biomarkers to better characterize CHD. We were the first to establish a physiologic link between aberrant 3D blood flow, elevated wall shear stress (WSS), aortopathy phenotype, and aortic wall tissue degeneration on histopathology in patients with BAV. In patients with SVP, our findings demonstrated relationships between surgical correction strategies and flow distribution to the lungs, a known factor implicated in SVP outcome. We have achieved successful clinical translation at Northwestern, where 4D flow MRI is now used as a clinical tool in diagnostic MRI exams for patients with CHD and aortic disease. Over the past four years, the PIs have assembled one of the largest 4D MRI databases with over 2500 patient exams. For this renewal application, we identified a need to increase the dynamic range of 4D MRI flow sensitivity to account for data complexity (3D + time) and the wide age range in CHD by a combination of dual-venc flow encoding, compressed sensing, and SSFP imaging. Second, three is a need for longitudinal studies to identify predictors of BAV and SVP outcome. Third, making these unique but complex 4D MRI data sets and analysis tools more widely available to the greater research community is challenging. In addition, no automated methods currently exist for advanced processing such as atlas based analysis across large cohorts. Analysis is thus time consuming and requires manual interactions (e.g. 3D vessel segmentation) which limits reproducibility and translation. To address this need, an established Northwestern data archival and pipeline processing resource based on remote high-performance computing clusters (NUNDA) will be utilized for standardized data archival, sharing, and pipeline processing of 4D MRI data. This platform will provide the unique opportunity to utilize annotated data available in the 4D MRI database (>1300 BAV, SVP, and control 4D MRI data analyzed in the initial funding cycle) for application of machine learning concepts to establish (semi-)automated 4D MRI analysis workflows in NUNDA. Thus, the renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop a rapid (15 min) non-contrast 4D MRI for clinical translation, 2) leverage the existing large 4D MRI database to identify 4D MRI metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) CHD patient outcome, and 3) establish a remote NUNDA platform for 4D MRI data sharing and automated analysis across large cohorts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop non-contrast 4D MRI, a new diagnostic test to achieve an improved assessment for the most common and one of the most severe forms of congenital heart disease: bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. We will leverage an existing large 4D MRI database to allow for long-term 5-8-year follow-up to establish new measures for improved outcome prediction and therapy management for patients with bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. A comprehensive data archive will be established to allow for the dissemination of the 4D MRI data, analysis tools, and study results to the greater research community.",Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease,9515521,R01HL115828,"['4D MRI', 'Acceleration', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Aortic Diseases', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Common Ventricle', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Rate', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Oxygen', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Secure', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'adverse outcome', 'aortic valve', 'base', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'clinical translation', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data archive', 'data sharing', 'design', 'exercise capacity', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'prevent', 'sex', 'shear stress', 'spatiotemporal', 'tissue degeneration', 'tool', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,704597,0.06535072083215461
"Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology using 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography Each year, 735,000 Americans have an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), and approximately 120,000 die from it. Heart attacks occur most commonly due to rupture of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries. Despite this, current diagnostic and treatment algorithms make no allowance for the assessment of disease activity and currently all patients with atherosclerosis are treated in a similar manner. This failure to differentiate stable from active disease may result in potentially unnecessary or insufficient therapies. In a breakthrough series of studies, our co-investigators discovered that positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-sodium- fluoride (18F-NaF; an inexpensive and widely available tracer approved by Food and Drug Administration) can readily identify plaque rupture and increased coronary plaque activity. We propose to build further on this success, by addressing several important remaining limitations that prevent us from translating this technology to broad clinical use. The limitations include complicated and subjective image analysis, underutilization of the concomitant coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) for plaque characterization, inability to utilize prior CTA for the analysis of 18F-NaF PET, lack of methods to integrate all available PET and CTA data and significant motion of the coronaries during the PET scan. We propose a multi-faceted approach to automate and improve coronary 18F-NaF PET imaging by full integration with CTA and correction for cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion. The overall goal of the proposal is to optimize the measurement of disease activity in coronary atherosclerosis using integrated 18F-NaF PET/CTA imaging, with the opportunity to validate this development against clinical outcome in a “real-world” multicenter patient study. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: 1) to integrate quantification of CTA and PET image data 2) to develop new methods for simultaneous correction of cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion for coronary PET, and 3) to clinically evaluate new methods in a multicenter clinical trial (separately funded and already underway), further refining risk prediction for heart attacks with integrated PET+CTA risk score derived by machine learning. This work will lead to a robust and reproducible clinical method for stratification of patients for risk of heart attacks, with potential to be applied for the identification of patients who would most benefit from expensive, and potentially risky treatments. Our techniques could also be used in future clinical trials to test the efficacy of novel therapies. Moreover, the new analysis will be applicable to other PET tracers that may be developed to investigate other pathological processes in the coronary vasculature. The resulting software will be shared with clinical institutions performing coronary PET to facilitate standardization and automation of this novel plaque imaging technique. NARRATIVE A heart attack, a major cause of death, is most commonly caused by rupture of deposits in heart vessels, leading to sudden blockage of the blood flow in the vessels and disruption of blood supply to the heart muscle. Currently there is no reliable test to identify deposits at the highest risk of rupture, but in a recent scientific breakthrough, positron emission tomography has demonstrated capability to image disease activity inside these deposits, linked to their rupture; this technique, however, is currently hampered by lack of anatomical reference, image blurring due to heart motion, and variability of manual analysis. We propose to address these problems by developing automatic software that precisely integrates anatomical and biological information and virtually “freezes” vessel motion, validating this new approach in a large “real-world” multicenter patient study.",Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography,9539728,R01HL135557,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Blood flow', 'Breast Microcalcification', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Failure', 'Fluorides', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammation', 'Institution', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Translating', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'atherosclerotic plaque rupture', 'coronary computed tomography angiography', 'coronary plaque', 'coronary vasculature', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'heart motion', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'success', 'uptake', 'virtual']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,756791,0.06703833209830713
"Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification Project Abstract Motivation: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 500 million people. Children commonly develop CKD from urinary obstructive diseases and nephrotoxic therapies, and then suffer severe growth failure, hyper- tension, cardiovascular risks, and neurocognitive deﬁcits, and eventually end-stage kidney disease. Accurate renal function quantiﬁcation will improve clinical management of hydronephrosis (1 in 100 babies) and dos- ing/selection of chemotherapeutic regimens in oncology patients. Glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR), the biomarker of renal function, is derived from blood or urine tests. These tests only provide global GFR and are limited in accuracy, especially in children, and even more so in children with cancer. MRI offers superb anatomic delineation without ionizing radiation, and is thus ideal for pediatric kidney imaging. However, MRI has not been widely adopted for pediatric renal function evaluation due to lack of reliability and cumbersome workﬂow. These hurdles stem from the fact that the critical components required for global and regional GFR calculation, including high spatiotemporal resolution, plasma ﬂow and arterial input function, are difﬁcult to obtain, and that accurate image segmentation of kidneys (cortex and medulla) is labor intensive. Additionally, although the same contrast agent injection can be used for obstruction evaluation, certain areas of the kidney suffer from signiﬁcant signal loss using standard MRI acquisition techniques due to high contrast agent concentrations. This project addresses these major challenges for automated comprehensive renal function evaluation in children. Approach: The project has three development aims, which are validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable novel free-breathing time-resolved 3D dynamic contrast enhanced MRI that simultaneously provides accurate GFR calculation and renal plasma ﬂow. This is achieved by incorporating self-navigated motion compensation, fast acquisition with parallel imaging and compressed sensing, and phase-contrast ﬂow imaging. The second aim is to develop multiple new image analysis methods to extract GFR and renal plasma ﬂow (RPF) that lever- age novel ﬂow data of Aim 1, as well as automated new machine-learning image processing techniques for the segmentation of kidneys and ultimately global and regional GFR calculation. In Aim 3, we will develop and integrate ultrashort-echo-time techniques to address the MRI signal loss due to T2* effects from high contrast concentration for patients with obstruction, and further incorporate motion compensation and accelerated imag- ing methods to enable time-resolved high-resolution dynamic MRI for contrast washout kinetics analysis in the same MR exam. Aim 4 will determine the performance of these methods in a clinical setting. Signiﬁcance: This work will lead to robust, automated comprehensive pediatric renal MRI for safer and more accurate renal function evaluation in children. The techniques will facilitate widespread application in the com- munity setting and permit robust evaluation of renal function, for both children and adults. Project Narrative Kidney diseases in children often stem from blockages of the urinary tract or toxicity from medications, such as antibiotics or chemotherapies. Kidney function quantiﬁcation is crucial for clinical management of these children.

"Automatic quantification of myocardial motion in older adults Abstract  Heart failure (HF) is a common condition that represents the end stage of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) subsequent to progressing myocardial damage or ischemia. In populations at ages 65 and older, coronary artery disease (CAD) serves as the leading cause of HF. Although low left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) is a major evidence for the diagnosis of HF in clinical practice, impaired regional myocardial dysfunction is expected to present the existence of CAD in its early stage.  Heart deformation analysis (HDA) is a cutting-edge myocardial motion analysis technique that is able to automatically track the myocardium borders on time frames and calculate global and regional cardiac functional and motional indices on existing cine images without extra scans. In the present study, we will use the HDA tool to analyze existing cine images of CHARISMA study. From 2009 to 2012, cardiac MRI exams (including coronary wall imaging and cine MRI at two-chamber, four-chamber and short-axis views) and concurrent tests for traditional cardiovascular risk factors were performed on 440 older participants (age: 65 - 84 years old at the time of MRI scans) without documented history of CVDs. During the present R03 project (2019-2021), CHARISMA participants would have been followed-up for 10 - 12 years. We plan to relate newly- acquired regional myocardial motion indices (displacement, velocity, strain and strain rate) to clinical outcomes, existing coronary wall measures and results of lab tests in CHARISMA datasets. We will test the overall hypothesis that regional myocardial motion indices have the potential to present cardiovascular risk in asymptomatic elderly. Three specific aims are: 1) Predict cardiovascular events using baseline regional myocardial motion indices; 2) Relate regional myocardial motion indices to MRI-derived features of coronary remodeling; and 3) Determine correlations between regional myocardial motion indices and traditional cardiovascular risk biomarkers/conditions collected in CHARISMA study.  No new MRI scans or lab tests are required in this project. Through a cost-effective approach, the immediate objective of the proposed project is to evaluate the clinical value of regional myocardial motion for cardiovascular risk stratification in asymptomatic older adults, a major target population of cardiovascular prevention. This study will also help us better understand the correlations between impaired myocardial function/motion and subclinical CAD burden. Furthermore, the results will facilitate the selection of quantitative imaging biomarkers and their optimal cut-off points for predicting cardiovascular events in future clinical studies. Project Narrative  In the present study, we will use heart deformation analysis (HDA) to reanalyze existing cardiac MRI data of CHARISMA study. The goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis that regional myocardial motion indices have the potential to predict cardiovascular risk in older adults.",Automatic quantification of myocardial motion in older adults,9647817,R03HL144891,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chicago', 'Cine Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gelatinase B', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart failure', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction', 'Left Ventricular Mass', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Myocardium', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peroxidases', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radial', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Smoking', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ventricular', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'coronary plaque', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diabetic patient', 'follow-up', 'healthy aging', 'heart damage', 'human old age (65+)', 'human subject', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'myocardial damage', 'quantitative imaging', 'tool']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R03,2018,79000,-0.00483932096393378
"Quantifiable Thermal Therapy Using Magnetic Resonance Thermometry Imaging Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States, and is characterized with dismal odds due to advanced disease at late stage diagnosis. The 5-year survival rate ranges from 7% for patients with non-resectable disease (~80% of patients), to ~23% for patients with resectable tumors (< 20%of patients). PDAC, like most solid tumors, is highly hypoxic, resulting from both poor oxygen delivery due to leaky and chaotic vasculature and increased oxygen consumption due to high metabolic activity. This makes drug delivery to the tumor microenvironment more difficult and often ineffective. In the past 40 years, only marginal improvements in complete response (CR), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and quality of life (QoL) have occurred despite the development of a number of promising chemotherapy, or chemoradiation regimens. New and improved therapeutic options are urgently needed to improve the treatment of this disease. Mild hyperthermia (HT) in the range of 39-42°C has shown to improve blood flow to tumors, enhancing the delivery of therapeutics to the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Numerous randomized clinical trials have shown to provide CR, PFS, OR and QoL benefits but implementation in clinical practice has been lagging due to the inability to provide safe, quantifiable and controlled therapeutic thermal dose through accurate temperature monitoring. NTO has designed and built the VectronTTx device which can effectively deliver heat non-invasively in deep tissue without causing skin burns or excessive fat heating (the most common adverse effect encountered with current technologies) without the need for a cooling mechanism such as a water bolus that is a frequent cause for interrupted treatments due to patient discomfort. The heating elements of the device are integrated into an applicator with magnetic resonance (MR) transmit and receive channels to allow for real-time MR thermometry imaging (MRTI) measurements. In this Phase I proposal, we will develop novel MRTI methodologies that significantly improve the state-of-the-art by accurately measuring temperature over HT treatment time scales (30-60 minutes) in an abdominal environment compensating for interfering processes including field drift and motion-induced field variations. We will also develop a treatment- modeling architecture that combines virtual models, patient-specific features, and an artificial intelligence (AI)- based architecture to create extrapolated patient-specific treatment plans. Upon successful completion of Phase I and validation of the developed real-time MRTI monitoring techniques, we will develop methods in Phase II for accurate measurements of temperature in fat by incorporating interleaved or hybrid fat-based techniques into the field-corrected MRTI sequences. In phase II, we will also develop and implement the infrastructure to perform personalized treatment planning. This treatment planning will be based on conventional image transformations, conventional EM-solving, and AI learning of thermal sink and tissue properties. Numerous clinical trials have shown that mild hyperthermia in conjunction with chemotherapy or radiation therapy is a promising strategy to treat cancer. However, adoption in the clinic will require the ability to measure temperature in the heated regions both for safety and to verify tumor heating. NeoTherma Oncology (NTO) has developed a device that can heat tumors non-invasively within a Magnetic Resonance scanner (MR), which will allow the MR to be used to map temperatures inside the body. In this proposal, NTO and the University of Utah will develop MR methods that will provide accurate and precise measurement of temperature in near real-time, allowing evaluation of this device for clinical use.",Quantifiable Thermal Therapy Using Magnetic Resonance Thermometry Imaging,9623256,R43CA233401,"['Abdomen', 'Ablation', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Burn injury', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cardiac', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Device Safety', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heating', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperthermia', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'In complete remission', 'Industrialization', 'International', 'Interruption', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Oxygen', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Regimen', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resectable', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Source', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Thermometry', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'crowdsourcing', 'data archive', 'design', 'dosage', 'experience', 'hyperthermia treatment', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'prototype', 'radio frequency', 'real time monitoring', 'respiratory', 'standard of care', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor hypoxia', 'tumor microenvironment', 'virtual']",NCI,"NEOTHERMA ONCOLOGY, INC.",R43,2018,299014,-0.012917409190481928
"Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop a framework for high-performance parallel transmission (pTx) that is trans- ferable to a wide range of MRI scanners, and apply it to push the spatial encoding limits of echo planar imaging (EPI) at 7 Tesla. EPI is by far the most widely used pulse sequence for rapid functional, diffusion, and perfusion imaging, and has been the focus of considerable development in recent years to increase its speed and spatial resolution. Now there is a strong desire to push EPI's spatial resolution down to the micro scale. For functional MRI (fMRI), this would enable imaging of ﬁne structures (layers, columns, and nuclei) of cortical and subcortical architecture while better resolving the hemodynamic response. For diffusion MRI (dMRI), micro scale EPI would improve surface and laminar analysis of ﬁbers in the cortex, as well as brain parcelation using fractional anisotropy differences between gray matter regions, while broadly reducing partial volume effects. It would further enable EPI to be broadly applied to accelerate anatomic scans that are geometrically matched to fMRI and dMRI scans. However, increasing the resolution of single-shot EPI requires longer readouts which extend echo times and re- duce functional contrast in fMRI and signal-to-noise in dMRI at 7 Tesla, while increasing geometric distortions and blurring. Segmented or multishot EPI is a classic method to increase spatial resolution without increasing readout durations, but is underutilized, primarily due to its high sensitivity to motion and dynamic phase changes between shots which cause large image artifacts.  We propose to develop a new multishot EPI technique called shuttered EPI, which addresses the lim- itations of conventional multishot EPI by imaging a set of spatially disjoint shutters in each shot. The shutters are produced by a multidimensional excitation pulse and are spatially shifted between shots to cover an entire slice. However, with thin slices the length of the excitation pulses are impractical (20-100 ms). Many-coil pTx (> 8 coils) can shorten the length of these pulses to feasible durations, but current 7 Tesla scanners have only 8 transmit channels due to cost, footprint, cabling, and other constraints. In the ﬁrst project period we pioneered a technique called array-compressed pTx (acpTx) which overcomes this limitation. Using acpTx, 8 transmit chan- nels can control an arbitrarily large number of coils, where the channels and coils are connected via an array compression network that is optimized with RF pulses for speciﬁc excitations. In this project, we will develop and apply acpTx methods and hardware (a many-coil head transmit array and an 8 channel-to-many coil array com- pression network) to achieve feasible RF pulse durations when exciting the shutter patterns required for shuttered EPI. These developments will be implemented on two major 7T scanner platforms and evaluated in submillimeter (600 micron) fMRI and dMRI acquisitions. Overall, the project encompasses the synergistic design of RF pulses, hardware, acquisitions and reconstructions to achieve a major advance in spatial encoding. Project Narrative Diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 7 Tesla ﬁeld strength using echo planar imaging (EPI) has the potential to deliver clear images of brain structure and function at the level of layers, columns, and nuclei. However, when existing EPI scans are pushed to the spatial resolutions required to resolve these structures, they become highly sensitive to off resonance-induced geometric distortions, relaxation-induced blur- ring, physiological noise and motion. To address this problem, in this project we will develop many-coil array- compressed parallel transmission and apply it to enable shuttered multishot EPI scans that are robust to these effects.",Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T,9524416,R01EB016695,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Homebound Persons', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Length', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Problem Formulations', 'Relaxation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cost', 'design', 'gray matter', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'motion sensitivity', 'neuroimaging', 'perfusion imaging', 'phase change', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'simulation', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'time use', 'transmission process', 'virtual']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,598063,0.01540194934256546
"Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During medical imaging, patient motion is virtually unavoidable presenting a significant source of image degradation and artifacts, which in turn, can impact the quality of care received by many patients. One method used to address patient motion is to employ visual tracking systems (VTS), which involves placing a small number of reflective markers on the patient that can be located and tracked in 3D space using stereo cameras. The tracked markers can then be used as a surrogate to a structure of interest, such as the heart. The tracked surrogate provides a quantifiable measure that can be directly correlated with the motion of the target structure, which can then be used for prospective or retrospective motion correction. However, the markers add complexity to patient workflow, provide only a sparse sampling of the patient's surface, and the optimal number and placement of markers is unknown. This project addresses the shortcomings of marker-based VTS systems by proposing to develop and test a novel low-cost marker-less VTS system for tracking patient motion within a hybrid imaging system. The primary barrier for successfully tracking the patient's body surface using marker-less VTS is that clothing prevents an unobstructed view of the patient's body. The candidate, Dr. Lindsay, is proposing to incorporate a translational method using computational approaches to compensate for garments within the proposed marker-less VTS system. Dr. Lindsay has received training in computer science and computer vision and previously has focused on the computational aspects of capturing, modeling, and rendering of physical phenomena such as light and is proposing to extend this knowledge to the medical imaging field. Dr. Lindsay's goals for this proposal are to acquire the necessary training and skills that will allow him to translate his expertise and existing computational skills to an area f research with medical relevance: namely, detecting and tracking patient motion for the purpose of improving motion correction for hybrid- imaging. Dr. Lindsay's long-term career goal is to become an accomplished independent investigator focusing on solving significant problems in medical imaging by translating advances in Computer Science. The proposed work will take place the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (UMass) in Worcester, MA under the primary mentorship of Dr. Michael King, an internationally known expert in the area of medical imaging and medical physics in Nuclear Medicine. Drs. Gennert, Sullivan, Licho have expertise in computer vision, mechanical engineering and medical imaging, and radiology and Nuclear Medicine, respectively will also serve as co-mentors.  The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) develop a novel marker-less VTS, which we call PT- Cam, using low-cost using state-of-the-art camera technology, 2) model surface motion as a surrogate for internal motion of the heart, and 3) conduct tests of the PT-Cam system, in order to determine the acceptability and feasibility of clinical usage, on patients undergoing clinical MPI PET/CT imaging. Thus, the main objective of this program of research is to develop a clinically viable method for motion tracking patients undergoing hybrid-imaging studies by using a novel marker-less surface-tracking method that can compensate for clothing and provide modeling of interior motion of structures from surface tracking. If successful, not only will this project provide an innovative, marker-less VTS system for low-cost surface tracking for motion compensation during hybrid imaging but it will also give the candidate the necessary training needed to become an independent investigator in the medical field and potentially a leader in the field of medical imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 7.2 million people per year die world-wide from coronary artery disease (CAD), and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become a critical tool for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment of CAD. During medical imaging such as MPI, patient motion is virtually unavoidable and presents a significant source of image degradation and it has been suggested that upwards of 40% of cardiac studies in PET are effected by some type of motion with similar findings for SPECT. The proposed project will directly address the shortcomings of previous methods for tracking patient motion by developing and testing a novel low-cost marker-less visual tracking system for patient motion within hybrid imaging.",Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging,9517057,K25EB019032,"['Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Body Surface', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clothing', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Optics', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Security', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'heart motion', 'imaging study', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'perfusion imaging', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'skills', 'success', 'validation studies', 'virtual', 'visual tracking', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K25,2018,169609,0.03863896342913797
"Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  Modern radiation therapy treatment planning relies on volumetric (CT, or sometimes MRI) imaging to determine tumor location and spread. In addition, radiation oncologists treating head and neck cancer have long used a specific endoscopy - nasopharyngoscopy - to augment the treatment planning volumetric scan. In endoscopy, a thin, flexible light-pipe with a camera is inserted into the patient to obtain optical videos. Endoscopy is done because it is clear to the experienced clinician that direct visualization of a tumor and the surrounding anatomy can reveal valuable information not seen on CT or MRI scans. However, there is currently no way for the clinician to delineate the tumor volume on the endoscopic video and have that information placed correctly into the CT dataset used for treatment planning. Also, there is currently no way to view a combined CT/video dataset. Such a registration has not yet been accomplished in part because of the formidable problems of accurately registering a video taken during nasopharyngoscopy with a planning CT scan. In this proposal we will create a new method to register CT scans with endoscopic videos to produce a fused representation that can then displayed to the clinician to improve radiation treatment planning. To accomplish this, we will further develop and integrate methods of deformable registration, mechanical modeling, motion estimation, computer vision, and 3D interactive display. With such software, radiation treatment planning will have an entirely new and complementary source of information with which to determine tumor extent. Although outside the direct scope of this project, we believe that this technology can be extended to other parts of human anatomy and can be useful for surgical planning as well as radiation treatment planning. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop advanced image processing and display technologies and integrate them in such a way as to allow a clinician to simultaneously view fused internal photographs of the patient's throat and voice box along with the corresponding CT scans. Such a system will result in better tumor targeting for cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment of that part of the body. More accurate treatment will likely result in a highe cure rate for these cancers.",Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning,9477411,R01CA158925,"['Anatomy', 'Body part', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Endoscopy', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Larynx', 'Light', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motion', 'Nasopharyngoscopy', 'Nose', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Physical Examination', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Probability', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation induced damage', 'Radiation therapy', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Thinness', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'data structure', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'public health relevance', 'radiation risk', 'radiological imaging', 'software development', 'statistics', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,245857,0.04719227496238995
"Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI Project Abstract Motivation: This is a competing renewal of our successful project, Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI, R01 EB009690. MRI offers superb soft tissue contrast for children, without the ionizing radiation and cancer risk of CT. However, MRI use has been limited due to long exams, low spatial resolution, and motion-artifacts. Thus, MRI often requires prolonged anesthesia with breath-holds and attendant risk; hence, children often lack the beneﬁts of cross-sectional imaging altogether or are exposed to ionizing radiation. The previous project addressed these concerns by creating a dedicated pediatric imaging system. Highly par- allel, high-SNR 3T receive coil arrays were designed and constructed speciﬁcally for pediatric body imaging. The high SNR was used to accelerate scans reconstructed with a combination of parallel imaging, new mo- tion correction algorithms, compressed sensing (CS), and higher dimensional imaging. The resulting system is now being used extensively in clinical practice, signiﬁcantly reducing anesthesia depth and duration, and has markedly increased our MRI utilization. Key technologies have been or are now being commercialized with GE Healthcare, including the pediatric receive array, CS, 4D ﬂow, full-Fourier single-shot T2-weighted scanning, and coil compression. Siemens has licensed ﬁve of our patents, implemented them in work-in-progress packages, and productized our coil compression and our ESPIRiT coil sensitivity estimation. Philips has licensed three of our patents. This ensures broad impact. Approach: Despite signiﬁcant progress and reduced anesthesia depth and duration, patient cooperation re- mains the main limitation to eliminate anesthesia in all pediatric body MRI exams. Many children will cooperate for several minutes, but then ﬁdget and get out of the scanner. Others are content until acoustic noise agi- tates them. Therefore the major emphasis now is greater exam execution speed, comprehensive elimination of acoustic noise, and increased robustness, particularly to contrast agent injection. The project has three interrelated development aims, validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable fast 2D imag- ing for quiet T2 and quiet low-distortion diffusion weighted imaging. A second aim is to develop free-breathing 3D contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted imaging that is silent and motion-robust. The third aim will enable au- tomated, smart scanning to speed the exam execution and adaptive protocols to increase the exam robustness. The impact of all of these developments in the clinic will then be assessed to assess the resulting reduction of anesthesia. Signiﬁcance: This work will lead to fast, robust, broadly-applicable pediatric MRI protocols with less anes- thesia, making MRI safer, cheaper, and more available to children. MRI will be transformed into a workhorse modality, reducing CT radiation burden. The techniques will facilitate wide application in the community setting and permit new MRI applications, for both pediatric and adult diseases. Project Narrative Pediatric MRI often requires anesthesia. After considerable progress reducing the depth and duration of anes- thesia, this work aims to reduce the frequency of anesthesia through a synergistic combination of fast, quiet, motion-robust, automated, and adaptive scanning. This will make MRI safer, cheaper, and more widely available to children, reducing the population risk of radiation from CT.",Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI,9595406,R01EB009690,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Body Image', 'Body part', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Breathing', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational Technique', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Image Compression', 'Image Enhancement', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Legal patent', 'Letters', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatrics', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Speed', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'community setting', 'compliance behavior', 'contrast enhanced', 'design and construction', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'programs', 'radiation risk', 'reconstruction', 'skills', 'soft tissue', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,703347,0.03236336348752323
"Imaging of prostate cancer by combined quantitative ultrasound and acoustic-radiation-force-impulse imaging Project Summary/Abstract Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most-common cancer of men in the United States. The goal of the project is to develop a reliable, imaging tool for characterizing prostate tissue. This tool will improve detection, grading, treatment, and monitoring of PCa. It can be implemented in existing clinical scanners for effective needle-biopsy guidance and for planning and targeting focal therapy. Such a tool would significantly reduce the amount of unnecessary biopsies of noncancerous tissue and the current high rate of false negative diagnoses. It also would allow monitoring diagnosed PCa during watchful waiting or after non-surgical therapies. We propose to investigate the feasibility of fusing acoustic radiation-force impulse (ARFI) imaging and quantitative ultrasound (QUS) for typing prostate tissue. Studies to date have demonstrated encouraging performance of each ultrasonic modality when used alone. However, the ability of the combined modalities has not yet been investigated. The proposed project seeks to extract features from a retrospective data set containing radio-frequency (RF) ultrasound data acquired while performing in vivo prostate ARFI imaging. Images generated from both technologies are intrinsically perfectly registered. We will employ our well-established QUS-processing procedures to extract QUS-parameter maps from the RF-data and will develop and test new algorithms to extend the feature set from our established QUS-processing to incorporate ARFI image features. We will use standard and new features from QUS and ARFI for training linear and non-linear classifiers (e.g. support vector machines) to identify and image PCa. We will compare the performance of classifiers trained with QUS alone, ARFI alone, and MRI alone. Furthermore, we will assess performance improvement if classifiers are trained based on QUS- ARFI, QUS-MRI, ARFI-MRI, and QUS-ARFI-MRI parameter combinations and will determine the best classifier to detect prostate cancerous tissue using cross-validation and receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) statistics. If this project is successful, subsequent projects will focus on integrating the newly developed tools into clinical scanners. Project Narrative We propose to assess the feasibility of a novel tool for imaging and detection of prostate cancer (PCa) that combines quantitative ultrasound and acoustic radiation-force imaging. If our proposed method proves to be feasible and ultimately is successful, it will have a major impact on clinical practice by reducing the current high rates of false-negative diagnoses of PCa and by enabling non-invasive, low-risk, low-cost monitoring of PCa.",Imaging of prostate cancer by combined quantitative ultrasound and acoustic-radiation-force-impulse imaging,9510757,R03EB026233,"['Acoustics', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlas of Cancer Mortality in the United States', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancerous', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Intercept', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Prostate', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Publishing', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Relaxation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Screening for Prostate Cancer', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer classification', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'male', 'men', 'novel', 'patient population', 'quantitative ultrasound', 'radio frequency', 'routine imaging', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIBIB,RIVERSIDE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2018,77402,0.018018274632534886
"Fast and Robust Low-Dose X-Ray CT Image Reconstruction Abstract:  The use of CT scans has recently increased, for example, in virtual colonoscopy, CT cardiac screening, screening of the lung in smokers, whole-body CT in asymptomatic patients, and CT imaging of children. Shortening of the scanning time to around 1 second, eliminating the strict need for the subject to remain still or be sedated, is one of the main reasons for the large increase in the pediatric population. CT scans of children have been estimated to produce non-negligible increases in the probability of lifetime cancer mortality, leading to calls for the use of reduced current settings for CT scans of children. For these reasons, the CT industry has put in a lot of effort to develop low-dose CT. One active area of research is methods to reduce the radiation counts by applying adaptive collimation to block unnecessary x-ray photons. Another active area of research is the development of more robust image reconstruction algorithms that are less sensitive to noise for low-count data.  This grant proposal is focused on the second approach — development of fast and robust reconstruction algorithms. It is known that some iterative image reconstruction algorithms outperform the analytical filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm in terms of producing less-noisy images with the same data set. One disadvantage of these iterative algorithms is their long computation time, making them impractical in a real- world CT reconstruction tasks. For this reason, the FBP algorithm is still the main work horse for CT applications.  The main goal of the proposed research is to develop fast and robust iterative-algorithms so that their computation time is at the same order of an analytic FBP algorithm, using experimental low-dose phantom, cadaver data, and low-dose cancer screen chest CT patient data to perform comparison studies. We will answer the question: When the fast and robust algorithms are used, how much can the CT dose be reduced while retaining the image quality of a standard-dose CT produced by the conventional FBP?  This R15 project provides Weber State University (WSU) computer engineering and computer science students with hands-on opportunities and experiences of performing real-world research in the field of healthcare. It will stimulate the interests of students so that they consider a career in biomedical and bioengineering field/industry. Narrative:  CT dose is currently a major concern for the general public. Low-dose CT is under development. The proposed research will focus on developing fast, robust and practical image reconstruction methods that are able to produce a standard CT image using a lower CT dose.",Fast and Robust Low-Dose X-Ray CT Image Reconstruction,9440734,R15EB024283,"['Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cadaver', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cardiac', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Collimator', 'Computed Tomographic Colonography', 'Computer Hardware', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Equus caballus', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Inferior', 'Internships', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Photons', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Probability', 'Radiation', 'Radiation exposure', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'Smoker', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'career', 'chest computed tomography', 'clinical application', 'computer science', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'high risk', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'interest', 'low-dose spiral CT', 'lung cancer screening', 'mortality', 'parallel computer', 'professor', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'screening', 'tomography', 'university student']",NIBIB,WEBER STATE UNIVERSITY,R15,2018,88321,0.019732057815122113
"System-independent quantitative cardiac CT perfusion System-independent quantitative cardiac CT perfusion Summary BioInVision, Inc. and Case Western Reserve University researchers will develop software for quantitative anal- ysis of cardiac CT perfusion (CCTP), creating an important tool for evaluation of cardiovascular disease. With this product, cardiologists will be able to identify functional flow deficits in coronary artery territories. When one combines functional myocardial blood flow (MBF) with coronary anatomy from computed tomography angi- ography (CTA), it provides needed information on the physiologic significance of a stenosis. The CTA+CCTP combo could provide an ideal gateway exam for deciding whether to send a patient for percutaneous invasive coronary angiography and potential intervention (e.g., stenting). In addition, if flow is low and no stenosis is present, it will suggest microvascular disease, a very prevalent ailment of growing concern, especially among women and in diabetes. CT compares favorably to all other non-invasive cardiovascular imaging techniques (SPECT, PET, and MRI). It is available in many settings, including emergency departments. It provides both MBF and reliable coronary anatomy, not available in any other single modality. It has excellent resolution ena- bling detection of endocardial perfusion deficit, thought to be an early disease indicator that is impossible to assess with SPECT. CT is cheaper and has higher patient throughput than MRI or PET. With inclusion of MBF, CT would have an excellent opportunity to disrupt the diagnostic pathway leading to percutaneous intervention, a pathway now dominated by SPECT myocardial imaging, which includes zero information about coronary anatomy. To achieve reliable, accurate CT MBF measurements, we will invoke innovations to reduce beam hardening and to make reliable estimates of flow. Currently, CT perfusion is done on different CT machines with manufacturers’ proprietary software, using algorithms that can give erroneous MBFs. Applicable to any commercial scanner; our solution would harmonize measurements across acquisition systems providing trust- worthy, standardized measurements to clinicians, thereby improving management of cardiovascular patients. Narrative We will develop software to enable reliable evaluation of blood flow in heart tissue using CT imaging. With suc- cess, our project could lead to an improved gateway examination that could reduce unnecessary invasive cor- onary angiography, thereby reducing costs, patient discomfort, patient risk, and possibly unnecessary interven- tional therapies.",System-independent quantitative cardiac CT perfusion,9622204,R41HL144271,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Attention', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Calibration', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary artery', 'Cost Savings', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Family suidae', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inferior', 'Intervention', 'Iodine', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardium', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevalence', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Stents', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'blood flow measurement', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'cost', 'design', 'detector', 'digital', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'perfusion imaging', 'pre-clinical', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHLBI,"BIOINVISION, INC.",R41,2018,224240,0.062130529838730575
"New Approach to Quantitative Beta Amyloid Imaging Using PET Summary This project seeks to prove the commercial feasibility of a new approach to analyzing dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) data that would improve sensitivity, quantitative accuracy, and accessibility of imaging the biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent progress in understanding the nature of neurodegenerative diseases — especially evidence that the onset of cognitive symptoms of AD can be mitigated —amplify the critical need of improved quantitative evaluation of AD biomarkers. Dynamic PET may be the most accurate modality capable of achieving this goal. However, current strategies of analyzing dynamic PET images either require complex acquisition protocols with invasive arterial blood sampling procedures or rely on accuracy-degrading approximations such as compartment modeling. We have developed Intelligent Dynamics-Driven Quantitative Diagnostics (IDDQD), a novel processing approach based on factor analysis of dynamic structures with partial clustering used to initiate the process. We have shown that an early version of IDDQD can extract blood and tissue tracer dynamics and the corresponding spatial distributions from 11C-PIB PET scans. SolvingDynamics Inc plans to offer a Research-as-a-Service data processing workflow that will apply IDDQD to dynamic brain PET datasets acquired by the customers, producing accurate quantitative tracer dynamics time-activity curves (TACs) and the distribution of the targeted tissues, including the AD biomarkers beta-amyloid and tau. Our proprietary algorithm does not require the tracer dynamics model to achieve steady state, so a shorter scan can be used to generate results of similar or better accuracy than those produced by current approaches, such as reference tissue- based methods. In this proposal, SolvingDynamics seeks to prove the feasibility of our proposed approach by comparing the diagnostics obtained using IDDQD analysis of dynamic PET data and those obtained from independent measurements. A subcontract group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has been conducting dynamic 11C-PIB PET studies for several years and has accumulated over 70 cases with PET data matched to both cognitive-memory tests and to post-mortem pathology studies. SolvingDynamics will retrospectively apply its analysis technique to these datasets and compare its computed tissue distributions to standardized uptake volume ratio (SUVR) and distribution volume ratio (DVR) data. A subset of 20 dynamic 11C-PIB PET datasets ranging in length from 15 to 90 minutes will also be analyzed in order to validate the feasibility of reducing the imaging time. In addition, similar studies aimed at reducing imaging time with IDDQD will be performed for 20 PET scans acquired using 18F-AV1451 tracer to image tau. PROJECT NARRATIVE Positron emission tomography image analysis methodology to be validated in this project aims to improve sensitivity and specificity of tissue analysis in dynamic positron emission tomography, improving diagnosis of Alzheimer's diseases and other neurodegenerative disorders.

"Big data in acute renal rejection PROJECT SUMMARY  Background: Acute rejection of renal transplant, i.e., the immunological response of the human body to a foreign kidney, is the main cause of dysfunction in renal transplant patients, surpassing acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and immune drug toxicity. Over 650,000 patients in the US have end-stage renal disease and renal transplant offers the best outcome for these patients. However, 15%-27% of renal transplant patients have ARTR within 5 years, which if not detected and treated promptly, causes renal damage and leads to renal failure of the transplanted kidney. Currently, ARTR is initially evaluated using blood tests and urine sampling, e.g., plasma creatinine and creatinine clearance. However, these indices have low sensitivity, since a significant change in creatinine levels is only detectable after the loss of 60% of renal function. ARTR diagnosis requires renal biopsy (gold standard), which is invasive, takes a week for diagnosis, and costs up to $20,000. Further, needle biopsy is prone to over- or under-estimation of inflammation. The proposed study seeks to develop and validate a new noninvasive computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) software system that can provide highly accurate (over 97% accuracy) diagnosis of ARTR at an early stage by integrating laboratory-based biomarkers (e.g., creatinine clearance (CrCl) and serum plasma creatinine (SPCr)) with imaging-markers that will be extracted from either dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) or diffusion- weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI).  Objective/Hypotheses: The primary objective of this proposal is to develop and validate a clinically usable system for the early detection of acute renal transplant rejection (ARTR) based on testing the following three hypotheses: (i) The perfusion of the contrast agent in the cortex of the rejected kidney is slower than the perfusion of the contrast agent in the non-rejected kidney; (ii) The estimated apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in the cortex of the rejected kidney is smaller than the estimated ADC in the cortex of the non-rejected kidney; and (iii) Fusing laboratory-based biomarkers (e.g., CrCl and SPCr) with imaging-markers that will lead to novel fused indices for distinguishing rejected versus non-rejected kidneys in clinical decision-making.  Specific Aims: (i) Develop a software CAD system for early detection of acute renal transplant rejection based on integrating/fusing the estimated physiological perfusion parameters from DCE-MRI data with laboratory-based biomarkers for both rejected and non-rejected transplanted kidneys; (ii) Develop a software CAD system for early detection of acute renal transplant rejection based on integrating/fusing the estimated physiological diffusion parameters from DW-MRI data with laboratory-based biomarkers for both rejected and non-rejected transplanted kidneys; and (iii) Evaluate the accuracy of the proposed image analysis software system with clinical data that will be collected at University of Louisville (Approved IRB # 16.0041), University of Michigan (Approved IRB # HUM00115031), and the collected MRI data at The Kidney transplant center at Mansoura University with local regulatory approval.  Study Design: We will develop the following image analysis techniques to accurately analyze both DCE- MRI and DW-MRI: (i) segmentation of the kidney object from the surrounding abdominal structures for either DCE-MRI or DW-MRI using appearance and prior shape models; (ii) a Laplace-based non-rigid registration approach to handle local deformations in the kidney region caused by physiological effects (e.g., intrinsic pulsatile effects, breathing, or transmitted effects from adjacent structures, such as the bowel) during the data collection; (iii) segmentation of the kidney cortex and generation of either the physiological perfusion parameters (e.g., wash-in slope, wash-out slope, time-to-peak, and peak value) or physiological diffusion parameters (e.g., ADC); (iv) classification of the acute rejection versus non-rejection kidney status and evaluating the method as a diagnostic test; and (v) depiction of parametric maps of the estimated perfusion or diffusion indices to help clinical visual assessment of the transplanted kidney. The MRI and clinical data will be obtained from patients who have undergone kidney transplantation from live donors, and are available to our research team via Dr. Beache and Dr. Dwyer (Radiology Department and The Kidney Transplant Center at the University of Louisville, respectively) and Dr. Samaniego-Picota (Director of the Kidney Transplant Program and the Transplant Ambulatory Care Unit at the University of Michigan). In addition to the data that will be collected at the University of Louisville and the University of Michigan, our group has access to MRI data that had been collected from an additional 100 subjects at Mansoura University Hospital, Egypt. This data is available to our group through Dr. Abou El-Ghar, one of the PI collaborators, and it will be used to test the proposed CAD system on the data collected from another geographical area. Our preliminary diagnostic results, based on analysis of DCE-MRI data from 54 independent in-vivo cases using leave-one-subject-out approach were 98% accurate (sensitivity = 100.00%, specificity = 96%, and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) = 98%). Moreover, our preliminary results, based on the analysis of DW-MRI data from 75 independent in-vivo cases using leave-one-subject-out were 97% accurate (sensitivity = 98%, specificity = 96%, and DSC = 98%). These results demonstrate the potential of the proposed CAD system to complement current technologies such as nuclear imaging and ultrasonography to determine the type of kidney dysfunction post transplantation.

"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart transplant (Tx) surgery is a well-established life-saving procedure, but is associated with post- interventional risks such as acute cardiac rejection (ACR) which is one of the leading causes of death in the first year after transplant. Beyond the first year, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the single greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality. Monitoring the patient for post-transplant events is thus paramount. The standard monitoring strategy, however, relies on frequent (12-16 monitoring nodes during year 1 alone) invasive and costly procedures including endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) and catheter angiography. Since EMB and catheter angiography have limited sensitivity due to sampling errors (ACR) or the diffuse nature of the disease (CAV), a reliable non-invasive alternative for the early detection of ACR and CAV would be desirable to reduce the need for invasive procedures, improve sensitivity, and reduce cost. We have recently developed and applied cardiac MRI techniques for the non-invasive assessment of myocardial edema (T2-mapping), diffuse fibrosis (pre- and post-contrast T1-mapping), myocardial velocities (tissue phase mapping), and microvascular quantitative perfusion. We have shown that these techniques can identify distinct regional structural and functional alterations in the heart that correlate with te status of the allograft. Based on these findings, a detailed cost-effective analysis using Markov modeling and decision tree analysis has demonstrated that cardiac MR has tremendous potential to reduce monitoring costs by 40-50% during the first year after Tx alone. This proposal builds on these promising findings and our aim is to develop an new 15-minute structure-function cardiac MRI protocol for the improved detection regional abnormalities associated with ACR (edema, fibrosis, dysfunction) and CAV (perfusion, dysfunction). Integration of MRI with echocardiography and intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) will provide unique multi-modality assessment of the allograft. The application in a longitudinal clinical study coupled with state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis will allow redefining the most effective post-Tx mixed monitoring strategy. The aim is to to help clinicians identify the optimal mixed monitoring strategy, i.e. the optimal combination of multi-modality imaging (structure-function MRI, echo, IVUS) and invasive procedures (EMB, catheter angiography) which provide best outcome (quality adjusted life days) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop a multi-modality imaging protocol for the non-invasive characterization of tissue and function of the left and right heart in patients after heart transplantation. Our aim is to develop a new non- invasive 15 minute diagnostic test in order to provide a previously unattainable quantitative characterization of myocardial structure-function deficits in cardiac transplant patients. The application in a longitudinal clinial study coupled with cost-effectiveness analysis and decision tree modeling will allow to improve current monitoring strategies by combining cardiac MRI, echocardiography, intravascular ultrasound and invasive tests (biopsy, catheter angiography) to provide the best outcome (quality of life days, mortality) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient.",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,9417961,R01HL117888,"['Acute', 'Allografting', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost utility', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrosis', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Myocardial', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling Errors', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'base', 'comparative cost effectiveness', 'cost', 'extracellular', 'follow-up', 'heart allograft', 'heart function', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'post intervention', 'procedure cost', 'public health relevance', 'standard of care', 'two-arm study']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,658634,0.04028235476022135
"Quantitative Low-Dose PET Imaging Project summary Quantitative PET has become increasingly important in clinical management and research, in particular for predicting and assessing response to therapy for cancer patients. Current PET protocols involve injection of PET tracers that typically result in ~6-7 mSv radiation dose to patients. For patients who require multiple repeated PET scans to monitor the response to therapy, and for patients who need PET scans with two or more tracers (e.g., FDG + FLT) to optimally predict response to therapy, it is critical to reduce the radiation dose from the PET tracer injection, while still maintaining the quantitative accuracy and image quality for cancer management. When reducing injection dose, the PET images will have higher noise due to fewer detected counts, which will subsequently introduce errors in quantitative measurements. For moving organs and tumors such as those in the lung and abdomen, respiratory motion can substantially degrade quantitative accuracy, so motion correction is required. Conventional motion correction uses a gating strategy that rebins the PET data, resulting in substantially higher noise in each gate. More advanced methods incorporate motion vector estimation in the image domain for post-registration or motion compensated image reconstruction using all detected events without increasing noise. The motion vectors need to be derived from gated PET, which are even noisier when using a reduced tracer injection in low-dose studies, imposing substantial challenges for accurate and reliable voxel-by-voxel motion vector estimation. In dynamic PET studies with clinical cardiac tracers and other novel oncology and neurology tracers, quantification is even more challenging for low-dose PET as each dynamic frame only contains a small fraction of detected events so the high image noise will affect the determination of image-derived input functions and can lead to bias and high noise in parametric images. In this project, to reduce image noise and maintain quantitative accuracy in PET, we propose to develop, optimize, and evaluate multiple innovative imaging methods for low-dose PET data to achieve comparable quantitative accuracy as full-dose PET. While the imaging developments are generally applicable to all PET tracers in oncology, neurology, and cardiology, since cancer is the primary clinical application of PET, we will focus our investigation and optimization in this project on three lung cancer imaging tracers at different clinical adoption stages as examples: 1) 18F-FDG as a routine clinical tracer, 2) 18F-FMISO for hypoxia studies as a tracer for human research, and 3) 18F-PD-L1 that specifically binds to human PD-L1 in tumors and other organs as a recent first-in-human tracer.

"Automated coronary artery calcification scoring for cardiovascular risk screening ABSTRACT The World Health Organization lists cardiovascular disease as the most common cause of death worldwide at 31% of all deaths. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring has become the most reliable predictor of future coronary artery disease (CAD) events in the asymptomatic population. CAC scores are currently only reported on ECG-gated CT examinations that are ordered when the primary indication is cardiac in nature. However, in 2007 there were 7.1 million non-cardiac thoracic CT scans ordered with lungs as the primary indication where CAC scores could have been reported. An additional 7-10 million CT lung screening scans are expected to be ordered per year as lung screening programs grow. Because lung cancer risk factors and CAD risk factors overlap significantly, most these patients could benefit greatly from having their CAC score reported as part of their non-cardiac CT examination. This could dramatically improve decision making, quality of care, and lower expenses due to future CAD interventions and cardiac specific CT scans. The goal of this project is to develop a fully automated software application that can report CAC scores on both gated and ungated thoracic CT scans with seamless integration into the Radiology workflow. A successful completion of this project will deliver a product capable of dramatically increasing the number of people that receive early intervention for CAD, thereby increasing quality of care and lowering costs. This Phase I application proposes first creating an algorithm capable of automatically calculating global CAC scores from both ECG-gated and ungated CT scans using CAC segmentations performed by an expert physician. If successful, the Phase II project will perform robust clinical validation adequate for an FDA 510(k) submission.

"Multidimensional MRI-based Big Data Analytics to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This “Pathway to Independence” award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position. Ultimately, she aims to become a faculty member in a radiology or bioengineering institute, where she can further research technical biomedical imaging and machine learning developments applied to the musculoskeletal system.

"Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Abstract: Fast, reliable and accurate delineation of pelvic organs in the planning and treatment images is a long- standing, important and technically challenging problem. Its solution is highly required for state-of-the-art image-guided radiation therapy planning and treatment, as better treatment decisions rely on timely interpretation of anatomical information in the images. However, automatic segmentation in male pelvic regions is always difficult due to 1) low contrast between prostate and surrounding organs, and 2) possibly disparate shapes/appearances of bladder and rectum caused by tissue deformations. The goal of this project is to create a set of novel machine learning tools to achieve accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (e.g., prostate, bladder, and rectum) in different modalities (e.g., planning CT, treatment CT/CBCT, and MRI) for radiotherapy of prostate cancer.  Planning CT. For automatic segmentation, landmark detection is often the first step in rapidly locating the target organs. Thus, in Aim 1, we will create a novel joint landmark detection approach, based on both random forests and auto-context model, to iteratively detect all landmarks and further coordinate their detection results for achieving more accurate and consistent landmark detection results. After roughly locating organs with the aid of those detected landmarks, the second step is to accurately segment boundaries of target organs in the planning CT. Accordingly, in Aim 2, we will create a set of learning methods to a) first simultaneously predict all pelvic organ boundaries in the planning CT with the regression forests trained by labeled training data, and b) then segment all pelvic organs jointly by deforming their respective shape models. In particular, to address the limitations of conventional deformable models in assuming simple Gaussian distributions for organ shapes, a novel hierarchical sparse shape composition approach will be developed to constrain shape models during deformable segmentation.  Treatment CT/CBCT. During the course of serial radiation treatments, to quantitatively record and monitor the accumulated dose delivered to the patient, organs in the treatment image also need to be segmented. Although methods proposed in Aims 1-2 can be simply applied, as done by many conventional methods, this will lead to a) inconsistent landmark detection and b) inconsistent segmentations across different treatment days because of possible large shape/appearance changes. Accordingly, in Aim 3, we will create a novel self- learning mechanism to gradually learn and incorporate patient-specific information into both joint landmark detection and deformable segmentation steps from the increasingly acquired treatment images of patient. Thus, population data will gradually be replaced by the patient's own data to train personalized models.  MRI. To guide pelvic organ segmentation in the planning CT, MRI is now often acquired for selected patients. To this end, in Aim 4, we will develop a) a prostate MRI segmentation method by using deep learning to learn MRI-specific features for guiding landmark detection and deformable segmentation as proposed in Aims 1-2; b) a novel collaborative MRI and CT segmentation algorithm for more accurate segmentation of planning CT.  All our developed algorithms will be evaluated for their performance in clinical (treatment planning and delivery) workflow for 130 patients in UNC Cancer Hospital and also hospitals of our consultants.  Benefit for Patient Care. Development of these segmentation tools will 1) dramatically accelerate the clinical workflow, 2) reduce workload (i.e., manual interaction time) for physicians, and 3) lead to better patient outcomes with reliable and accurate segmentations of target area and critical organs. Although these tools cannot replace the expertise of physicians, they can be of great assistance to physicians. Narrative Description of Project This project aims to create a set of novel machine learning tools for accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (such as prostate, bladder, and rectum) in various imaging modalities to help radiotherapy of prostate cancer. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel joint landmark detection and boundary prediction framework for accurate segmentation of the planning CT images, 2) an innovative updating mechanism for incorporating patient-specific information from previous treatment images of same patient to progressively improve treatment CT/CBCT segmentation, and 3) a deep-learning based framework for learning MRI-specific features for prostate MRI segmentation, as well as a novel method for collaborative MRI & planning CT segmentation. We will validate these methods on real patients in our clinical workflow. Besides, although these machine-learning tools are designed for radiotherapy of prostate cancer, they can also be easily extended to other new organs and new modalities after appropriate updating and training.",Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment,9336855,R01CA206100,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Hospital', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rectum', 'Sample Size', 'Shapes', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Update', 'Workload', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'design', 'dosage', 'forest', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'novel', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment duration', 'treatment planning']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,347700,0.0459081079975369
"Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. The goal of this proposal is to develop and provide a new analysis technique for understanding the complex cardiac motion patterns (in time and space) of patients with cardiac dyssynchrony, with the hope of improving its treatment outcomes, specifically with respect to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). CRT, the most effective treatment for dyssynchrony with worsening heart failure, significantly improves outcome in only ~66% of heart failure patients selected for the treatment, which is based on ECG criteria. Selection criteria based on imaging are essential to improving the success rate. Unfortunately, response rates are not higher with selection criteria based on echocardiography, the most popular cardiac imaging technique. Cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has the potential to better characterize dyssynchrony, as it shows cardiac mechanics and intramural wall motion with much higher spatial resolution than echocardiography. However, quantitative assessments of CMR have been mostly limited to global volumetric measures, which ignore most of the motion information captured by the images. For example, studies of a number of distinctive motion features of dyssynchrony (such as septal flash and apical rocking) have been confined to qualitative assessment, limiting inference of their potential utility for improving CRT treatment. To accurately quantify cardiac function through CMR, we have developed biomechanical models for describing cardiac function and machine learning technology for identifying morphological and functional patterns atypical for healthy hearts. We propose to combine these two technologies to accurately quantify cardiac dyssynchrony within the Left Ventricle (LV). Specifically, our methods will extract a rich description of LV motion and strain from the CMRs of a set of retrospectively selected subjects with synchronous or dyssynchronous LV motion. We will then use machine learning methods to identify local and global motion patterns specific to dyssynchrony. Finally, we will correlate these patterns to already existing clinical scores to find potentially predictive markers with respect to CRT outcome. We hypothesize that these markers will have a higher correlation to CRT outcome than current clinical markers alone. Identifying these markers will have the potential to further stratify the disease with respect to the expected outcome of CRT, which then can be used to derive new selection criteria that lead to higher success rates. The project will also disseminate our novel, data-driven methodology for quantifying that motion. Other research groups can apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases impacting LV motion in general. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy, as the current clinical selection criteria are too broad. Our goal is to more accurately characterize the complex shape and motion patterns of cardiac dyssynchrony, through new machine learning technology applied to dynamic cardiovascular magnetic resonance images. We envision that our findings would further improve both our understanding of cardiac dyssynchrony in relation to heart failure and the ability to predict its response to resynchronization therapy, potentially leading to new clinical guidelines and improved clinical outcomes.",Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony,9281894,R01HL127661,"['Apical', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Selection Criteria', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiac resynchronization therapy', 'cardiovascular visualization', 'effective therapy', 'heart motion', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'tool']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2017,593963,0.04079959377985678
"Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calcium scoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in the asymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surrounding the heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due to the absence of robust, automated quantification methods.  We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robust quantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a new integrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in two existing, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, late revascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) and the St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To develop and evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of new computational algorithms for automated quantification of EAT measures; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified EAT features, relative to atherosclerotic plaque burden and measures of obesity, for the prediction of future cardiac events in asymptomatic patients in the EISNER registry and the St. Francis Heart Study; 3) To derive and evaluate a new, integrated risk score—combining standard risk factors, coronary calcium score and EAT measures using machine learning—for the prediction of future cardiac events in the EISNER registry, and further, to additionally evaluate this risk score externally in the St. Francis Heart Study patient cohort.  This work in this proposal will provide a novel, personalized paradigm that will objectively and accurately identify asymptomatic patients undergoing coronary calcium scanning who are at increased risk for future cardiac events, without any additional imaging or risk to the patient. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) CT scanning of the heart for coronary calcium scoring is a simple, widely-used, low-cost test with low radiation dose. Using these scans, the researchers propose to establish automated analysis of fat which surrounds the heart, as well as novel computerized scores that identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack. This new research will allow doctors to better identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to avoid a heart attack or sudden cardiac death.",Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events,9310380,R01HL133616,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational algorithm', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early identification', 'Event', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Institution', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Interleukin-6', 'Language', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Reader', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Visceral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'pericardial sac', 'predictive marker', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'routine imaging', 'sudden cardiac death']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,653101,0.023825428910864244
"Simultaneous imaging of myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism using dynamic 18F-FDG PET ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ischemic cardiomyopathy affects approximately 3 million people in the United States. This form of heart failure is the result of myocardial infarcton or severe coronary heart disease that reduces the viability and function of the heart. Ischemic cardiomyopathy is associated with poor long-term survival when patients with viable myocardium are not revascularized. By imaging myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism and seeking flow-metabolism mismatches, positron emission tomography (PET) method has been established as the gold standard of assessing myocardial viability for selecting patients who can benefit most from surgical revascularization. Current PET method employs two separate static scans with two different radiotracers for generation of the flow-metabolism image pair. While the image of glucose metabolism is acquired using the most widely used radiotracer 18F- fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), myocardial blood flow imaging with the radiotracer 13N-ammonia or rubidium-82 suffers from limited clinical availability. In addition, the imaging protoco of two separate imaging sessions is time consuming and resource intensive. As a result, myocardial viability via PET is currently under-utilized in clinic despite its high accuracy and th fast-growing installation of PET/CT scanners in the past decade. In this project, we propose to develop a novel PET method for myocardial viability assessment that only uses a single injection of FDG without the need of a flow- specific radiotracer. We hypothesize that myocardial blood flow can be derived from the quantitative kinetic parameters of dynamic FDG PET. We will develop a new multi-variable prediction model using statistical machine learning to predict myocardial blood flow from dynamic FDG PET data. We will also develop a shortened dynamic FDG PET protocol to improve practicality. This innovation will provide the flow-metabolism image pair for myocardial viability assessment in a clinically favorable time, cost and with reduced radiation dose. Success of this research will make PET assessment of myocardial viability more widely available in clinic with easier access, lower radiation dose, cheaper imaging cost and shorter clinical visit time as compared with conventional two-session protocols, thus improving our clinical practice of treating ischemic cardiomyopathy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a gold standard method for detecting viable myocardium to select which patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy to benefit most from surgical revascularization. Its use in clinic, however, is under-utilized because of the limited clinical availability of the radiotracers needed. This research aims to develop a novel PET imaging method for assessment of myocardial viability that can be easily accessed in clinic with reduced lower radiation dose and imaging cost without compromising imaging performance.",Simultaneous imaging of myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism using dynamic 18F-FDG PET,9251317,R21HL131385,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Ammonia', 'Blood', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Cyclotrons', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dose', 'Echocardiography', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Investments', 'Kinetics', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rubidium', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Tracer', 'United States', 'Visit', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'glucose metabolism', 'glucose transport', 'heart function', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'ischemic cardiomyopathy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'public health relevance', 'radiotracer', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'success', 'uptake']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2017,195625,0.07447127316280094
"High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before a heart attack, and predict risk in millions of patients annually. This is currently limited by the need fo visual interpretation, which is highly variable and depends on the physician's experience. The long-term objective of this program is to improve the interpretation of this widely used heart imaging technique-achieving higher accuracy for disease detection than it is possible by the best attainable visual analysis. This proposal builds on our prior work in conventional myocardial MPS, and focuses on fast, low-radiation MPS imaging (fast-MPS) obtained by new high-efficiency scanners. Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS. The algorithms will include better heart muscle detection by training with correlated anatomical data and a novel approach for mapping the probability of abnormal perfusion for each location of the heart muscle; 2) enhance the diagnosis of heart disease from fast-MPS by machine- learning algorithms that integrate clinical data, stress test parameters, and quantitative image features; 3) demonstrate the clinical utility of the new algorithms applied to automatic canceling of the rest portion of the MPS scan, when not needed. The new system will be more accurate than the clinical expert analysis in the detection of obstructive coronary disease. By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,9282634,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collimator', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Stress Tests', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical imaging', 'computer generated', 'cost', 'detector', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'solid state', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,600120,0.0169023401268334
"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning.

"Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma Glioblastoma is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Despite advances in neurosurgical resection, radiation targeting, and chemotherapy, the prognosis remains grim with a median survival of just 15 months. The effectiveness of current radiation therapy strategies is severely limited by shortcomings in the imaging modalities used to develop treatment plans. Current radiation therapy planning is mainly based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, which identifies high grade tumors that are immediately associated with leaky neovasculature. Although it is an excellent diagnostic tool to identify high grade from low grade tumors, it is unable to signal occult infiltration beyond the core of the tumor. Though many believe GBM to be an incurable disease, we believe we have identified a method for optimizing tumor targeting that will increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy. A significant component of the current problem in GBM therapy is the lack of treatment for non-enhancing regions that are significantly infiltrated by neoplastic glioma cells without neovascularization. This untreated population undoubtedly leads to early recurrence. The proposed study addresses an important step toward translating an advanced quantitative imaging modality that complements the conventional imaging that is capable of reliably revealing glioma- infiltrated regions for precise, personalized treatment targeting. Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an alternative modality able to identify endogenous metabolism within tissue without the need for exogenous contrast, and has been shown to identify the metabolic abnormalities associated with tumor beyond the regions identified by T1-weighted MRI. The clinical integration of sMRI in patient management has been limited due to the computational challenges of analysis of sMRI data. Two key hurdles to be overcome are the insufficiency of filters to remove image artifacts and the necessity of quantification of metabolic levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism. As a result, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and many hours of computational and user time. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in radiation therapy planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning, an approach to computation that has shattered benchmarks in many medical and non-medical problems. Specifically, we will develop filters for removing artifacts, algorithms for personalized diagnosis of tumor infiltration, and explore deep learning as a method to synthesize sMRI data with anatomical and clinical metrics in a fully automated fashion. Success in the proposed work will produce a “scanner-to-clinician” platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into the clinical radiation therapy planning paradigm. Ultimately, we believe this additional modality in the physician's tool belt will lead to better outcomes in patients suffering from this debilitating disease. Project Narrative  Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is a molecular imaging modality that can accurately detect abnormalities in the metabolic signatures of tumor cells, making it ideal for the detection and monitoring of highly infiltrative brain tumors like glioblastoma. Clinical adoption of sMRI has been slow due to limited tools for expedient and objective processing of sMRI data into information that oncologists can use for therapy planning. This proposal addresses these challenges using recent advances in high performance computing and machine learning to develop a software framework for using sMRI in the clinical management of patients with glioblastoma.",Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma,9312109,F30CA206291,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Excision', 'Gaussian model', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Infiltration', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Neoplasms', 'Oncologist', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Framework', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'contrast enhanced', 'dosage', 'expectation', 'genomic data', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning network', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'metabolic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'neoplastic', 'neoplastic cell', 'neovascularization', 'neovasculature', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'software development', 'spectroscopic data', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'syntax', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'white matter']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F30,2017,49044,-0.0045409878279028355
"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more. This will be accomplished by: optimizing the image processing that is used, further developing new and better image processing methods, and developing a method of ""personalized imaging"", in which, for each individual patient, the minimum amount of imaging agent needed to obtain a good image is computed.",Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging,9268035,R01HL122484,"['3D ultrasound', '4D Imaging', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Protection', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radioactive', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'computer program', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging agent', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'perfusion imaging', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2017,770494,0.04689401739310822
"Area B:  Multi-Tracer Volumetric PET (MTV-PET) to Measure Tumor Glutamine and Glucose Metabolic Rates in a Single Imaging Session Precision oncology places an increased demand on cancer diagnostics to characterize tumors at the time of diagnosis. Tissue diagnostics for precision oncology increasingly rely on multi-valent assays to characterize cancer biology and identify therapeutic targets. The power of molecular imaging for cancer diagnosis has been well demonstrated by [18F]fluorodexoyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET/CT), widely used in clinical oncology. PET tracers targeted to facets of tumor biology now enable multi-valent molecular imaging to identify therapeutic targets. Early studies show that combined tracer studies, commonly FDG plus a target- specific tracer, are highly predictive of tumor response to targeted therapy. However, emissions from different PET tracers are indistinguishable to a PET scanner, requiring separate imaging sessions on separate days for multiple 18F-based tracers (~ 2 hour half-life) in the same patient. This limits the clinical practicality of multi-tracer PET, and fails to exploit the full power of multi-tracer PET to quantify tumor in vivo biology and biologic heterogeneity for highly variable process such as cancer metabolism. We will overcome this limitation by taking advantage of recent developments in volumetric PET scanners, fast reconstruction, and 4D image analysis methods from our laboratories to develop Multi-Tracer Volumetric PET (MTV-PET) to generate multi-valent, quantitative biologic parametric images for two or more tracers in a single session to guide precision oncology and translational cancer biology research. As such, our proposed technology development project addresses a need, described under Priority Area B for “new capabilities for advancing precise clinical diagnosis of cancer patients”. Using methods developed in our laboratories, we now propose to integrate and enhance these methodologies to develop and validate Multi-Tracer Volumetric PET (MTV-PET) to generate quantitative biologic parametric images for two or more tracers in a single session. We will develop and test this approach for simultaneous glucose and glutamine metabolism imaging, with the goal of guiding metabolism-targeted therapy such as inhibitors of glutaminase (GLS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The project will focus on the technology developments (largely computational) that enable multi-tracer imaging. Ongoing and separately funded work on clinical studies will acquire data from two separate imaging PET sessions using current technology and will provide data for method development. We will first optimize tracer dose timing, image reconstruction, and image time binning for dual tracer MTV-PET (Aim 1), followed by implementation and technical validation of image analysis using a mixture analysis approach (Aim 2). This will set the stage for technical validation of MTV-PET (Aim 3) and an exploratory aim (Aim 4) testing image analytics based on machine learning. Successful completion of our technology development will yield a new method for multi-tracer PET that would change the landscape for cancer imaging diagnostic biomarker and precision oncology research, consistent with goals of RFA-CA-17-023 Priority Area B.

"Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology using 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography Each year, 735,000 Americans have an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), and approximately 120,000 die from it. Heart attacks occur most commonly due to rupture of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries. Despite this, current diagnostic and treatment algorithms make no allowance for the assessment of disease activity and currently all patients with atherosclerosis are treated in a similar manner. This failure to differentiate stable from active disease may result in potentially unnecessary or insufficient therapies. In a breakthrough series of studies, our co-investigators discovered that positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-sodium- fluoride (18F-NaF; an inexpensive and widely available tracer approved by Food and Drug Administration) can readily identify plaque rupture and increased coronary plaque activity. We propose to build further on this success, by addressing several important remaining limitations that prevent us from translating this technology to broad clinical use. The limitations include complicated and subjective image analysis, underutilization of the concomitant coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) for plaque characterization, inability to utilize prior CTA for the analysis of 18F-NaF PET, lack of methods to integrate all available PET and CTA data and significant motion of the coronaries during the PET scan. We propose a multi-faceted approach to automate and improve coronary 18F-NaF PET imaging by full integration with CTA and correction for cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion. The overall goal of the proposal is to optimize the measurement of disease activity in coronary atherosclerosis using integrated 18F-NaF PET/CTA imaging, with the opportunity to validate this development against clinical outcome in a “real-world” multicenter patient study. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: 1) to integrate quantification of CTA and PET image data 2) to develop new methods for simultaneous correction of cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion for coronary PET, and 3) to clinically evaluate new methods in a multicenter clinical trial (separately funded and already underway), further refining risk prediction for heart attacks with integrated PET+CTA risk score derived by machine learning. This work will lead to a robust and reproducible clinical method for stratification of patients for risk of heart attacks, with potential to be applied for the identification of patients who would most benefit from expensive, and potentially risky treatments. Our techniques could also be used in future clinical trials to test the efficacy of novel therapies. Moreover, the new analysis will be applicable to other PET tracers that may be developed to investigate other pathological processes in the coronary vasculature. The resulting software will be shared with clinical institutions performing coronary PET to facilitate standardization and automation of this novel plaque imaging technique. NARRATIVE A heart attack, a major cause of death, is most commonly caused by rupture of deposits in heart vessels, leading to sudden blockage of the blood flow in the vessels and disruption of blood supply to the heart muscle. Currently there is no reliable test to identify deposits at the highest risk of rupture, but in a recent scientific breakthrough, positron emission tomography has demonstrated capability to image disease activity inside these deposits, linked to their rupture; this technique, however, is currently hampered by lack of anatomical reference, image blurring due to heart motion, and variability of manual analysis. We propose to address these problems by developing automatic software that precisely integrates anatomical and biological information and virtually “freezes” vessel motion, validating this new approach in a large “real-world” multicenter patient study.",Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography,9382827,R01HL135557,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Blood flow', 'Breast Microcalcification', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Failure', 'Fluorides', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammation', 'Institution', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Translating', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'coronary computed tomography angiography', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'heart motion', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'success', 'uptake', 'virtual']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,771431,0.06703833209830713
"Development of automated web-based spectroscopic MRI clinical interface Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Infiltration of glioma cells into surrounding normal brain make curative surgical resection of GBM impossible, and almost all will eventually recur. Thus, extraordinary significance is placed on radiation therapy (RT) strategies, which have been shown to be effective, but require strong imaging evidence to guide RT planning. Currently employed clinical imaging modalities include T1-weighted contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI, which only identifies leaky neovasculature associated with high grade tumor, and T2-weighted MRI, which is not specific for tumor infiltration. Through advances in neurosurgery, it is now possible to achieve complete or near-complete resection of the CE tumor component in many cases; thus, the region that is treated with the highest RT dose is limited to the empty resection cavity plus a small margin. Due to the generally larger size of the T2 area and unknown status of disease, it is treated to a lesser “microscopic disease” dose. Many times, however, this microscopic disease dose is inadequate to control the tumor. Spectroscopic MR imaging (sMRI) provides a highly sensitive and specific means of identifying these regions, although sMRI has not yet seen use in RT planning due to a lack of clinical decision support software for the analysis, display, and management of sMRI data. Three key hurdles to be overcome are: 1) lack of an automatic, fast and reliable method for spectral quality control; 2) the necessity of quantification of metabolite levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism; and 3) a clinician- friendly display of the sMRI spectra encoded as a high-resolution, continuous, 3D image set for direct registration and incorporation into the RT planning process. Currently, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and shepherding data between several tools, resulting in a complex workflow that takes hours and is impractical for routine use in a fast-paced clinical RT environment. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to radiation oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in RT planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning. Specifically, we will develop algorithmic filters for identifying (and eliminating) spectral artifacts, algorithms for personalized localization of tumor infiltration, and methods and interfaces for the volumetric display of sMRI data needed for RT planning and review. Success in the proposed work will produce an automated “scanner-to-clinician” platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into routine clinical applications. This tool will also be highly valuable in the MRS-based diagnosis and evaluation of numerous other neuropathologies, including other primary (and metastatic) brain tumors, stroke, multiple sclerosis (and other demyelinating diseases), inborn errors of metabolism, and neurodegenerative diseases. Project Narrative There is widespread agreement that MR spectroscopy can provide valuable information without the need for exogenous contrast agents, however the software tools needed to incorporate whole brain 3D spectroscopic MRI (sMRI) into clinical practice are lacking. We plan to develop a web-based sMRI clinical interface for the analysis, visualization and integration of sMRI data into patient management. This “scanner-to-clinician” platform is designed to provide quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis in order to integrate sMRI into the routine radiation therapy planning process. In addition, this user-friendly tool will be highly valuable in the sMRI-based diagnosis and evaluation of numerous other neuropathologies aside from cancer, including other primary (and metastatic) brain tumors, stroke, multiple sclerosis (and other demyelinating diseases), inborn errors of metabolism, and neurodegenerative diseases.",Development of automated web-based spectroscopic MRI clinical interface,9332618,R21NS100244,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Demyelinating Diseases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'High-LET Radiation', 'Hour', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Inborn Errors of Metabolism', 'Infiltration', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mainstreaming', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Neoplasms', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Oncologist', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Software Framework', 'Software Tools', 'Stroke', 'Surgically-Created Resection Cavity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Water', 'Work', 'anatomic imaging', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'contrast enhanced', 'design', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'expectation', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'innovation', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'neovasculature', 'neuropathology', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'software development', 'spectroscopic data', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,233258,-0.004441882926054333
"Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During medical imaging, patient motion is virtually unavoidable presenting a significant source of image degradation and artifacts, which in turn, can impact the quality of care received by many patients. One method used to address patient motion is to employ visual tracking systems (VTS), which involves placing a small number of reflective markers on the patient that can be located and tracked in 3D space using stereo cameras. The tracked markers can then be used as a surrogate to a structure of interest, such as the heart. The tracked surrogate provides a quantifiable measure that can be directly correlated with the motion of the target structure, which can then be used for prospective or retrospective motion correction. However, the markers add complexity to patient workflow, provide only a sparse sampling of the patient's surface, and the optimal number and placement of markers is unknown. This project addresses the shortcomings of marker-based VTS systems by proposing to develop and test a novel low-cost marker-less VTS system for tracking patient motion within a hybrid imaging system. The primary barrier for successfully tracking the patient's body surface using marker-less VTS is that clothing prevents an unobstructed view of the patient's body. The candidate, Dr. Lindsay, is proposing to incorporate a translational method using computational approaches to compensate for garments within the proposed marker-less VTS system. Dr. Lindsay has received training in computer science and computer vision and previously has focused on the computational aspects of capturing, modeling, and rendering of physical phenomena such as light and is proposing to extend this knowledge to the medical imaging field. Dr. Lindsay's goals for this proposal are to acquire the necessary training and skills that will allow him to translate his expertise and existing computational skills to an area f research with medical relevance: namely, detecting and tracking patient motion for the purpose of improving motion correction for hybrid- imaging. Dr. Lindsay's long-term career goal is to become an accomplished independent investigator focusing on solving significant problems in medical imaging by translating advances in Computer Science. The proposed work will take place the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (UMass) in Worcester, MA under the primary mentorship of Dr. Michael King, an internationally known expert in the area of medical imaging and medical physics in Nuclear Medicine. Drs. Gennert, Sullivan, Licho have expertise in computer vision, mechanical engineering and medical imaging, and radiology and Nuclear Medicine, respectively will also serve as co-mentors.  The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) develop a novel marker-less VTS, which we call PT- Cam, using low-cost using state-of-the-art camera technology, 2) model surface motion as a surrogate for internal motion of the heart, and 3) conduct tests of the PT-Cam system, in order to determine the acceptability and feasibility of clinical usage, on patients undergoing clinical MPI PET/CT imaging. Thus, the main objective of this program of research is to develop a clinically viable method for motion tracking patients undergoing hybrid-imaging studies by using a novel marker-less surface-tracking method that can compensate for clothing and provide modeling of interior motion of structures from surface tracking. If successful, not only will this project provide an innovative, marker-less VTS system for low-cost surface tracking for motion compensation during hybrid imaging but it will also give the candidate the necessary training needed to become an independent investigator in the medical field and potentially a leader in the field of medical imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 7.2 million people per year die world-wide from coronary artery disease (CAD), and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become a critical tool for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment of CAD. During medical imaging such as MPI, patient motion is virtually unavoidable and presents a significant source of image degradation and it has been suggested that upwards of 40% of cardiac studies in PET are effected by some type of motion with similar findings for SPECT. The proposed project will directly address the shortcomings of previous methods for tracking patient motion by developing and testing a novel low-cost marker-less visual tracking system for patient motion within hybrid imaging.",Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging,9300962,K25EB019032,"['Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Body Surface', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clothing', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Optics', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Security', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'heart motion', 'imaging study', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'perfusion imaging', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'virtual', 'visual tracking', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K25,2017,169609,0.03863896342913797
"Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  Modern radiation therapy treatment planning relies on volumetric (CT, or sometimes MRI) imaging to determine tumor location and spread. In addition, radiation oncologists treating head and neck cancer have long used a specific endoscopy - nasopharyngoscopy - to augment the treatment planning volumetric scan. In endoscopy, a thin, flexible light-pipe with a camera is inserted into the patient to obtain optical videos. Endoscopy is done because it is clear to the experienced clinician that direct visualization of a tumor and the surrounding anatomy can reveal valuable information not seen on CT or MRI scans. However, there is currently no way for the clinician to delineate the tumor volume on the endoscopic video and have that information placed correctly into the CT dataset used for treatment planning. Also, there is currently no way to view a combined CT/video dataset. Such a registration has not yet been accomplished in part because of the formidable problems of accurately registering a video taken during nasopharyngoscopy with a planning CT scan. In this proposal we will create a new method to register CT scans with endoscopic videos to produce a fused representation that can then displayed to the clinician to improve radiation treatment planning. To accomplish this, we will further develop and integrate methods of deformable registration, mechanical modeling, motion estimation, computer vision, and 3D interactive display. With such software, radiation treatment planning will have an entirely new and complementary source of information with which to determine tumor extent. Although outside the direct scope of this project, we believe that this technology can be extended to other parts of human anatomy and can be useful for surgical planning as well as radiation treatment planning. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop advanced image processing and display technologies and integrate them in such a way as to allow a clinician to simultaneously view fused internal photographs of the patient's throat and voice box along with the corresponding CT scans. Such a system will result in better tumor targeting for cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment of that part of the body. More accurate treatment will likely result in a highe cure rate for these cancers.",Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning,9246984,R01CA158925,"['Anatomy', 'Body part', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Endoscopy', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Larynx', 'Light', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motion', 'Nasopharyngoscopy', 'Nose', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Physical Examination', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Probability', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation induced damage', 'Radiation therapy', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Thinness', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'data structure', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'public health relevance', 'radiation risk', 'radiological imaging', 'software development', 'statistics', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,60564,0.04719227496238995
"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart transplant (Tx) surgery is a well-established life-saving procedure, but is associated with post- interventional risks such as acute cardiac rejection (ACR) which is one of the leading causes of death in the first year after transplant. Beyond the first year, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the single greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality. Monitoring the patient for post-transplant events is thus paramount. The standard monitoring strategy, however, relies on frequent (12-16 monitoring nodes during year 1 alone) invasive and costly procedures including endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) and catheter angiography. Since EMB and catheter angiography have limited sensitivity due to sampling errors (ACR) or the diffuse nature of the disease (CAV), a reliable non-invasive alternative for the early detection of ACR and CAV would be desirable to reduce the need for invasive procedures, improve sensitivity, and reduce cost. We have recently developed and applied cardiac MRI techniques for the non-invasive assessment of myocardial edema (T2-mapping), diffuse fibrosis (pre- and post-contrast T1-mapping), myocardial velocities (tissue phase mapping), and microvascular quantitative perfusion. We have shown that these techniques can identify distinct regional structural and functional alterations in the heart that correlate with te status of the allograft. Based on these findings, a detailed cost-effective analysis using Markov modeling and decision tree analysis has demonstrated that cardiac MR has tremendous potential to reduce monitoring costs by 40-50% during the first year after Tx alone. This proposal builds on these promising findings and our aim is to develop an new 15-minute structure-function cardiac MRI protocol for the improved detection regional abnormalities associated with ACR (edema, fibrosis, dysfunction) and CAV (perfusion, dysfunction). Integration of MRI with echocardiography and intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) will provide unique multi-modality assessment of the allograft. The application in a longitudinal clinical study coupled with state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis will allow redefining the most effective post-Tx mixed monitoring strategy. The aim is to to help clinicians identify the optimal mixed monitoring strategy, i.e. the optimal combination of multi-modality imaging (structure-function MRI, echo, IVUS) and invasive procedures (EMB, catheter angiography) which provide best outcome (quality adjusted life days) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop a multi-modality imaging protocol for the non-invasive characterization of tissue and function of the left and right heart in patients after heart transplantation. Our aim is to develop a new non- invasive 15 minute diagnostic test in order to provide a previously unattainable quantitative characterization of myocardial structure-function deficits in cardiac transplant patients. The application in a longitudinal clinial study coupled with cost-effectiveness analysis and decision tree modeling will allow to improve current monitoring strategies by combining cardiac MRI, echocardiography, intravascular ultrasound and invasive tests (biopsy, catheter angiography) to provide the best outcome (quality of life days, mortality) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient.",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,9229057,R01HL117888,"['Acute', 'Allografting', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost utility', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrosis', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Myocardial', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling Errors', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'base', 'comparative cost effectiveness', 'cost', 'extracellular', 'follow-up', 'heart allograft', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'post intervention', 'public health relevance', 'standard of care', 'two-arm study']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,680651,0.04028235476022135
"Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Abstract: Fast, reliable and accurate delineation of pelvic organs in the planning and treatment images is a long- standing, important and technically challenging problem. Its solution is highly required for state-of-the-art image-guided radiation therapy planning and treatment, as better treatment decisions rely on timely interpretation of anatomical information in the images. However, automatic segmentation in male pelvic regions is always difficult due to 1) low contrast between prostate and surrounding organs, and 2) possibly disparate shapes/appearances of bladder and rectum caused by tissue deformations. The goal of this project is to create a set of novel machine learning tools to achieve accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (e.g., prostate, bladder, and rectum) in different modalities (e.g., planning CT, treatment CT/CBCT, and MRI) for radiotherapy of prostate cancer.  Planning CT. For automatic segmentation, landmark detection is often the first step in rapidly locating the target organs. Thus, in Aim 1, we will create a novel joint landmark detection approach, based on both random forests and auto-context model, to iteratively detect all landmarks and further coordinate their detection results for achieving more accurate and consistent landmark detection results. After roughly locating organs with the aid of those detected landmarks, the second step is to accurately segment boundaries of target organs in the planning CT. Accordingly, in Aim 2, we will create a set of learning methods to a) first simultaneously predict all pelvic organ boundaries in the planning CT with the regression forests trained by labeled training data, and b) then segment all pelvic organs jointly by deforming their respective shape models. In particular, to address the limitations of conventional deformable models in assuming simple Gaussian distributions for organ shapes, a novel hierarchical sparse shape composition approach will be developed to constrain shape models during deformable segmentation.  Treatment CT/CBCT. During the course of serial radiation treatments, to quantitatively record and monitor the accumulated dose delivered to the patient, organs in the treatment image also need to be segmented. Although methods proposed in Aims 1-2 can be simply applied, as done by many conventional methods, this will lead to a) inconsistent landmark detection and b) inconsistent segmentations across different treatment days because of possible large shape/appearance changes. Accordingly, in Aim 3, we will create a novel self- learning mechanism to gradually learn and incorporate patient-specific information into both joint landmark detection and deformable segmentation steps from the increasingly acquired treatment images of patient. Thus, population data will gradually be replaced by the patient's own data to train personalized models.  MRI. To guide pelvic organ segmentation in the planning CT, MRI is now often acquired for selected patients. To this end, in Aim 4, we will develop a) a prostate MRI segmentation method by using deep learning to learn MRI-specific features for guiding landmark detection and deformable segmentation as proposed in Aims 1-2; b) a novel collaborative MRI and CT segmentation algorithm for more accurate segmentation of planning CT.  All our developed algorithms will be evaluated for their performance in clinical (treatment planning and delivery) workflow for 130 patients in UNC Cancer Hospital and also hospitals of our consultants.  Benefit for Patient Care. Development of these segmentation tools will 1) dramatically accelerate the clinical workflow, 2) reduce workload (i.e., manual interaction time) for physicians, and 3) lead to better patient outcomes with reliable and accurate segmentations of target area and critical organs. Although these tools cannot replace the expertise of physicians, they can be of great assistance to physicians.  Narrative Description of Project This project aims to create a set of novel machine learning tools for accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (such as prostate, bladder, and rectum) in various imaging modalities to help radiotherapy of prostate cancer. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel joint landmark detection and boundary prediction framework for accurate segmentation of the planning CT images, 2) an innovative updating mechanism for incorporating patient-specific information from previous treatment images of same patient to progressively improve treatment CT/CBCT segmentation, and 3) a deep-learning based framework for learning MRI-specific features for prostate MRI segmentation, as well as a novel method for collaborative MRI & planning CT segmentation. We will validate these methods on real patients in our clinical workflow. Besides, although these machine-learning tools are designed for radiotherapy of prostate cancer, they can also be easily extended to other new organs and new modalities after appropriate updating and training.",Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment,9186673,R01CA206100,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Hospital', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rectum', 'Sample Size', 'Shapes', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Update', 'Workload', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'design', 'dosage', 'forest', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'novel', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment duration', 'treatment planning']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2016,347254,0.0459081079975369
"Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. The goal of this proposal is to develop and provide a new analysis technique for understanding the complex cardiac motion patterns (in time and space) of patients with cardiac dyssynchrony, with the hope of improving its treatment outcomes, specifically with respect to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). CRT, the most effective treatment for dyssynchrony with worsening heart failure, significantly improves outcome in only ~66% of heart failure patients selected for the treatment, which is based on ECG criteria. Selection criteria based on imaging are essential to improving the success rate. Unfortunately, response rates are not higher with selection criteria based on echocardiography, the most popular cardiac imaging technique. Cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has the potential to better characterize dyssynchrony, as it shows cardiac mechanics and intramural wall motion with much higher spatial resolution than echocardiography. However, quantitative assessments of CMR have been mostly limited to global volumetric measures, which ignore most of the motion information captured by the images. For example, studies of a number of distinctive motion features of dyssynchrony (such as septal flash and apical rocking) have been confined to qualitative assessment, limiting inference of their potential utility for improving CRT treatment. To accurately quantify cardiac function through CMR, we have developed biomechanical models for describing cardiac function and machine learning technology for identifying morphological and functional patterns atypical for healthy hearts. We propose to combine these two technologies to accurately quantify cardiac dyssynchrony within the Left Ventricle (LV). Specifically, our methods will extract a rich description of LV motion and strain from the CMRs of a set of retrospectively selected subjects with synchronous or dyssynchronous LV motion. We will then use machine learning methods to identify local and global motion patterns specific to dyssynchrony. Finally, we will correlate these patterns to already existing clinical scores to find potentially predictive markers with respect to CRT outcome. We hypothesize that these markers will have a higher correlation to CRT outcome than current clinical markers alone. Identifying these markers will have the potential to further stratify the disease with respect to the expected outcome of CRT, which then can be used to derive new selection criteria that lead to higher success rates. The project will also disseminate our novel, data-driven methodology for quantifying that motion. Other research groups can apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases impacting LV motion in general. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy, as the current clinical selection criteria are too broad. Our goal is to more accurately characterize the complex shape and motion patterns of cardiac dyssynchrony, through new machine learning technology applied to dynamic cardiovascular magnetic resonance images. We envision that our findings would further improve both our understanding of cardiac dyssynchrony in relation to heart failure and the ability to predict its response to resynchronization therapy, potentially leading to new clinical guidelines and improved clinical outcomes.",Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony,9043186,R01HL127661,"['Apical', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Selection Criteria', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiac resynchronization therapy', 'cardiovascular visualization', 'effective therapy', 'heart motion', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'tool']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2016,599020,0.04079959377985678
"Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The quest for fast image acquisition speed has always been a perennial topic in the MRI community. To reduce the acquisition time for maximal spatial and temporal resolution, modern MRI protocols usually perform reduced acquisitions below the Nyquist rate. The reduced data is then used to reconstruct the image through advanced reconstruction techniques that leverage some prior information about the MRI system (e.g., parallel imaging) and/or MR signal (e.g., compressed sensing). Since such prior information is patient and system specific, recent techniques obtain the prior information using training data obtained through an empirical calibration procedure. All existing methods assume the prior models are linear. Since the intrinsic nonlinear relationship in the training data cannot be characterized in such simple models, the reconstruction is degraded by the inaccuracy of the prior information. Nonlinear learning from the training data have proven to be more powerful in machine learning because it is more general and includes the linear model as a special case. However, it is usually more challenging to learn the nonlinear models and even more challenging to incorporate the model in reconstruction due to the increased degree of freedom. We recently have introduced a novel concept of ""kernel"" in MR reconstruction to address the above challenges timely. Our preliminary results on parallel imaging and sparsity-constrained reconstruction demonstrate that the kernel-based algorithms improve the reconstruction quality over the original algorithms with linear prior models. Built upon our strong preliminary results, the objective of this application is to develop an innovative kernel-based framework for MR image reconstruction from undersampled data. This framework does not require explicit knowledge of nonlinear mapping (as in preliminary work) such that a broader family of nonlinear functions can be explored for different clinical applications. The proposed work is expected to advance the field of MR image reconstruction vertically. Specifically, the successful completion of the proposed project will result in a general framework leading to many new algorithms (including two developed in this project) for reconstruction from reduced acquisition. Therefore, virtually all of current clinical MRI could benefit from the improved resolution, image quality, and/or reduced acquisition times that the new framework will facilitate or the novel applications i may enable. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is to develop a general framework and two specific new techniques to improve the spatial resolution and/or reduce the scan time in magnetic resonance imaging and evaluate the performance of the techniques for 3D parallel imaging and quantitative imaging in brain. The development of such novel fast imaging techniques may greatly enhance diagnosis of neurological disease. Therefore the project will potentially benefit numerous subjects and the healthcare system.",Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling,9119020,R21EB020861,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Family', 'Freedom', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-linear Models', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Polynomial Models', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R21,2016,222652,0.027557965297289707
"High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before a heart attack, and predict risk in millions of patients annually. This is currently limited by the need fo visual interpretation, which is highly variable and depends on the physician's experience. The long-term objective of this program is to improve the interpretation of this widely used heart imaging technique-achieving higher accuracy for disease detection than it is possible by the best attainable visual analysis. This proposal builds on our prior work in conventional myocardial MPS, and focuses on fast, low-radiation MPS imaging (fast-MPS) obtained by new high-efficiency scanners. Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS. The algorithms will include better heart muscle detection by training with correlated anatomical data and a novel approach for mapping the probability of abnormal perfusion for each location of the heart muscle; 2) enhance the diagnosis of heart disease from fast-MPS by machine- learning algorithms that integrate clinical data, stress test parameters, and quantitative image features; 3) demonstrate the clinical utility of the new algorithms applied to automatic canceling of the rest portion of the MPS scan, when not needed. The new system will be more accurate than the clinical expert analysis in the detection of obstructive coronary disease. By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,9064178,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Stress', 'Stress Tests', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,695446,0.0169023401268334
"Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calcium scoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in the asymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surrounding the heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due to the absence of robust, automated quantification methods.  We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robust quantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a new integrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in two existing, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, late revascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) and the St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To develop and evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of new computational algorithms for automated quantification of EAT measures; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified EAT features, relative to atherosclerotic plaque burden and measures of obesity, for the prediction of future cardiac events in asymptomatic patients in the EISNER registry and the St. Francis Heart Study; 3) To derive and evaluate a new, integrated risk score—combining standard risk factors, coronary calcium score and EAT measures using machine learning—for the prediction of future cardiac events in the EISNER registry, and further, to additionally evaluate this risk score externally in the St. Francis Heart Study patient cohort.  This work in this proposal will provide a novel, personalized paradigm that will objectively and accurately identify asymptomatic patients undergoing coronary calcium scanning who are at increased risk for future cardiac events, without any additional imaging or risk to the patient. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) CT scanning of the heart for coronary calcium scoring is a simple, widely-used, low-cost test with low radiation dose. Using these scans, the researchers propose to establish automated analysis of fat which surrounds the heart, as well as novel computerized scores that identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack. This new research will allow doctors to better identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to avoid a heart attack or sudden cardiac death.",Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events,9159185,R01HL133616,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational algorithm', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early identification', 'Event', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Institution', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Interleukin-6', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reader', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Stenosis', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Visceral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'pericardial sac', 'predictive marker', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'sudden cardiac death']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,671851,0.023825428910864244
"Quantitative PET/CT Analysis to Improve Evaluation of Tumor Response DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to develop and validate a quantitative Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) image analysis framework to improve the evaluation of esophageal tumor response to chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. In Aim 1, we will extract comprehensive spatial and temporal features of a tumor from PET/CT images and evaluate their ability in predicting tumor response to CRT. These features will quantify the spatial characteristics of a tumor along with their changes due to CRT, adding a great amount of information to the current non-volumetric PET/CT response measures. Also, we will use image registration techniques to align pre-CRT images with post-CRT images, making it possible to quantify the spatial changes at the original tumor site. In Aim 2, we will construct and test reliable predictive models of tumo response to CRT using machine learning techniques with spatial- temporal PET/CT features, clinical parameters and demographics as input. The models will identify an optimal subset of predictive features and utilize PET and CT information in chorus. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel multi-modality adaptive region-growing algorithm for tumor delineation in PET/CT. We will compare the accuracy and precision of the resulting predictive models against those in which tumor is delineated using conventional methods (manual contouring or thresholding). This comparison will help us understand to what degree the prediction of tumor response depends on the tumor delineation methods. Finally, we will use pathologic response and survival as the end points and ground truth to cross-validate each predictive model. If all aims are achieved, the proposed PET/CT image analysis framework may provide a highly accurate diagnostic tool. This, will complement other diagnostic tests in assisting physicians in making a treatment decision to more appropriately select patients for surgery, thus avoiding the mortality and morbidity of surgery in responders for whom surgery can be safely deferred; while improving local control and survival in non- responders for whom surgery should be considered. Therefore, this work has the potential to improve outcomes by safely deferring surgery which will improve our locally advanced esophageal cancer patient's quality of life while simultaneously reducing costs.

"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning.

"Simultaneous imaging of myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism using dynamic 18F-FDG PET ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ischemic cardiomyopathy affects approximately 3 million people in the United States. This form of heart failure is the result of myocardial infarcton or severe coronary heart disease that reduces the viability and function of the heart. Ischemic cardiomyopathy is associated with poor long-term survival when patients with viable myocardium are not revascularized. By imaging myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism and seeking flow-metabolism mismatches, positron emission tomography (PET) method has been established as the gold standard of assessing myocardial viability for selecting patients who can benefit most from surgical revascularization. Current PET method employs two separate static scans with two different radiotracers for generation of the flow-metabolism image pair. While the image of glucose metabolism is acquired using the most widely used radiotracer 18F- fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), myocardial blood flow imaging with the radiotracer 13N-ammonia or rubidium-82 suffers from limited clinical availability. In addition, the imaging protoco of two separate imaging sessions is time consuming and resource intensive. As a result, myocardial viability via PET is currently under-utilized in clinic despite its high accuracy and th fast-growing installation of PET/CT scanners in the past decade. In this project, we propose to develop a novel PET method for myocardial viability assessment that only uses a single injection of FDG without the need of a flow- specific radiotracer. We hypothesize that myocardial blood flow can be derived from the quantitative kinetic parameters of dynamic FDG PET. We will develop a new multi-variable prediction model using statistical machine learning to predict myocardial blood flow from dynamic FDG PET data. We will also develop a shortened dynamic FDG PET protocol to improve practicality. This innovation will provide the flow-metabolism image pair for myocardial viability assessment in a clinically favorable time, cost and with reduced radiation dose. Success of this research will make PET assessment of myocardial viability more widely available in clinic with easier access, lower radiation dose, cheaper imaging cost and shorter clinical visit time as compared with conventional two-session protocols, thus improving our clinical practice of treating ischemic cardiomyopathy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a gold standard method for detecting viable myocardium to select which patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy to benefit most from surgical revascularization. Its use in clinic, however, is under-utilized because of the limited clinical availability of the radiotracers needed. This research aims to develop a novel PET imaging method for assessment of myocardial viability that can be easily accessed in clinic with reduced lower radiation dose and imaging cost without compromising imaging performance.              ",Simultaneous imaging of myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism using dynamic 18F-FDG PET,9020059,R21HL131385,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Ammonia', 'Blood', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Cyclotrons', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dose', 'Echocardiography', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Investments', 'Kinetics', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rubidium', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'United States', 'Visit', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'glucose metabolism', 'glucose transport', 'heart function', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'ischemic cardiomyopathy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'radiotracer', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'success', 'uptake']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2016,234875,0.07447127316280094
"Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma Glioblastoma is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Despite advances in neurosurgical resection, radiation targeting, and chemotherapy, the prognosis remains grim with a median survival of just 15 months. The effectiveness of current radiation therapy strategies is severely limited by shortcomings in the imaging modalities used to develop treatment plans. Current radiation therapy planning is mainly based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, which identifies high grade tumors that are immediately associated with leaky neovasculature. Although it is an excellent diagnostic tool to identify high grade from low grade tumors, it is unable to signal occult infiltration beyond the core of the tumor. Though many believe GBM to be an incurable disease, we believe we have identified a method for optimizing tumor targeting that will increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy. A significant component of the current problem in GBM therapy is the lack of treatment for non-enhancing regions that are significantly infiltrated by neoplastic glioma cells without neovascularization. This untreated population undoubtedly leads to early recurrence. The proposed study addresses an important step toward translating an advanced quantitative imaging modality that complements the conventional imaging that is capable of reliably revealing glioma- infiltrated regions for precise, personalized treatment targeting. Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an alternative modality able to identify endogenous metabolism within tissue without the need for exogenous contrast, and has been shown to identify the metabolic abnormalities associated with tumor beyond the regions identified by T1-weighted MRI. The clinical integration of sMRI in patient management has been limited due to the computational challenges of analysis of sMRI data. Two key hurdles to be overcome are the insufficiency of filters to remove image artifacts and the necessity of quantification of metabolic levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism. As a result, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and many hours of computational and user time. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in radiation therapy planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning, an approach to computation that has shattered benchmarks in many medical and non-medical problems. Specifically, we will develop filters for removing artifacts, algorithms for personalized diagnosis of tumor infiltration, and explore deep learning as a method to synthesize sMRI data with anatomical and clinical metrics in a fully automated fashion. Success in the proposed work will produce a “scanner-to-clinician” platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into the clinical radiation therapy planning paradigm. Ultimately, we believe this additional modality in the physician's tool belt will lead to better outcomes in patients suffering from this debilitating disease. Project Narrative  Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is a molecular imaging modality that can accurately detect abnormalities in the metabolic signatures of tumor cells, making it ideal for the detection and monitoring of highly infiltrative brain tumors like glioblastoma. Clinical adoption of sMRI has been slow due to limited tools for expedient and objective processing of sMRI data into information that oncologists can use for therapy planning. This proposal addresses these challenges using recent advances in high performance computing and machine learning to develop a software framework for using sMRI in the clinical management of patients with glioblastoma.",Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma,9191930,F30CA206291,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Excision', 'Gaussian model', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histology', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Infiltration', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Neoplasms', 'Oncologist', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Process', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Framework', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical application', 'contrast enhanced', 'dosage', 'expectation', 'histological image', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning network', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'neoplastic', 'neoplastic cell', 'neovascularization', 'neovasculature', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'software development', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'syntax', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'white matter']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F30,2016,43576,-0.0045409878279028355
"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more. This will be accomplished by: optimizing the image processing that is used, further developing new and better image processing methods, and developing a method of ""personalized imaging"", in which, for each individual patient, the minimum amount of imaging agent needed to obtain a good image is computed.",Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging,9061011,R01HL122484,"['4D Imaging', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Protection', 'Radioactive', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical practice', 'computer program', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'predictive modeling', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2016,770494,0.04689401739310822
"Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During medical imaging, patient motion is virtually unavoidable presenting a significant source of image degradation and artifacts, which in turn, can impact the quality of care received by many patients. One method used to address patient motion is to employ visual tracking systems (VTS), which involves placing a small number of reflective markers on the patient that can be located and tracked in 3D space using stereo cameras. The tracked markers can then be used as a surrogate to a structure of interest, such as the heart. The tracked surrogate provides a quantifiable measure that can be directly correlated with the motion of the target structure, which can then be used for prospective or retrospective motion correction. However, the markers add complexity to patient workflow, provide only a sparse sampling of the patient's surface, and the optimal number and placement of markers is unknown. This project addresses the shortcomings of marker-based VTS systems by proposing to develop and test a novel low-cost marker-less VTS system for tracking patient motion within a hybrid imaging system. The primary barrier for successfully tracking the patient's body surface using marker-less VTS is that clothing prevents an unobstructed view of the patient's body. The candidate, Dr. Lindsay, is proposing to incorporate a translational method using computational approaches to compensate for garments within the proposed marker-less VTS system. Dr. Lindsay has received training in computer science and computer vision and previously has focused on the computational aspects of capturing, modeling, and rendering of physical phenomena such as light and is proposing to extend this knowledge to the medical imaging field. Dr. Lindsay's goals for this proposal are to acquire the necessary training and skills that will allow him to translate his expertise and existing computational skills to an area f research with medical relevance: namely, detecting and tracking patient motion for the purpose of improving motion correction for hybrid- imaging. Dr. Lindsay's long-term career goal is to become an accomplished independent investigator focusing on solving significant problems in medical imaging by translating advances in Computer Science. The proposed work will take place the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (UMass) in Worcester, MA under the primary mentorship of Dr. Michael King, an internationally known expert in the area of medical imaging and medical physics in Nuclear Medicine. Drs. Gennert, Sullivan, Licho have expertise in computer vision, mechanical engineering and medical imaging, and radiology and Nuclear Medicine, respectively will also serve as co-mentors.  The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) develop a novel marker-less VTS, which we call PT- Cam, using low-cost using state-of-the-art camera technology, 2) model surface motion as a surrogate for internal motion of the heart, and 3) conduct tests of the PT-Cam system, in order to determine the acceptability and feasibility of clinical usage, on patients undergoing clinical MPI PET/CT imaging. Thus, the main objective of this program of research is to develop a clinically viable method for motion tracking patients undergoing hybrid-imaging studies by using a novel marker-less surface-tracking method that can compensate for clothing and provide modeling of interior motion of structures from surface tracking. If successful, not only will this project provide an innovative, marker-less VTS system for low-cost surface tracking for motion compensation during hybrid imaging but it will also give the candidate the necessary training needed to become an independent investigator in the medical field and potentially a leader in the field of medical imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 7.2 million people per year die world-wide from coronary artery disease (CAD), and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become a critical tool for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment of CAD. During medical imaging such as MPI, patient motion is virtually unavoidable and presents a significant source of image degradation and it has been suggested that upwards of 40% of cardiac studies in PET are effected by some type of motion with similar findings for SPECT. The proposed project will directly address the shortcomings of previous methods for tracking patient motion by developing and testing a novel low-cost marker-less visual tracking system for patient motion within hybrid imaging.",Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging,9132242,K25EB019032,"['Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Body Surface', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clothing', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marketing', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Optics', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Security', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'heart motion', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'skills', 'skills training', 'success', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'visual tracking', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K25,2016,169609,0.03863896342913797
"Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  Modern radiation therapy treatment planning relies on volumetric (CT, or sometimes MRI) imaging to determine tumor location and spread. In addition, radiation oncologists treating head and neck cancer have long used a specific endoscopy - nasopharyngoscopy - to augment the treatment planning volumetric scan. In endoscopy, a thin, flexible light-pipe with a camera is inserted into the patient to obtain optical videos. Endoscopy is done because it is clear to the experienced clinician that direct visualization of a tumor and the surrounding anatomy can reveal valuable information not seen on CT or MRI scans. However, there is currently no way for the clinician to delineate the tumor volume on the endoscopic video and have that information placed correctly into the CT dataset used for treatment planning. Also, there is currently no way to view a combined CT/video dataset. Such a registration has not yet been accomplished in part because of the formidable problems of accurately registering a video taken during nasopharyngoscopy with a planning CT scan. In this proposal we will create a new method to register CT scans with endoscopic videos to produce a fused representation that can then displayed to the clinician to improve radiation treatment planning. To accomplish this, we will further develop and integrate methods of deformable registration, mechanical modeling, motion estimation, computer vision, and 3D interactive display. With such software, radiation treatment planning will have an entirely new and complementary source of information with which to determine tumor extent. Although outside the direct scope of this project, we believe that this technology can be extended to other parts of human anatomy and can be useful for surgical planning as well as radiation treatment planning. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop advanced image processing and display technologies and integrate them in such a way as to allow a clinician to simultaneously view fused internal photographs of the patient's throat and voice box along with the corresponding CT scans. Such a system will result in better tumor targeting for cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment of that part of the body. More accurate treatment will likely result in a highe cure rate for these cancers.",Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning,9056996,R01CA158925,"['Anatomy', 'Body part', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Endoscopy', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Larynx', 'Light', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nasopharyngoscopy', 'Nose', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Physical Examination', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Probability', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'data structure', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'software development', 'statistics', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2016,306421,0.04719227496238995
"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart transplant (Tx) surgery is a well-established life-saving procedure, but is associated with post- interventional risks such as acute cardiac rejection (ACR) which is one of the leading causes of death in the first year after transplant. Beyond the first year, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the single greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality. Monitoring the patient for post-transplant events is thus paramount. The standard monitoring strategy, however, relies on frequent (12-16 monitoring nodes during year 1 alone) invasive and costly procedures including endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) and catheter angiography. Since EMB and catheter angiography have limited sensitivity due to sampling errors (ACR) or the diffuse nature of the disease (CAV), a reliable non-invasive alternative for the early detection of ACR and CAV would be desirable to reduce the need for invasive procedures, improve sensitivity, and reduce cost. We have recently developed and applied cardiac MRI techniques for the non-invasive assessment of myocardial edema (T2-mapping), diffuse fibrosis (pre- and post-contrast T1-mapping), myocardial velocities (tissue phase mapping), and microvascular quantitative perfusion. We have shown that these techniques can identify distinct regional structural and functional alterations in the heart that correlate with te status of the allograft. Based on these findings, a detailed cost-effective analysis using Markov modeling and decision tree analysis has demonstrated that cardiac MR has tremendous potential to reduce monitoring costs by 40-50% during the first year after Tx alone. This proposal builds on these promising findings and our aim is to develop an new 15-minute structure-function cardiac MRI protocol for the improved detection regional abnormalities associated with ACR (edema, fibrosis, dysfunction) and CAV (perfusion, dysfunction). Integration of MRI with echocardiography and intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) will provide unique multi-modality assessment of the allograft. The application in a longitudinal clinical study coupled with state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis will allow redefining the most effective post-Tx mixed monitoring strategy. The aim is to to help clinicians identify the optimal mixed monitoring strategy, i.e. the optimal combination of multi-modality imaging (structure-function MRI, echo, IVUS) and invasive procedures (EMB, catheter angiography) which provide best outcome (quality adjusted life days) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop a multi-modality imaging protocol for the non-invasive characterization of tissue and function of the left and right heart in patients after heart transplantation. Our aim is to develop a new non- invasive 15 minute diagnostic test in order to provide a previously unattainable quantitative characterization of myocardial structure-function deficits in cardiac transplant patients. The application in a longitudinal clinial study coupled with cost-effectiveness analysis and decision tree modeling will allow to improve current monitoring strategies by combining cardiac MRI, echocardiography, intravascular ultrasound and invasive tests (biopsy, catheter angiography) to provide the best outcome (quality of life days, mortality) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient.",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,9004651,R01HL117888,"['Acute', 'Allografting', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost utility', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling Errors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'base', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'extracellular', 'follow-up', 'heart allograft', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'standard of care', 'two-arm study']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2016,658634,0.04028235476022135
"Motion Compensated Brain PET Imaging for Neuroscience Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Advanced imaging technologies such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MR) have led to remarkable improvement in our knowledge of brain metabolism, function, and biochemistry. And yet, our understanding of most neurological disorders is at best rudimentary. Etiology of such common diseases as drug and alcohol addiction, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's dementia and Parkinson's remains elusive. Malignant brain tumors such as glioblastoma continue being fatal. Changes happening in the brain in such common syndromes as hospital-acquired delirium, and post-operative cognitive decline, are not understood. Most studies involving advanced brain imaging remain small due to logistical challenges, cost constraints, and difficulty of scanning neurological patients in standard radiology equipment. Acceleration of brain research is required to elucidate the pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric conditions. Brain Biosciences was established to make neurological imaging comfortable, inexpensive, and widely available both in the clinic and in the research laboratory. One of the common problems encountered in imaging research is unintentional patient motion. Head movement during Positron Emission Tomography (PET) degrades PET image quality, leads to image artifacts, and introduces quantitative errors. Motion is particularly common in confused patients with neurological diseases, drug addiction, and movement disorders. This problem becomes especially relevant as research involving lengthy dynamic scans, and high-resolution brain imaging becomes common. While sedation is often used to minimize the patient motion, sedative drugs change brain biochemistry, interfere with radiopharmaceutical uptake, and may cause side effects. Physical restraints are often distressing, and may increase patient agitation. In this direct Phase II SBIR proposal we seek to develop, clinically validate, and receive FDA clearance for FREEMotion(tm), a video-based head tracking system, enabling motion- compensated brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of neurological patients without sedation or physical head restraint. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application proposes to develop and validate a novel head tracking system capable of compensating for patient motion during high-resolution brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging. This device will lower improve the quality, comfort, and quantification of brain PET in patients with neurological and psychiatric diseases, as well as drug abuse.

"Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. The goal of this proposal is to develop and provide a new analysis technique for understanding the complex cardiac motion patterns (in time and space) of patients with cardiac dyssynchrony, with the hope of improving its treatment outcomes, specifically with respect to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). CRT, the most effective treatment for dyssynchrony with worsening heart failure, significantly improves outcome in only ~66% of heart failure patients selected for the treatment, which is based on ECG criteria. Selection criteria based on imaging are essential to improving the success rate. Unfortunately, response rates are not higher with selection criteria based on echocardiography, the most popular cardiac imaging technique. Cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has the potential to better characterize dyssynchrony, as it shows cardiac mechanics and intramural wall motion with much higher spatial resolution than echocardiography. However, quantitative assessments of CMR have been mostly limited to global volumetric measures, which ignore most of the motion information captured by the images. For example, studies of a number of distinctive motion features of dyssynchrony (such as septal flash and apical rocking) have been confined to qualitative assessment, limiting inference of their potential utility for improving CRT treatment. To accurately quantify cardiac function through CMR, we have developed biomechanical models for describing cardiac function and machine learning technology for identifying morphological and functional patterns atypical for healthy hearts. We propose to combine these two technologies to accurately quantify cardiac dyssynchrony within the Left Ventricle (LV). Specifically, our methods will extract a rich description of LV motion and strain from the CMRs of a set of retrospectively selected subjects with synchronous or dyssynchronous LV motion. We will then use machine learning methods to identify local and global motion patterns specific to dyssynchrony. Finally, we will correlate these patterns to already existing clinical scores to find potentially predictive markers with respect to CRT outcome. We hypothesize that these markers will have a higher correlation to CRT outcome than current clinical markers alone. Identifying these markers will have the potential to further stratify the disease with respect to the expected outcome of CRT, which then can be used to derive new selection criteria that lead to higher success rates. The project will also disseminate our novel, data-driven methodology for quantifying that motion. Other research groups can apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases impacting LV motion in general.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy, as the current clinical selection criteria are too broad. Our goal is to more accurately characterize the complex shape and motion patterns of cardiac dyssynchrony, through new machine learning technology applied to dynamic cardiovascular magnetic resonance images. We envision that our findings would further improve both our understanding of cardiac dyssynchrony in relation to heart failure and the ability to predict its response to resynchronization therapy, potentially leading to new clinical guidelines and improved clinical outcomes.            ",Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony,8875394,R01HL127661,"['Apical', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Selection Criteria', 'Shapes', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiovascular visualization', 'effective therapy', 'heart motion', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'tool']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2015,634258,0.04079959377985678
"Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The quest for fast image acquisition speed has always been a perennial topic in the MRI community. To reduce the acquisition time for maximal spatial and temporal resolution, modern MRI protocols usually perform reduced acquisitions below the Nyquist rate. The reduced data is then used to reconstruct the image through advanced reconstruction techniques that leverage some prior information about the MRI system (e.g., parallel imaging) and/or MR signal (e.g., compressed sensing). Since such prior information is patient and system specific, recent techniques obtain the prior information using training data obtained through an empirical calibration procedure. All existing methods assume the prior models are linear. Since the intrinsic nonlinear relationship in the training data cannot be characterized in such simple models, the reconstruction is degraded by the inaccuracy of the prior information. Nonlinear learning from the training data have proven to be more powerful in machine learning because it is more general and includes the linear model as a special case. However, it is usually more challenging to learn the nonlinear models and even more challenging to incorporate the model in reconstruction due to the increased degree of freedom. We recently have introduced a novel concept of ""kernel"" in MR reconstruction to address the above challenges timely. Our preliminary results on parallel imaging and sparsity-constrained reconstruction demonstrate that the kernel-based algorithms improve the reconstruction quality over the original algorithms with linear prior models. Built upon our strong preliminary results, the objective of this application is to develop an innovative kernel-based framework for MR image reconstruction from undersampled data. This framework does not require explicit knowledge of nonlinear mapping (as in preliminary work) such that a broader family of nonlinear functions can be explored for different clinical applications. The proposed work is expected to advance the field of MR image reconstruction vertically. Specifically, the successful completion of the proposed project will result in a general framework leading to many new algorithms (including two developed in this project) for reconstruction from reduced acquisition. Therefore, virtually all of current clinical MRI could benefit from the improved resolution, image quality, and/or reduced acquisition times that the new framework will facilitate or the novel applications i may enable.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is to develop a general framework and two specific new techniques to improve the spatial resolution and/or reduce the scan time in magnetic resonance imaging and evaluate the performance of the techniques for 3D parallel imaging and quantitative imaging in brain. The development of such novel fast imaging techniques may greatly enhance diagnosis of neurological disease. Therefore the project will potentially benefit numerous subjects and the healthcare system.            ",Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling,8953102,R21EB020861,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Family', 'Freedom', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-linear Models', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R21,2015,180330,0.027557965297289707
"High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before a heart attack, and predict risk in millions of patients annually. This is currently limited by the need fo visual interpretation, which is highly variable and depends on the physician's experience. The long-term objective of this program is to improve the interpretation of this widely used heart imaging technique-achieving higher accuracy for disease detection than it is possible by the best attainable visual analysis. This proposal builds on our prior work in conventional myocardial MPS, and focuses on fast, low-radiation MPS imaging (fast-MPS) obtained by new high-efficiency scanners. Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS. The algorithms will include better heart muscle detection by training with correlated anatomical data and a novel approach for mapping the probability of abnormal perfusion for each location of the heart muscle; 2) enhance the diagnosis of heart disease from fast-MPS by machine- learning algorithms that integrate clinical data, stress test parameters, and quantitative image features; 3) demonstrate the clinical utility of the new algorithms applied to automatic canceling of the rest portion of the MPS scan, when not needed. The new system will be more accurate than the clinical expert analysis in the detection of obstructive coronary disease. By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,8906912,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Stress', 'Stress Tests', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2015,685014,0.0169023401268334
"Quantitative PET/CT Analysis to Improve Evaluation of Tumor Response DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to develop and validate a quantitative Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) image analysis framework to improve the evaluation of esophageal tumor response to chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. In Aim 1, we will extract comprehensive spatial and temporal features of a tumor from PET/CT images and evaluate their ability in predicting tumor response to CRT. These features will quantify the spatial characteristics of a tumor along with their changes due to CRT, adding a great amount of information to the current non-volumetric PET/CT response measures. Also, we will use image registration techniques to align pre-CRT images with post-CRT images, making it possible to quantify the spatial changes at the original tumor site. In Aim 2, we will construct and test reliable predictive models of tumo response to CRT using machine learning techniques with spatial- temporal PET/CT features, clinical parameters and demographics as input. The models will identify an optimal subset of predictive features and utilize PET and CT information in chorus. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel multi-modality adaptive region-growing algorithm for tumor delineation in PET/CT. We will compare the accuracy and precision of the resulting predictive models against those in which tumor is delineated using conventional methods (manual contouring or thresholding). This comparison will help us understand to what degree the prediction of tumor response depends on the tumor delineation methods. Finally, we will use pathologic response and survival as the end points and ground truth to cross-validate each predictive model. If all aims are achieved, the proposed PET/CT image analysis framework may provide a highly accurate diagnostic tool. This, will complement other diagnostic tests in assisting physicians in making a treatment decision to more appropriately select patients for surgery, thus avoiding the mortality and morbidity of surgery in responders for whom surgery can be safely deferred; while improving local control and survival in non- responders for whom surgery should be considered. Therefore, this work has the potential to improve outcomes by safely deferring surgery which will improve our locally advanced esophageal cancer patient's quality of life while simultaneously reducing costs.

"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more. This will be accomplished by: optimizing the image processing that is used, further developing new and better image processing methods, and developing a method of ""personalized imaging"", in which, for each individual patient, the minimum amount of imaging agent needed to obtain a good image is computed.",Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging,8842707,R01HL122484,"['4D Imaging', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Protection', 'Radioactive', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical practice', 'computer program', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'predictive modeling', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2015,758935,0.04689401739310822
"Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During medical imaging, patient motion is virtually unavoidable presenting a significant source of image degradation and artifacts, which in turn, can impact the quality of care received by many patients. One method used to address patient motion is to employ visual tracking systems (VTS), which involves placing a small number of reflective markers on the patient that can be located and tracked in 3D space using stereo cameras. The tracked markers can then be used as a surrogate to a structure of interest, such as the heart. The tracked surrogate provides a quantifiable measure that can be directly correlated with the motion of the target structure, which can then be used for prospective or retrospective motion correction. However, the markers add complexity to patient workflow, provide only a sparse sampling of the patient's surface, and the optimal number and placement of markers is unknown. This project addresses the shortcomings of marker-based VTS systems by proposing to develop and test a novel low-cost marker-less VTS system for tracking patient motion within a hybrid imaging system. The primary barrier for successfully tracking the patient's body surface using marker-less VTS is that clothing prevents an unobstructed view of the patient's body. The candidate, Dr. Lindsay, is proposing to incorporate a translational method using computational approaches to compensate for garments within the proposed marker-less VTS system. Dr. Lindsay has received training in computer science and computer vision and previously has focused on the computational aspects of capturing, modeling, and rendering of physical phenomena such as light and is proposing to extend this knowledge to the medical imaging field. Dr. Lindsay's goals for this proposal are to acquire the necessary training and skills that will allow him to translate his expertise and existing computational skills to an area f research with medical relevance: namely, detecting and tracking patient motion for the purpose of improving motion correction for hybrid- imaging. Dr. Lindsay's long-term career goal is to become an accomplished independent investigator focusing on solving significant problems in medical imaging by translating advances in Computer Science. The proposed work will take place the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (UMass) in Worcester, MA under the primary mentorship of Dr. Michael King, an internationally known expert in the area of medical imaging and medical physics in Nuclear Medicine. Drs. Gennert, Sullivan, Licho have expertise in computer vision, mechanical engineering and medical imaging, and radiology and Nuclear Medicine, respectively will also serve as co-mentors.  The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) develop a novel marker-less VTS, which we call PT- Cam, using low-cost using state-of-the-art camera technology, 2) model surface motion as a surrogate for internal motion of the heart, and 3) conduct tests of the PT-Cam system, in order to determine the acceptability and feasibility of clinical usage, on patients undergoing clinical MPI PET/CT imaging. Thus, the main objective of this program of research is to develop a clinically viable method for motion tracking patients undergoing hybrid-imaging studies by using a novel marker-less surface-tracking method that can compensate for clothing and provide modeling of interior motion of structures from surface tracking. If successful, not only will this project provide an innovative, marker-less VTS system for low-cost surface tracking for motion compensation during hybrid imaging but it will also give the candidate the necessary training needed to become an independent investigator in the medical field and potentially a leader in the field of medical imaging.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 7.2 million people per year die world-wide from coronary artery disease (CAD), and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become a critical tool for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment of CAD. During medical imaging such as MPI, patient motion is virtually unavoidable and presents a significant source of image degradation and it has been suggested that upwards of 40% of cardiac studies in PET are effected by some type of motion with similar findings for SPECT. The proposed project will directly address the shortcomings of previous methods for tracking patient motion by developing and testing a novel low-cost marker-less visual tracking system for patient motion within hybrid imaging.                ",Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging,8968015,K25EB019032,"['Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Body Surface', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clothing', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marketing', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Optics', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Security', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'heart motion', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'skills', 'skills training', 'success', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'visual tracking', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K25,2015,169609,0.03863896342913797
"Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  Modern radiation therapy treatment planning relies on volumetric (CT, or sometimes MRI) imaging to determine tumor location and spread. In addition, radiation oncologists treating head and neck cancer have long used a specific endoscopy - nasopharyngoscopy - to augment the treatment planning volumetric scan. In endoscopy, a thin, flexible light-pipe with a camera is inserted into the patient to obtain optical videos. Endoscopy is done because it is clear to the experienced clinician that direct visualization of a tumor and the surrounding anatomy can reveal valuable information not seen on CT or MRI scans. However, there is currently no way for the clinician to delineate the tumor volume on the endoscopic video and have that information placed correctly into the CT dataset used for treatment planning. Also, there is currently no way to view a combined CT/video dataset. Such a registration has not yet been accomplished in part because of the formidable problems of accurately registering a video taken during nasopharyngoscopy with a planning CT scan. In this proposal we will create a new method to register CT scans with endoscopic videos to produce a fused representation that can then displayed to the clinician to improve radiation treatment planning. To accomplish this, we will further develop and integrate methods of deformable registration, mechanical modeling, motion estimation, computer vision, and 3D interactive display. With such software, radiation treatment planning will have an entirely new and complementary source of information with which to determine tumor extent. Although outside the direct scope of this project, we believe that this technology can be extended to other parts of human anatomy and can be useful for surgical planning as well as radiation treatment planning.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop advanced image processing and display technologies and integrate them in such a way as to allow a clinician to simultaneously view fused internal photographs of the patient's throat and voice box along with the corresponding CT scans. Such a system will result in better tumor targeting for cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment of that part of the body. More accurate treatment will likely result in a highe cure rate for these cancers.            ",Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning,8843721,R01CA158925,"['Anatomy', 'Body part', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Endoscopy', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Larynx', 'Light', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nasopharyngoscopy', 'Nose', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Physical Examination', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Probability', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Relative (related person)', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'data structure', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'public health relevance', 'software development', 'statistics', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2015,306421,0.04719227496238995
"Dynamic-CT-based biomarker for predicting clinical outcome in CRC DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States and is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. A patient's five-year survival rate depend on the tumor stage at the time of diagnosis, and stage of the tumor plays a substantial role in decision-making regarding treatment. Thus, precise pre-treatment diagnostic evaluation and staging of colorectal cancer are important. In addition, angiogenesis plays an important role in the process of growth and metastasis in CRC and is reported as a useful prognostic marker, similar to many other carcinomas. Thus, in vivo quantification of the tumor angiogenesis rate holds promise in improving the management of CRC. Perfusion computed tomography (PCT) acquires high temporal resolution images, thus enabling evaluation of hemodynamic changes of tissue in vivo by modeling tracer kinetics. PCT has been reported to characterize tumor angiogenesis, and to be a more sensitive imaging biomarker for predicting of overall survival (OS) of CRC patients than conventional tumor staging. In clinical practice, however, the PCT protocol is a trade-off between high-temporal resolution and the total radiation dose required. Thus, the use of dynamic CT imaging derived from four temporal phases, which include pre-contrast, arterial, portal, and delayed phases, is highly desirable, because it is more readily available and yields substantially lower radiation exposure to the patients than that of PCT. However, low temporal resolution in four-phase dynamic CT presents several barriers in modeling tracer kinetics, primarily because of the lack of temporal enhancement information, which limits the ability to obtain reliable physiological information. We will thus develop a novel continuous-time modeling of tracer kinetics without any discretization of the enhancement curves. Such an approach will enable estimation of the time lag between onset time points of input and response enhancements as well as other kinetic parameters in four-phase dynamic CT. We hypothesize that the proposed tracer kinetic model can be an effective imaging biomarker for the risk stratification of recurrence of CRC and for prediction of OS. To explore these hypotheses, the specific aims of the proposed project are (1) Develop a novel single-input continuous-time tracer kinetic model without any discretization to fit temporal enhancement curves in four-phase dynamic CT of the colon, and (2) develop kinetic-model-based imaging biomarkers from four-phase dynamic CT and evaluate their performance in predicting clinical outcome in CRC patients. Successful development of a novel imaging biomarker based on four-phase dynamic CT holds high promise for the development of tailor-made optimal therapy without excessive radiation exposure to the patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful development of a novel imaging biomarker based on four-phase dynamic CT holds high promise for the development of tailor-made optimal therapy without excessive radiation exposure to the patient. Using such a biomarker to optimize therapy will provide patients with more effective treatment, thus reducing side effects associated with unnecessary therapeutic regimens. In addition, use of this biomarker may result in cost savings in treatment by reducing frequency of follow-up examinations in patients with a low risk of recurrence.",Dynamic-CT-based biomarker for predicting clinical outcome in CRC,8893927,R21CA187877,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carcinoma', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Colon', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computational algorithm', 'Cost Savings', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Dose', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier Transform', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stratification', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'Tumor stage', 'United States', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abdominal aorta', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'colon cancer patients', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'response', 'temporal measurement']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2015,189225,0.0029958377826772276
"Prostate Cancer Assessment Via Integrated 3D ARFI Elasticity Imaging and Multi-Parametric MRI ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer (PCA) is the most common non-skin cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in American men, with over 186,000 new cases diagnosed and over 28,000 PCA deaths annually in the United States. Ultrasound-guided biopsy is the standard of care for confirming cancer, typically following elevated PSA levels; however, it has been estimated that up to 20% of men require three or more biopsy sessions for diagnosis, and biopsies have a high risk of hemorrhage and infection. Furthermore, biopsies are not sufficient for tumor delineation or characterization because they sparsely sample the entire organ. Regretfully, the deficiencies of biopsy have lead to over-treatment of indolent disease with radical prostatectomies, a drastic treatment that has significant risks of infection, hemorrhage, urinary incontinence, and impotence.  We are the inventors of Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) imaging and the inventors of Shear Wave Elasticity Imaging (SWEI) methods. We have now combined those methods into ARFI-SWEI imaging sequences that define a new and novel multi-parametric ultrasonic elasticity imaging system. This multi-parametric elasticity imaging approach provides an absolute, quantitative measure of tissue stiffness, at high resolution, in 3D, using ultrasound.  We hypothesize that synergistic diagnostic information from B-mode, ARFI-SWEI and multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI, e.g., diffusion weighted imaging and MR spectroscopy imaging) enable (a) the sensitive and specific diagnosis of PCA and (b) the accurate delineation of PCA margins. We propose retrospective studies on existing 3D B-mode, ARFI-SWEI and mpMRI imaging datasets to test this hypothesis. 1         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in American men, with over 186,000 new cases and over 28,000 deaths annually.

"Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers are heterogeneous in biology among patients, tumors in the same patient, and within tumors. As a result, they respond differently to therapy per patient, per tumor and within tumors. Different radiotracers and imaging modalities provide information about different aspects of biology and the physio-metabolic environments of the cancer. As a result, a single modality or radiotracer may not provide sufficient information to predict or assess response to therapy. We hypothesize that improved prediction and assessment of response can thus be obtained by combining quantitative image-derived parameters obtained from multiple imaging modalities or radiotracers. We propose to develop, optimize, and validate approaches for combining multiple image-derived parameters obtained from quantitative imaging procedures in order to optimally predict and assess treatment response. In particular, we propose to combine quantitative metrics from PET/CT, SPECT/CT, and MRI. We will first individually optimize the protocols, acquisition parameters, and imaging methods in order to get the most accurate and reliable parameters to combine. Optimally combining the parameters from different modalities requires knowledge of the reproducibility (precision) of the individual quantitative imaging parameters. We will thus use literature search, phantom studies, realistic simulations, and repeated patient studies to characterize the accuracy and precision of the individual quantitative imaging methods. We will then develop methods to combine the metrics to predict or assess treatment response per patient, per tumor and intra-tumor. We will apply and evaluate these methods in three clinical trials: dynamic and static FDG and FIT PET/CT to assess lung cancer response to cytotoxic chemotherapy; PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI in breast cancer response; and SPECT/CT, PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI to predict response of brain tumors to anti-angiogenic therapy. In these trials imaging parameters and their signatures will be linked to histology or survival outcomes to provide validation of the combined imaging parameter metrics. n/a",Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy,8895855,U01CA140204,"['Albumins', 'Anatomy', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors', 'Animal Model', 'Biology', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Breast Cancer therapy', 'Cellularity', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cytotoxic Chemotherapy', 'Data', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methionine', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'PET/CT scan', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Systemic disease', 'Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate', 'Therapeutic', 'Tracer', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Volume', 'Validation', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiotracer', 'response', 'simulation', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'text searching', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2015,658727,0.013468348011283007
"Quantitative Image Analysis Techniques for Optic Nerve Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disorders of the optic nerve (ON) account for a significant percentage of the 20 most impactful ophthalmological conditions. Collectively, diseases of the ON are the number one cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, and present serious public health concerns in the U.S. Consider, for example, that glaucoma impacts more than three million Americans and costs the U.S. economy almost $3 billion per year. Optic neuritis (i.e., inflammatory demyelination of the ON) is the initial symptom in ~25% of all multipl sclerosis (MS) cases (which impacts over 400 thousand Americans and introduces societal health care costs of nearly $30 billion per year). Nearly two thirds of MS patients will experience episodes of optic neuritis in their lifetimes, and 40-60% of patients have visual defects localized to the ON. These disorders irreversibly damage the ON. Even so, damage to axons in the ON is progressive, defined by a window of opportunity for treatment between loss of function and actual degeneration. The potential for recovery exists because there are treatments that can help prevent progression if administered during this window of opportunity. Yet, we do not have effective means to assess who is in the window and who will benefit from treatment. We propose to translate computational imaging methods from the neuroimaging community to provide robust, quantitative tools for assessing the optic nerve (ON) on clinical and research imaging sequences. These efforts will improve prognostic accuracy, lead to better understanding of patient responses, and enhance targeted interventions. The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse ON data from modern MRI and CT clinical sequences. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that qualitative ON phenotypes on longitudinal clinical imaging will differentiate individuals who respond to treatment versus those who do not.  The overall goal of this research is to provide a foundation for image analysis of the ON and its relationships with pathological disorders. We will build upon recent advances in robust medical image computing to segment the ON in clinical CT and MRI acquisitions, develop registration procedures to establish intra- and inter-subject correspondence, and bring together information from the multi-modal battery of imaging studies that are typically used in clinical care (aim 1). With these new methods, we will address the exploratory hypothesis that quantitative use of clinical imaging data can increase prognostic accuracy (aim 2). We note that aim 2 is particularly exploratory and in line with the high- risk/high-reward aspect of this mechanism; many studies have shown that baseline imaging does not conclusively predict long term outcome or treatment response. We hypothesize that this may be because early findings are related to edema and inflammation rather than cellular damage per se. Once this exploratory phase is complete, we will pursue promising prognostic biomarkers using more detailed condition staging criteria and including more than two longitudinal time points in the analysis. Ultimately, these efforts will improve assessment ON disease and, in turn, patient care.

"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart transplant (Tx) surgery is a well-established life-saving procedure, but is associated with post- interventional risks such as acute cardiac rejection (ACR) which is one of the leading causes of death in the first year after transplant. Beyond the first year, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the single greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality. Monitoring the patient for post-transplant events is thus paramount. The standard monitoring strategy, however, relies on frequent (12-16 monitoring nodes during year 1 alone) invasive and costly procedures including endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) and catheter angiography. Since EMB and catheter angiography have limited sensitivity due to sampling errors (ACR) or the diffuse nature of the disease (CAV), a reliable non-invasive alternative for the early detection of ACR and CAV would be desirable to reduce the need for invasive procedures, improve sensitivity, and reduce cost. We have recently developed and applied cardiac MRI techniques for the non-invasive assessment of myocardial edema (T2-mapping), diffuse fibrosis (pre- and post-contrast T1-mapping), myocardial velocities (tissue phase mapping), and microvascular quantitative perfusion. We have shown that these techniques can identify distinct regional structural and functional alterations in the heart that correlate with te status of the allograft. Based on these findings, a detailed cost-effective analysis using Markov modeling and decision tree analysis has demonstrated that cardiac MR has tremendous potential to reduce monitoring costs by 40-50% during the first year after Tx alone. This proposal builds on these promising findings and our aim is to develop an new 15-minute structure-function cardiac MRI protocol for the improved detection regional abnormalities associated with ACR (edema, fibrosis, dysfunction) and CAV (perfusion, dysfunction). Integration of MRI with echocardiography and intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) will provide unique multi-modality assessment of the allograft. The application in a longitudinal clinical study coupled with state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis will allow redefining the most effective post-Tx mixed monitoring strategy. The aim is to to help clinicians identify the optimal mixed monitoring strategy, i.e. the optimal combination of multi-modality imaging (structure-function MRI, echo, IVUS) and invasive procedures (EMB, catheter angiography) which provide best outcome (quality adjusted life days) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop a multi-modality imaging protocol for the non-invasive characterization of tissue and function of the left and right heart in patients after heart transplantation. Our aim is to develop a new non- invasive 15 minute diagnostic test in order to provide a previously unattainable quantitative characterization of myocardial structure-function deficits in cardiac transplant patients. The application in a longitudinal clinial study coupled with cost-effectiveness analysis and decision tree modeling will allow to improve current monitoring strategies by combining cardiac MRI, echocardiography, intravascular ultrasound and invasive tests (biopsy, catheter angiography) to provide the best outcome (quality of life days, mortality) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient.",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,8797337,R01HL117888,"['Acute', 'Allografting', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost utility', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling Errors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'base', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'extracellular', 'follow-up', 'heart allograft', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'two-arm study']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2015,596707,0.04028235476022135
"Noninvasive imaging-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to establish a strategy that will make neuronal electrical signaling detectable via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a whole-brain level. Our approach is built on the novel concept of using cell-adhesive micron-scale electronic devices to transduce neuronal potentials across the brain into magnetic field fluctuations. As part of our validation of these voltage-sensing microprobes, we also propose to implement a new, scalable method for simultaneous recording of MRI and electrophysiological data. The methods we propose to develop will be broadly applicable to problems in neurobiology, and will transform neuroscientists' ability to study integrative functions of the brain. Our microprobe approach will also help establish a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine and molecular imaging, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology. Recent work has dem- onstrated that micron-scale electrodes, coated with cell-adhesive molecules and juxtaposed against cultured cells allow recording of millivolt-scale action potentials, comparable to intracellular recordings. The current induced in a microelectrode can be converted into a modest, transient magnetic field if it is channeled into an inductor. In Specific Aim 1, we will model the magnetic fields produced by feasible currents in spiral or solenoidal microcoils of defined geometry, compute predicted effects on MRI signal amplitude and phase as a function of microprobe distribution, and fabricate the microprobes themselves. Preliminary calculations indicate that localized, transient fields of about 10 nT could be produced in individual 10-turn microcoils of 1 5m diameter. Magnetic fields of this order are greater than endogenous neuronal fields detected in tech- nologies like magnetoencephalography, and have been shown previously to be measurable by MRI in some contexts. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the ability of our microprobes to report action potentials from neu- ronal populations in MRI. The microdevices wil first be applied to cultured neurons or neural tissue slices and placed in an MRI scanner. Data series will be obtained using multiple protocols to detect variations of MRI signal due to variations in neuronal activity. If experiments in culture are successful, microprobes will be site-specifically injected into the cerebral cortex of anesthetized rats, and tested in an somatosensory stimu- lation paradigm. In Specific Aim 3, we will establish a simultaneous MRI and conventional electrophysiology approach to validate the novel MRI voltage probes directly. Performing electrophysiology in an MRI scanner is complicated by artifacts induced by the scanning hardware, in particular due to switched gradient fields. To circumvent this problem, we will measure neuronal potentials using differential recording from pairs of channels on tetrodes or modified tetrodes. Once the in-scanner recording method has been refined, MRI- based and conventional electrophysiology data will be obtained and compared to assess performance of the voltage-sensing microprobes, and to guide further improvements, if necessary. Noninvasive MRI-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices will have high impact in biology, and specifically in brain research, both through applications to the study of neurological disease and as tools for the analysis of neural network function in basic neuroscience.

"Motion Compensated Brain PET Imaging for Neuroscience Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Advanced imaging technologies such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MR) have led to remarkable improvement in our knowledge of brain metabolism, function, and biochemistry. And yet, our understanding of most neurological disorders is at best rudimentary. Etiology of such common diseases as drug and alcohol addiction, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's dementia and Parkinson's remains elusive. Malignant brain tumors such as glioblastoma continue being fatal. Changes happening in the brain in such common syndromes as hospital-acquired delirium, and post-operative cognitive decline, are not understood. Most studies involving advanced brain imaging remain small due to logistical challenges, cost constraints, and difficulty of scanning neurological patients in standard radiology equipment. Acceleration of brain research is required to elucidate the pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric conditions. Brain Biosciences was established to make neurological imaging comfortable, inexpensive, and widely available both in the clinic and in the research laboratory. One of the common problems encountered in imaging research is unintentional patient motion. Head movement during Positron Emission Tomography (PET) degrades PET image quality, leads to image artifacts, and introduces quantitative errors. Motion is particularly common in confused patients with neurological diseases, drug addiction, and movement disorders. This problem becomes especially relevant as research involving lengthy dynamic scans, and high-resolution brain imaging becomes common. While sedation is often used to minimize the patient motion, sedative drugs change brain biochemistry, interfere with radiopharmaceutical uptake, and may cause side effects. Physical restraints are often distressing, and may increase patient agitation. In this direct Phase II SBIR proposal we seek to develop, clinically validate, and receive FDA clearance for FREEMotion(tm), a video-based head tracking system, enabling motion- compensated brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of neurological patients without sedation or physical head restraint.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application proposes to develop and validate a novel head tracking system capable of compensating for patient motion during high-resolution brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging. This device will lower improve the quality, comfort, and quantification of brain PET in patients with neurological and psychiatric diseases, as well as drug abuse.

"High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before a heart attack, and predict risk in millions of patients annually. This is currently limited by the need fo visual interpretation, which is highly variable and depends on the physician's experience. The long-term objective of this program is to improve the interpretation of this widely used heart imaging technique-achieving higher accuracy for disease detection than it is possible by the best attainable visual analysis. This proposal builds on our prior work in conventional myocardial MPS, and focuses on fast, low-radiation MPS imaging (fast-MPS) obtained by new high-efficiency scanners. Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS. The algorithms will include better heart muscle detection by training with correlated anatomical data and a novel approach for mapping the probability of abnormal perfusion for each location of the heart muscle; 2) enhance the diagnosis of heart disease from fast-MPS by machine- learning algorithms that integrate clinical data, stress test parameters, and quantitative image features; 3) demonstrate the clinical utility of the new algorithms applied to automatic canceling of the rest portion of the MPS scan, when not needed. The new system will be more accurate than the clinical expert analysis in the detection of obstructive coronary disease. By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.            ",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,8762268,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Generations', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Stress', 'Stress Tests', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2014,653934,0.0169023401268334
"Quantitative PET/CT Analysis to Improve Evaluation of Tumor Response     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to develop and validate a quantitative Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) image analysis framework to improve the evaluation of esophageal tumor response to chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. In Aim 1, we will extract comprehensive spatial and temporal features of a tumor from PET/CT images and evaluate their ability in predicting tumor response to CRT. These features will quantify the spatial characteristics of a tumor along with their changes due to CRT, adding a great amount of information to the current non-volumetric PET/CT response measures. Also, we will use image registration techniques to align pre-CRT images with post-CRT images, making it possible to quantify the spatial changes at the original tumor site. In Aim 2, we will construct and test reliable predictive models of tumo response to CRT using machine learning techniques with spatial- temporal PET/CT features, clinical parameters and demographics as input. The models will identify an optimal subset of predictive features and utilize PET and CT information in chorus. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel multi-modality adaptive region-growing algorithm for tumor delineation in PET/CT. We will compare the accuracy and precision of the resulting predictive models against those in which tumor is delineated using conventional methods (manual contouring or thresholding). This comparison will help us understand to what degree the prediction of tumor response depends on the tumor delineation methods. Finally, we will use pathologic response and survival as the end points and ground truth to cross-validate each predictive model. If all aims are achieved, the proposed PET/CT image analysis framework may provide a highly accurate diagnostic tool. This, will complement other diagnostic tests in assisting physicians in making a treatment decision to more appropriately select patients for surgery, thus avoiding the mortality and morbidity of surgery in responders for whom surgery can be safely deferred; while improving local control and survival in non- responders for whom surgery should be considered. Therefore, this work has the potential to improve outcomes by safely deferring surgery which will improve our locally advanced esophageal cancer patient's quality of life while simultaneously reducing costs.

"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more. This will be accomplished by: optimizing the image processing that is used, further developing new and better image processing methods, and developing a method of ""personalized imaging"", in which, for each individual patient, the minimum amount of imaging agent needed to obtain a good image is computed.            ",Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging,8674683,R01HL122484,"['4D Imaging', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Protection', 'Radioactive', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer program', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2014,782871,0.04689401739310822
"Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  Modern radiation therapy treatment planning relies on volumetric (CT, or sometimes MRI) imaging to determine tumor location and spread. In addition, radiation oncologists treating head and neck cancer have long used a specific endoscopy - nasopharyngoscopy - to augment the treatment planning volumetric scan. In endoscopy, a thin, flexible light-pipe with a camera is inserted into the patient to obtain optical videos. Endoscopy is done because it is clear to the experienced clinician that direct visualization of a tumor and the surrounding anatomy can reveal valuable information not seen on CT or MRI scans. However, there is currently no way for the clinician to delineate the tumor volume on the endoscopic video and have that information placed correctly into the CT dataset used for treatment planning. Also, there is currently no way to view a combined CT/video dataset. Such a registration has not yet been accomplished in part because of the formidable problems of accurately registering a video taken during nasopharyngoscopy with a planning CT scan. In this proposal we will create a new method to register CT scans with endoscopic videos to produce a fused representation that can then displayed to the clinician to improve radiation treatment planning. To accomplish this, we will further develop and integrate methods of deformable registration, mechanical modeling, motion estimation, computer vision, and 3D interactive display. With such software, radiation treatment planning will have an entirely new and complementary source of information with which to determine tumor extent. Although outside the direct scope of this project, we believe that this technology can be extended to other parts of human anatomy and can be useful for surgical planning as well as radiation treatment planning.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop advanced image processing and display technologies and integrate them in such a way as to allow a clinician to simultaneously view fused internal photographs of the patient's throat and voice box along with the corresponding CT scans. Such a system will result in better tumor targeting for cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment of that part of the body. More accurate treatment will likely result in a highe cure rate for these cancers.            ",Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning,8633431,R01CA158925,"['Anatomy', 'Body part', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Endoscopy', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Larynx', 'Light', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nasopharyngoscopy', 'Nose', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Physical Examination', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Probability', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Relative (related person)', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'data structure', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'public health relevance', 'software development', 'statistics', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2014,297228,0.04719227496238995
"Dynamic-CT-based biomarker for predicting clinical outcome in CRC DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States and is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. A patient's five-year survival rate depend on the tumor stage at the time of diagnosis, and stage of the tumor plays a substantial role in decision-making regarding treatment. Thus, precise pre-treatment diagnostic evaluation and staging of colorectal cancer are important. In addition, angiogenesis plays an important role in the process of growth and metastasis in CRC and is reported as a useful prognostic marker, similar to many other carcinomas. Thus, in vivo quantification of the tumor angiogenesis rate holds promise in improving the management of CRC. Perfusion computed tomography (PCT) acquires high temporal resolution images, thus enabling evaluation of hemodynamic changes of tissue in vivo by modeling tracer kinetics. PCT has been reported to characterize tumor angiogenesis, and to be a more sensitive imaging biomarker for predicting of overall survival (OS) of CRC patients than conventional tumor staging. In clinical practice, however, the PCT protocol is a trade-off between high-temporal resolution and the total radiation dose required. Thus, the use of dynamic CT imaging derived from four temporal phases, which include pre-contrast, arterial, portal, and delayed phases, is highly desirable, because it is more readily available and yields substantially lower radiation exposure to the patients than that of PCT. However, low temporal resolution in four-phase dynamic CT presents several barriers in modeling tracer kinetics, primarily because of the lack of temporal enhancement information, which limits the ability to obtain reliable physiological information. We will thus develop a novel continuous-time modeling of tracer kinetics without any discretization of the enhancement curves. Such an approach will enable estimation of the time lag between onset time points of input and response enhancements as well as other kinetic parameters in four-phase dynamic CT. We hypothesize that the proposed tracer kinetic model can be an effective imaging biomarker for the risk stratification of recurrence of CRC and for prediction of OS. To explore these hypotheses, the specific aims of the proposed project are (1) Develop a novel single-input continuous-time tracer kinetic model without any discretization to fit  temporal enhancement curves in four-phase dynamic CT of the colon, and (2) develop kinetic-model-based imaging biomarkers from four-phase dynamic CT and evaluate their performance in predicting clinical outcome in CRC patients. Successful development of a novel imaging biomarker based on four-phase dynamic CT holds high promise for the development of tailor-made optimal therapy without excessive radiation exposure to the patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful development of a novel imaging biomarker based on four-phase dynamic CT holds high promise for the development of tailor-made optimal therapy without excessive radiation exposure to the patient. Using such a biomarker to optimize therapy will provide patients with more effective treatment, thus reducing side effects associated with unnecessary therapeutic regimens.

"Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers are heterogeneous in biology among patients, tumors in the same patient, and within tumors. As a result, they respond differently to therapy per patient, per tumor and within tumors. Different radiotracers and imaging modalities provide information about different aspects of biology and the physio-metabolic environments of the cancer. As a result, a single modality or radiotracer may not provide sufficient information to predict or assess response to therapy. We hypothesize that improved prediction and assessment of response can thus be obtained by combining quantitative image-derived parameters obtained from multiple imaging modalities or radiotracers. We propose to develop, optimize, and validate approaches for combining multiple image-derived parameters obtained from quantitative imaging procedures in order to optimally predict and assess treatment response. In particular, we propose to combine quantitative metrics from PET/CT, SPECT/CT, and MRI. We will first individually optimize the protocols, acquisition parameters, and imaging methods in order to get the most accurate and reliable parameters to combine. Optimally combining the parameters from different modalities requires knowledge of the reproducibility (precision) of the individual quantitative imaging parameters. We will thus use literature search, phantom studies, realistic simulations, and repeated patient studies to characterize the accuracy and precision of the individual quantitative imaging methods. We will then develop methods to combine the metrics to predict or assess treatment response per patient, per tumor and intra-tumor. We will apply and evaluate these methods in three clinical trials: dynamic and static FDG and FIT PET/CT to assess lung cancer response to cytotoxic chemotherapy; PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI in breast cancer response; and SPECT/CT, PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI to predict response of brain tumors to anti-angiogenic therapy. In these trials imaging parameters and their signatures will be linked to histology or survival outcomes to provide validation of the combined imaging parameter metrics.          n/a",Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy,8712174,U01CA140204,"['Albumins', 'Anatomy', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors', 'Animal Model', 'Biology', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cellularity', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cytotoxic Chemotherapy', 'Data', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methionine', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'PET/CT scan', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Systemic disease', 'Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate', 'Therapeutic', 'Tracer', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Volume', 'Validation', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'radiotracer', 'response', 'simulation', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'text searching', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2014,641994,0.013468348011283007
"Quantitative Image Analysis Techniques for Optic Nerve Disease  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Disorders of the optic nerve (ON) account for a significant percentage of the 20 most impactful ophthalmological conditions. Collectively, diseases of the ON are the number one cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, and present serious public health concerns in the U.S. Consider, for example, that glaucoma impacts more than three million Ameri- cans and costs the U.S. economy almost $3 billion per year. Optic neuritis (i.e., inflammatory demyelination of the ON) is the initial symptom in ~25% of all multiple sclerosis (MS) cases (which impacts over 400 thousand Americans and intro- duces societal health care costs of nearly $30 billion per year). Nearly two thirds of MS patients will experience episodes of optic neuritis in their lifetimes, and 40-60% of patients have visual defects localized to the ON. These disorders irre- versibly damage the ON. Even so, damage to axons in the ON is progressive, defined by a window of opportunity for treatment between loss of function and actual degeneration. The potential for recovery exists because there are treatments that can help prevent progression if administered during this window of opportunity. Yet, we do not have effective means to assess who is in the window and who will benefit from treatment.  We propose to translate computational imaging methods from the neuroimaging community to provide ro- bust, quantitative tools for assessing the optic nerve (ON) on clinical and research imaging sequences. These efforts will improve prognostic accuracy, lead to better understanding of patient responses, and enhance targeted interven- tions. The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse ON data from modern MRI and CT clinical sequences. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that qualitative ON phenotypes on longitudinal clinical imaging will differentiate individuals who respond to treatment versus those who do not.  The overall goal of this research is to provide a foundation for image analysis of the ON and its relationships with pathological disorders. We will build upon recent advances in robust medical image computing to segment the ON in clinical CT and MRI acquisitions, develop registration procedures to establish intra- and inter-subject correspondence, and bring together information from the multi-modal battery of imaging studies that are typically used in clinical care (aim 1). With these new methods, we will address the exploratory hypothesis that quantitative use of clinical imaging data can increase prognostic accuracy (aim 2). We note that aim 2 is particularly exploratory and in line with the high- risk/high-reward aspect of this mechanism; many studies have shown that baseline imaging does not conclusively pre- dict long term outcome or treatment response. We hypothesize that this may be because early findings are related to edema and inflammation rather than cellular damage per se. Once this exploratory phase is complete, we will pursue promising prognostic biomarkers using more detailed condition staging criteria and including more than two longitudinal time points in the analysis. Ultimately, these efforts will improve assessment ON disease and, in turn, patient care.

"Prostate-cancer Imaging by Combined Ultrasound and Magnetic-resonance Parameters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance to detect PCa; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project is highly significant because it addresses a major health problem in the United States and other developed countries. The project will overcome the current inability of established clinical-imaging method to image PCa reliably by combining the capabilities of advanced ultrasound (US) and magnetic-resonance (MR) techniques in a clinically effective manner. The proposed approach will exploit the sensitivity of US to mechanical properties of tissue on a microscopic scale with the sensitivity of MR to chemical constituents of tissue and its ability to sense blood distribution. Each of these modalities senses different and independent properties of tissue and has shown encouraging potential for improved imaging of PCa when used alone; combining parameters derived from each modality can provide far superior sensitivity and specificity for PCa. We will combine US and MR parameters using advanced classifiers such as artificial neural networks and support-vector machines. These classifiers already have produced ROC-curve areas of 0.91 for advanced US methods, and the MR methods have demonstrated equivalent ROC-curve areas in many studies. We will embody the combined capabilities in specifications for a prototype imaging system that can generate prostate tissue-typing images (TTIs) in real-time for targeting biopsies or planning treatment in the operating room or in an off-line setting. The latest Logiq E9 instrument currently being produced by GE already has a capability for fusing previously obtained MR images with US images in real time, which provides an existing framework for combining US and MR parameters and generating real-time TTIs. Successfully generating reliable prostate TTIs based on combined US and MR parameters will represent a quantum advance in PCa management by enabling significant improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of PCa.        Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project will combine attributes of advanced ultrasound and magnetic-resonance techniques and embody them in a prototype imaging system capable of generating novel tissue-type images that reliably depict PCa in real-time.

"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation  SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Heart transplant (Tx) surgery is a well-established life-saving procedure, but is associated with post- interventional risks such as acute cardiac rejection (ACR) which is one of the leading causes of death in the first year after transplant. Beyond the first year, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the single greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality. Monitoring the patient for post-transplant events is thus paramount. The standard monitoring strategy, however, relies on frequent (12-16 monitoring nodes during year 1 alone) invasive and costly procedures including endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) and catheter angiography. Since EMB and catheter angiography have limited sensitivity due to sampling errors (ACR) or the diffuse nature of the disease (CAV), a reliable non-invasive alternative for the early detection of ACR and CAV would be desirable to reduce the need for invasive procedures, improve sensitivity, and reduce cost. We have recently developed and applied cardiac MRI techniques for the non-invasive assessment of myocardial edema (T2-mapping), diffuse fibrosis (pre- and post-contrast T1-mapping), myocardial velocities (tissue phase mapping), and microvascular quantitative perfusion. We have shown that these techniques can identify distinct regional structural and functional alterations in the heart that correlate with the status of the allograft. Based on these findings, a detailed cost-effective analysis using Markov modeling and decision tree analysis has demonstrated that cardiac MR has tremendous potential to reduce monitoring costs by 40-50% during the first year after Tx alone. This proposal builds on these promising findings and our aim is to develop an new 15-minute structure-function cardiac MRI protocol for the improved detection regional abnormalities associated with ACR (edema, fibrosis, dysfunction) and CAV (perfusion, dysfunction). Integration of MRI with echocardiography and intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) will provide unique multi-modality assessment of the allograft. The application in a longitudinal clinical study coupled with state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis will allow redefining the most effective post-Tx mixed monitoring strategy. The aim is to to help clinicians identify the optimal mixed monitoring strategy, i.e. the optimal combination of multi-modality imaging (structure-function MRI, echo, IVUS) and invasive procedures (EMB, catheter angiography) which provide best outcome (quality adjusted life days) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop a multi-modality imaging protocol for the non-invasive characterization of tissue and function of the left and right heart in patients after heart transplantation. Our aim is to develop a new non- invasive 15 minute diagnostic test in order to provide a previously unattainable quantitative characterization of myocardial structure-function deficits in cardiac transplant patients. The application in a longitudinal clinial study coupled with cost-effectiveness analysis and decision tree modeling will allow to improve current monitoring strategies by combining cardiac MRI, echocardiography, intravascular ultrasound and invasive tests (biopsy, catheter angiography) to provide the best outcome (quality of life days, mortality) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient.            ",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,8630169,R01HL117888,"['Acute', 'Allografting', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling Errors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'base', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'extracellular', 'follow-up', 'heart allograft', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'two-arm study']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2014,467351,0.039523511018264616
"Noninvasive imaging-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to establish a strategy that will make neuronal electrical signaling detectable via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a whole-brain level. Our approach is built on the novel concept of using cell-adhesive micron-scale electronic devices to transduce neuronal potentials across the brain into magnetic field fluctuations. As part of our validation of these voltage-sensing microprobes, we also propose to implement a new, scalable method for simultaneous recording of MRI and electrophysiological data. The methods we propose to develop will be broadly applicable to problems in neurobiology, and will transform neuroscientists' ability to study integrative functions of the brain. Our microprobe approach will also help establish a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine and molecular imaging, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology. Recent work has dem- onstrated that micron-scale electrodes, coated with cell-adhesive molecules and juxtaposed against cultured cells allow recording of millivolt-scale action potentials, comparable to intracellular recordings. The current induced in a microelectrode can be converted into a modest, transient magnetic field if it is channeled into an inductor. In Specific Aim 1, we will model the magnetic fields produced by feasible currents in spiral or solenoidal microcoils of defined geometry, compute predicted effects on MRI signal amplitude and phase as a function of microprobe distribution, and fabricate the microprobes themselves. Preliminary calculations indicate that localized, transient fields of about 10 nT could be produced in individual 10-turn microcoils of 1 5m diameter. Magnetic fields of this order are greater than endogenous neuronal fields detected in tech- nologies like magnetoencephalography, and have been shown previously to be measurable by MRI in some contexts. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the ability of our microprobes to report action potentials from neu- ronal populations in MRI. The microdevices wil first be applied to cultured neurons or neural tissue slices and placed in an MRI scanner. Data series will be obtained using multiple protocols to detect variations of MRI signal due to variations in neuronal activity. If experiments in culture are successful, microprobes will be site-specifically injected into the cerebral cortex of anesthetized rats, and tested in an somatosensory stimu- lation paradigm. In Specific Aim 3, we will establish a simultaneous MRI and conventional electrophysiology approach to validate the novel MRI voltage probes directly. Performing electrophysiology in an MRI scanner is complicated by artifacts induced by the scanning hardware, in particular due to switched gradient fields. To circumvent this problem, we will measure neuronal potentials using differential recording from pairs of channels on tetrodes or modified tetrodes. Once the in-scanner recording method has been refined, MRI- based and conventional electrophysiology data will be obtained and compared to assess performance of the voltage-sensing microprobes, and to guide further improvements, if necessary.         Noninvasive MRI-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices will have high impact in biology, and specifically in brain research, both through applications to the study of neurological disease and as tools for the analysis of neural network function in basic neuroscience. The microprobes we propose to develop represent a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology.

"Decision support with MRI for targeting, evaluating laser ablation for prostate c     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For a growing population of low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer (CaP) patients, active surveillance may be biologically or psychologically undesirable. Yet the short- and long-term complications and co-morbidities associated with radical whole-organ therapies (e.g. intensity modulated radiation therapy) are still associated with a risk of treatment-related morbidity. With radical whole gland therapies, in certain patients who are more sensitive to radiation treatment, high dosage spots in the rectum and in the bladder can lead to complications including chronic rectal bleeding, diarrhea, and urinary symptoms such as cystitis. Laser induced interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a novel form of controlled, targeted thermal ablation that may offer measurable advantages over other ablative therapies for focal prostate therapy. Because LITT is MRI compatible, it enables an imaging advantage over other surgical or ablation techniques that utilize transrectal ultrasound to target and monitor treatment. However successful adoption of focal therapy for the treatment of CaP will hinge on several critical issues: 1) Can we accurately identify index lesions and cancers within the prostate? 2) Appropriate follow-up of patients treated with focal therapy and 3) How to detect recurrent/persistent disease? The introduction of multi-parametric (MP) MRI (T2w, dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE), Diffusion (DWI)) has allowed for (1) improved detection sensitivity and specificity for CaP localization, and (2) evaluating treatment response in the prostate. However there exists a need for (1) novel computational image analysis tools to quantitatively integrate MP-MRI parameters for improved CaP classification in vivo and (2) non-rigid registration tools for enabling targeted therapy and evaluation of post-treatment changes.  In this study we will employ sophisticated computer vision, image analysis, computer assisted diagnostic (CAD) and deformable registration tools in conjunction with MP-MRI to be used in conjunction with a small clinical trial involving 40 patients with documented CaP for (a) automated delineation of tumor regions on pre-treatment MP-MRI to thereby identify the specific regions for ablation via LITT, and (b) identify and delineate locally recurrent disease within and outside the ablation zone for post-LITT evaluation. Regions identified via CAD on pre-LITT MRI will be targeted for therapy, while on post-LITT MP-MRI, regions identified as being suspicious for CaP recurrence (on account of large changes in MR imaging markers) will be evaluated via needle core biopsy. The tools developed in this project will be integrated into a practical and feasible treatment paradigm for focal treatment of low-risk localized CaP which will allow patients to avoid the complications associated with radical whole-gland therapy. This inter-disciplinary, translational project combines engineering expertise in terms of CAD on MP-MRI, multimodal image registration and machine learning and clinical expertise in interventional radiology, prostate MRI, and MRI guided focal therapy.          In this study we will leverage sophisticated computer vision, image analysis, computer assisted diagnostic and deformable registration tools in conjunction with multi-parametric (MP) MRI in prostate cancer (CaP) patients for (a) automated delineation of tumor regions on pre-treatment MP-MRI and thereby identify the specific regions for ablation via laser induced interstitial thermal therapy (LITT), and (b) identify and delineate locally recurrent disease within and outside the ablation zone for post-LITT evaluation.

"Quantitative PET/CT Analysis to Improve Evaluation of Tumor Response     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to develop and validate a quantitative Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) image analysis framework to improve the evaluation of esophageal tumor response to chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. In Aim 1, we will extract comprehensive spatial and temporal features of a tumor from PET/CT images and evaluate their ability in predicting tumor response to CRT. These features will quantify the spatial characteristics of a tumor along with their changes due to CRT, adding a great amount of information to the current non-volumetric PET/CT response measures. Also, we will use image registration techniques to align pre-CRT images with post-CRT images, making it possible to quantify the spatial changes at the original tumor site. In Aim 2, we will construct and test reliable predictive models of tumo response to CRT using machine learning techniques with spatial- temporal PET/CT features, clinical parameters and demographics as input. The models will identify an optimal subset of predictive features and utilize PET and CT information in chorus. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel multi-modality adaptive region-growing algorithm for tumor delineation in PET/CT. We will compare the accuracy and precision of the resulting predictive models against those in which tumor is delineated using conventional methods (manual contouring or thresholding). This comparison will help us understand to what degree the prediction of tumor response depends on the tumor delineation methods. Finally, we will use pathologic response and survival as the end points and ground truth to cross-validate each predictive model. If all aims are achieved, the proposed PET/CT image analysis framework may provide a highly accurate diagnostic tool. This, will complement other diagnostic tests in assisting physicians in making a treatment decision to more appropriately select patients for surgery, thus avoiding the mortality and morbidity of surgery in responders for whom surgery can be safely deferred; while improving local control and survival in non- responders for whom surgery should be considered. Therefore, this work has the potential to improve outcomes by safely deferring surgery which will improve our locally advanced esophageal cancer patient's quality of life while simultaneously reducing costs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose to develop and validate a quantitative Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) image analysis framework to improve the evaluation of esophageal tumor response to chemoradiotherapy.

"Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization for Rapid IMRT and VMAT Treatment Planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has revolutionized the treatment of cancers in the last decade, since it can tightly conform and escalate radiation dose to a tumor while simultaneously protecting nearby radiation- sensitive normal tissues, resulting in better local control and fewer post-treatment complications than previous techniques. However, the process of obtaining a clinically acceptable IMRT plan for a difficult site is still extremely slow, requiring many hours of a busy expert's time in a manual trial-and-error loop of parameter adjustment. The goal of this project is to drastically reduce the amount of time to obtain a clinically acceptable IMRT plan using a new automated method that directly applies constrained optimization in a computationally tractable and clinically meaningful way. The hypothesis is that clinical treatment planning times using this technique will be reduced from several hours to a matter of minutes.  The new approach, called ROCO (Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization) translates well-established concepts from optimization and machine learning theory to the novel application of IMRT planning, exploiting the speed and ease of unconstrained optimizations and introducing a dimensionality reduction step that makes true constrained optimization tractable. The Specific Aims of the proposal are to (1) apply Reduced-Order Con- strained Optimization to IMRT planning for non-small cell lung cancers and nasopharynx cancers, where the planning process is highly time-consuming; (2) develop and extend the Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization paradigm to a promising IMRT variant called Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) for the prostate site, which is currently nearly clinically intractable to plan; and (3) integrate the new tools into the clinical IMRT planning process at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, using a powered study to verify the hypothesis that the proposed method significantly improves planning speed. The experiments will be designed in consultation with an expert clinical treatment planner and biostatistician, and carefully validated using anonymized data from approximately 50 patients for each site.  The main benefit of the proposed approach is to drastically reduce planning times, which is critical if IMRT and VMAT are to reach their full potential in clinical application. In a busy clinic, long planning times place a severe stress on available resources, and can result in treatment delays, acceptance of sub-optimal plans or - in the worst case - errors due to time pressure. In the longer term, the proposed approach will provide deeper insight into the critical elements of the dose optimization problem, significantly reduce the trial-and-error effort characteristic of current IMRT planning, and reduce subjectivity in treatment plan selection.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an extremely promising cancer treatment, but currently requires many hours of an expert treatment planner's time to obtain a plan that meets all the clinical constraints specified by the physician. This proposal describes a new, automatic method for treatment plan optimization that is very fast, requiring only minutes to produce a plan that directly meets all the physician's constraints, potentially saving much time for a busy clinic.

"Decision support for dose prescription in radiation treatment planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent advances in radiation therapy [1], such as Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) and Image-Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT), offer the ability to maximize tumor control while reducing the risk of radiation-induced damage to adjacent normal tissue. Typically, radiation therapy involves three phases: (1) prescription - where radiation oncologists (physicians) specify the dose constraints for targets and organs at risk (OAR); (2) planning - where treatment planners (physicists, dosimetrists) determine the treatment parameters to achieve the prescribed dose constraints; and (3) treatment - where therapists carry out the plan to treat the patients. In current practice, radiation oncologists typically draw on a variety of sources for dose prescription, including the 1991 ""Emami"" paper [8] on normal tissue tolerance, updated guidance from QUANTEC, other data in journals and texts, and their personal experiences. While these provide a general understanding of the dependence of normal tissue complication on dose distribution or the upper limits of the organ tolerance in populations of patients, their application to an individual patient is less certain and precise. Application of data and guidelines that are available in the literature is further complicated by the fact that this information is available only as narrative texts, tables and charts that are difficult to quantitatively integrate into clinical practice. Furthermore, the existing guidelines do not consider patient specific information regarding the ideal dose distribution achievable at individual treatments [9]. Radiation oncologists are frequently forced to make difficult prescription decisions by synthesizing available population level guidelines, personal experience, and their understanding of the specific patient needs on an ad hoc basis. Our overarching goal is to improve outcome by providing evidence-based decision support for radiation oncologists, planners, and therapists in every phase of the treatment process. In this project we propose to develop practical and clinically useful decision support tools to help radiation oncologists prescribe patient- specific optimal dose constraints. The specific aims are (1) Provide radiation oncologists with reliable predictions of patient-specific dose distributions achievable for the patient's anatomy and tumor volume; and (2) Provide radiation oncologists with intuitive tools that integrate patient-specific dose predictions with population-based dose guidelines to support prescription decision making. We believe the technologies developed in this project will not only improve the quality of radiotherapy prescriptions but also reduce planning time with optimal dose constraints and improve clinical outcomes.         In this project we propose to develop practical and clinically useful decision support tools to help radiation oncologists prescribe patient-specific optimal dose constraints. The technologies developed in this project will not only improve the quality of radiotherapy prescriptions but also reduce planning time with optimal dose constraints and improve clinical outcomes.

"Software to facilitate multimode, multiscale fused data for Pathology and Radiolo    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical informatics from the macro- to micro-scale is increasingly available for a range of detection/diagnosis/theragnostic applications tailored to each patient's history and current condition. Prostatic adenocarcinoma (CAP) is the second most common malignancy among men with an estimated 220,000 new cases in the USA in 2008. With the advent of multi-parametric high resolution (3 Tesla (T)) prostate MRI, providing anatomic, biochemical, and physiologic information, it has become increasingly important to identify the potential value of this information in pre-operative or pre-therapeutic CAP screening. However, in vivo prostate MRI lacks the resolution and ground truth diagnostic accuracy histopathological examination of biopsy cores provides. A first step toward getting prostate MRI for CAP into the clinic would be validating the information provided from MR at the cellular level. However, validating MRI against histological ground truth currently lacks the means to link the information provided by radiological imaging and pathology seamlessly. This is primarily due to a lack of interoperability between informatics representations and tools. One missing element, for instance, is robust and accurate image registration tools to align the multi-modal volumetric data sets. The overarching goal of this collaborative project between the University of Pennsylvania, Rutgers University, and Siemens Corporate Research is to develop and evaluate multi-modal image analysis and machine learning techniques within a software framework that will enable efficient analysis, correlation, and interpretation of multi-functional, multi-resolution patient data. The availability of these multi-modal, multi- scale analysis tools will enable alignment of radiology and pathological data which in turn will (a) enable building and validation of supervised computerized decision support systems for detection and grading of CAP from radiology and pathology data and (b) building meta-classifiers for CAP by integrating multi- modal, multi-scale disease signatures. Such a set of prostate-specific informatics tools promises clinical benefits including improved patient prognoses, more accurate disease diagnoses, and therapeutic recommendations. More generally, the tools developed as part of this project will also enable radiologic/pathologic studies in other disease entities. The specific goals of this project are 1) to develop cross-platform, open source, grid-enabled annotation, image analysis and image registration tools that will enable cross modality validation of radiology data (multi-functional 3 T prostate MRI) with expert histopathological annotation of prostatectomy specimens and provide independent computer-aided predictions of cancer extent and grade on radiology and histopathology, 2) curate an open source caGRID- connected database of prostate MRI and histopathological specimens that will enable development of quantitative signatures for detection and grading of CAP across multiple scales and imaging modalities.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a software tool kit (based on the XIP application from Siemens corporation) that will allow scientists to study prostate cancer by combining data from multiple imaging modalities (radiology and pathology) with molecular methodologies (including proteins, genes, epigenetic data). The results of this fused and combined data sets will allow scientists to create a more robust system based view of prostate cancer which allow prediction of diagnosis, follow outcomes of therapeutic treatment and facilitate discovery of new treatment options         ","Software to facilitate multimode, multiscale fused data for Pathology and Radiolo",8512667,R01CA136535,"['Active Learning', 'Algorithms', 'American Cancer Society', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Biochemical', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Gene Proteins', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Premalignant', 'Procedures', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Adenocarcinoma', 'Prostatectomy', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'cancer imaging', 'computerized', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease diagnosis', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interoperability', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'radiologist', 'repository', 'screening', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2013,569321,0.008784417111711308
"Reliable Human-Model Observers for Emission Tomography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall objective is to develop numerical observers for dependable technology evaluations in emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) are the primary clinical modalities for imaging many types of cancer. However, early de- tection often presents the best chances of surviving cancer whereas these imaging modalities have limited diagnostic utility for small tumors. Systematic task-based developmental assessments could facilitate early identification of promising new technology for improving the diagnostic capabilities of these modalities. Yet, assessments with human observers are generally impractical for developmental use. Moreover, available mathematical models (or numerical observers) intended to predict human performance-what we refer to as human-model observers-present significant limits, including con- straints on the types of diagnostic tasks that can be considered. Partly because of these constraints, existing human-model observers frequently require revalidation given any change to the imaging pro- cess. Our approach to observer development is founded on the concept of task equivalence, whereby the task for the numerical observer mirrors the desired clinical task as closely as possible. In this grant, we propose a novel observer framework that is influenced by descriptions of radiologists' visual-search (VS) processes, in which an initial global scan of an image identifies candidate locations deserving closer inspection. We shall use the VS paradigm to investigate the hypotheses that task equivalence i) can lead to a human-observer model that reliably generalizes to a wide range of diagnostic tasks, and ii) is necessary to ensure truly relevant task-based evaluations. We shall test these hypotheses through observer studies with fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) whole-body PET and SPECT In-111 imaging of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). A state-of-the-art model observer for developmental stud- ies should be capable of detection-localization tasks, and our observer studies will be analyzed with jackknife FROC (JAFROC) methodology. The specific aims of this work are to: 1) determine what features of FDG-PET image slices attract initial human-observer attention; 2) develop a VS numerical observer for tumor detection-localization tasks in FDG-PET; 3) test the VS observer against humans in a JAFROC detection-localization study featuring hybrid PET images; 4) investigate generalizations of the VS observer to SPECT and 3D detection-localization tasks; and 5) compare system optimiza- tions for oncologic SPECT obtained from the VS and existing numerical observers. The application is optimization of a parallel-hole collimator design for In-111 NET imaging.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomog- raphy (SPECT) has a significant role in cancer diagnosis and management.

"Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  Modern radiation therapy treatment planning relies on volumetric (CT, or sometimes MRI) imaging to determine tumor location and spread. In addition, radiation oncologists treating head and neck cancer have long used a specific endoscopy - nasopharyngoscopy - to augment the treatment planning volumetric scan. In endoscopy, a thin, flexible light-pipe with a camera is inserted into the patient to obtain optical videos. Endoscopy is done because it is clear to the experienced clinician that direct visualization of a tumor and the surrounding anatomy can reveal valuable information not seen on CT or MRI scans. However, there is currently no way for the clinician to delineate the tumor volume on the endoscopic video and have that information placed correctly into the CT dataset used for treatment planning. Also, there is currently no way to view a combined CT/video dataset. Such a registration has not yet been accomplished in part because of the formidable problems of accurately registering a video taken during nasopharyngoscopy with a planning CT scan. In this proposal we will create a new method to register CT scans with endoscopic videos to produce a fused representation that can then displayed to the clinician to improve radiation treatment planning. To accomplish this, we will further develop and integrate methods of deformable registration, mechanical modeling, motion estimation, computer vision, and 3D interactive display. With such software, radiation treatment planning will have an entirely new and complementary source of information with which to determine tumor extent. Although outside the direct scope of this project, we believe that this technology can be extended to other parts of human anatomy and can be useful for surgical planning as well as radiation treatment planning.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop advanced image processing and display technologies and integrate them in such a way as to allow a clinician to simultaneously view fused internal photographs of the patient's throat and voice box along with the corresponding CT scans. Such a system will result in better tumor targeting for cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment of that part of the body. More accurate treatment will likely result in a highe cure rate for these cancers.            ",Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning,8439269,R01CA158925,"['Anatomy', 'Body part', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Endoscopy', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Larynx', 'Light', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nasopharyngoscopy', 'Nose', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Physical Examination', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Probability', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Relative (related person)', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'data structure', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'public health relevance', 'software development', 'statistics', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2013,306421,0.04719227496238995
"Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers are heterogeneous in biology among patients, tumors in the same patient, and within tumors. As a result, they respond differently to therapy per patient, per tumor and within tumors. Different radiotracers and imaging modalities provide information about different aspects of biology and the physio-metabolic environments of the cancer. As a result, a single modality or radiotracer may not provide sufficient information to predict or assess response to therapy. We hypothesize that improved prediction and assessment of response can thus be obtained by combining quantitative image-derived parameters obtained from multiple imaging modalities or radiotracers. We propose to develop, optimize, and validate approaches for combining multiple image-derived parameters obtained from quantitative imaging procedures in order to optimally predict and assess treatment response. In particular, we propose to combine quantitative metrics from PET/CT, SPECT/CT, and MRI. We will first individually optimize the protocols, acquisition parameters, and imaging methods in order to get the most accurate and reliable parameters to combine. Optimally combining the parameters from different modalities requires knowledge of the reproducibility (precision) of the individual quantitative imaging parameters. We will thus use literature search, phantom studies, realistic simulations, and repeated patient studies to characterize the accuracy and precision of the individual quantitative imaging methods. We will then develop methods to combine the metrics to predict or assess treatment response per patient, per tumor and intra-tumor. We will apply and evaluate these methods in three clinical trials: dynamic and static FDG and FIT PET/CT to assess lung cancer response to cytotoxic chemotherapy; PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI in breast cancer response; and SPECT/CT, PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI to predict response of brain tumors to anti-angiogenic therapy. In these trials imaging parameters and their signatures will be linked to histology or survival outcomes to provide validation of the combined imaging parameter metrics.          n/a",Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy,8532654,U01CA140204,"['Albumins', 'Anatomy', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors', 'Animal Model', 'Biology', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cellularity', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cytotoxic Chemotherapy', 'Data', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methionine', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'PET/CT scan', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Systemic disease', 'Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate', 'Therapeutic', 'Tracer', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Volume', 'Validation', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'radiotracer', 'response', 'simulation', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'text searching', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2013,625194,0.013468348011283007
"Real-Time MRI Motion Correction System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MOTIVATION - Motion remains one of the most frequent contributors to image artifacts in MR studies.  The motion susceptibility of MRI is well-known and has spawned a number of elegant navigation techniques.  These methods, however, are tailored to specific MR acquisitions that require modified k-space trajectories or the acquisition of additional MR data, and most are unable to correct certain types of motion, for example, through-plane motion.  Moreover, motion correction has been focused on specific families of sequences, but no generally applicable approach currently exists.  Certain patient populations, such as pediatric or geriatric patients, are more likely to move than others.  In pediatric imaging, anesthesia is used to control motion, adding substantially to exam costs and patient risks.  A sequence-independent, autonomous and prospective motion correction system could greatly improve image quality for a wide spectrum of MR examinations.  For pediatric imaging, in particular, we anticipate reduced reliance on anesthesia to control patient motion.  AIMS - We will be focusing on three independent specific aims (carried out in parallel and completed within 4 years), with corresponding subaims that we believe are important for establishing the technical/scientific merit and to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed R&D efforts for our real-time adaptive motion correction approach.  Specifically, these aims are:  (1) to develop and evaluate a coil-mounted MR-compatible tracking device for routine clinical use; (2) to integrate pose tracking into real-time MRI; and (3) to validate our real-time motion correction system in volunteers and patients.  METHODS -In Aim 1 we will improve the methods for computer-vision-based pose estimation inside an MR scanner and build an MR-compatible coil-mounted pose tracker that can be used in clinical routine examinations.  In Aim 2 we will focus on reducing the latency between pose changes happening and the MR scanner reacting to these pose changes, and on building a software library for the MR pulse sequence development that allows one to implement real-time motion correction into all MR pulse sequences.  In Aim 3 we will perform a thorough evaluation of our system on 60 volunteers (30 adults and 30 children) and 120 patients (80 adults and 40 children).  SIGNIFICANCE - The impact of our technology has several facets.  First, it will improve patient care by reducing the number of MR images with compromised quality because of motion artifacts.  Especially because of the increasing reliance on MR Images as a primary means of diagnosis, this will reduce the number of misdiagnoses.  Secondly, this technology will help to lower the high national spending on imaging by dramatically improving the efficiency of MRI scanners.  Finally, it will improve patient comfort by reducing the need for repeat sequences, as well as reduce the necessity of sedation aimed at keeping the patient still.  Overall, this technology will have a significant impact on MRI both in clinical practice and basic science research.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Synopsis Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.  This is not only of increasing concern due to the aging population and its associated diseases, but also in children and patients who are simply too sick to remain still during an exam.  This proposal aims to build an optical tracking system and methods to adapt MRI pulse sequences to changes in patient pose in real time.  The project leverages on previous work from an R21 project in which a prototype system was successfully built.  Specifically, the aims are to (i) introduce innovative improvements to the existing prototype, making the system suitable for use in clinical routine, (ii) modify the optical tracking system to be compatible with multiple MR sequences, and (iii) perform clinical evaluation.  Our real-time technique is a unique and innovative solution that will improve MRI image quality and thus patient care, and will address the escalating burden of imaging costs on the health care system.

"Prostate-cancer Imaging by Combined Ultrasound and Magnetic-resonance Parameters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance to detect PCa; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project is highly significant because it addresses a major health problem in the United States and other developed countries. The project will overcome the current inability of established clinical-imaging method to image PCa reliably by combining the capabilities of advanced ultrasound (US) and magnetic-resonance (MR) techniques in a clinically effective manner. The proposed approach will exploit the sensitivity of US to mechanical properties of tissue on a microscopic scale with the sensitivity of MR to chemical constituents of tissue and its ability to sense blood distribution. Each of these modalities senses different and independent properties of tissue and has shown encouraging potential for improved imaging of PCa when used alone; combining parameters derived from each modality can provide far superior sensitivity and specificity for PCa. We will combine US and MR parameters using advanced classifiers such as artificial neural networks and support-vector machines. These classifiers already have produced ROC-curve areas of 0.91 for advanced US methods, and the MR methods have demonstrated equivalent ROC-curve areas in many studies. We will embody the combined capabilities in specifications for a prototype imaging system that can generate prostate tissue-typing images (TTIs) in real-time for targeting biopsies or planning treatment in the operating room or in an off-line setting. The latest Logiq E9 instrument currently being produced by GE already has a capability for fusing previously obtained MR images with US images in real time, which provides an existing framework for combining US and MR parameters and generating real-time TTIs. Successfully generating reliable prostate TTIs based on combined US and MR parameters will represent a quantum advance in PCa management by enabling significant improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of PCa.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project will combine attributes of advanced ultrasound and magnetic-resonance techniques and embody them in a prototype imaging system capable of generating novel tissue-type images that reliably depict PCa in real-time.

"Noninvasive imaging-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to establish a strategy that will make neuronal electrical signaling detectable via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a whole-brain level. Our approach is built on the novel concept of using cell-adhesive micron-scale electronic devices to transduce neuronal potentials across the brain into magnetic field fluctuations. As part of our validation of these voltage-sensing microprobes, we also propose to implement a new, scalable method for simultaneous recording of MRI and electrophysiological data. The methods we propose to develop will be broadly applicable to problems in neurobiology, and will transform neuroscientists' ability to study integrative functions of the brain. Our microprobe approach will also help establish a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine and molecular imaging, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology. Recent work has dem- onstrated that micron-scale electrodes, coated with cell-adhesive molecules and juxtaposed against cultured cells allow recording of millivolt-scale action potentials, comparable to intracellular recordings. The current induced in a microelectrode can be converted into a modest, transient magnetic field if it is channeled into an inductor. In Specific Aim 1, we will model the magnetic fields produced by feasible currents in spiral or solenoidal microcoils of defined geometry, compute predicted effects on MRI signal amplitude and phase as a function of microprobe distribution, and fabricate the microprobes themselves. Preliminary calculations indicate that localized, transient fields of about 10 nT could be produced in individual 10-turn microcoils of 1 5m diameter. Magnetic fields of this order are greater than endogenous neuronal fields detected in tech- nologies like magnetoencephalography, and have been shown previously to be measurable by MRI in some contexts. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the ability of our microprobes to report action potentials from neu- ronal populations in MRI. The microdevices wil first be applied to cultured neurons or neural tissue slices and placed in an MRI scanner. Data series will be obtained using multiple protocols to detect variations of MRI signal due to variations in neuronal activity. If experiments in culture are successful, microprobes will be site-specifically injected into the cerebral cortex of anesthetized rats, and tested in an somatosensory stimu- lation paradigm. In Specific Aim 3, we will establish a simultaneous MRI and conventional electrophysiology approach to validate the novel MRI voltage probes directly. Performing electrophysiology in an MRI scanner is complicated by artifacts induced by the scanning hardware, in particular due to switched gradient fields. To circumvent this problem, we will measure neuronal potentials using differential recording from pairs of channels on tetrodes or modified tetrodes. Once the in-scanner recording method has been refined, MRI- based and conventional electrophysiology data will be obtained and compared to assess performance of the voltage-sensing microprobes, and to guide further improvements, if necessary.         Noninvasive MRI-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices will have high impact in biology, and specifically in brain research, both through applications to the study of neurological disease and as tools for the analysis of neural network function in basic neuroscience. The microprobes we propose to develop represent a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology.

"Decision support with MRI for targeting, evaluating laser ablation for prostate c     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For a growing population of low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer (CaP) patients, active surveillance may be biologically or psychologically undesirable. Yet the short- and long-term complications and co-morbidities associated with radical whole-organ therapies (e.g. intensity modulated radiation therapy) are still associated with a risk of treatment-related morbidity. With radical whole gland therapies, in certain patients who are more sensitive to radiation treatment, high dosage spots in the rectum and in the bladder can lead to complications including chronic rectal bleeding, diarrhea, and urinary symptoms such as cystitis. Laser induced interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a novel form of controlled, targeted thermal ablation that may offer measurable advantages over other ablative therapies for focal prostate therapy. Because LITT is MRI compatible, it enables an imaging advantage over other surgical or ablation techniques that utilize transrectal ultrasound to target and monitor treatment. However successful adoption of focal therapy for the treatment of CaP will hinge on several critical issues: 1) Can we accurately identify index lesions and cancers within the prostate? 2) Appropriate follow-up of patients treated with focal therapy and 3) How to detect recurrent/persistent disease? The introduction of multi-parametric (MP) MRI (T2w, dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE), Diffusion (DWI)) has allowed for (1) improved detection sensitivity and specificity for CaP localization, and (2) evaluating treatment response in the prostate. However there exists a need for (1) novel computational image analysis tools to quantitatively integrate MP-MRI parameters for improved CaP classification in vivo and (2) non-rigid registration tools for enabling targeted therapy and evaluation of post-treatment changes.  In this study we will employ sophisticated computer vision, image analysis, computer assisted diagnostic (CAD) and deformable registration tools in conjunction with MP-MRI to be used in conjunction with a small clinical trial involving 40 patients with documented CaP for (a) automated delineation of tumor regions on pre-treatment MP-MRI to thereby identify the specific regions for ablation via LITT, and (b) identify and delineate locally recurrent disease within and outside the ablation zone for post-LITT evaluation. Regions identified via CAD on pre-LITT MRI will be targeted for therapy, while on post-LITT MP-MRI, regions identified as being suspicious for CaP recurrence (on account of large changes in MR imaging markers) will be evaluated via needle core biopsy. The tools developed in this project will be integrated into a practical and feasible treatment paradigm for focal treatment of low-risk localized CaP which will allow patients to avoid the complications associated with radical whole-gland therapy. This inter-disciplinary, translational project combines engineering expertise in terms of CAD on MP-MRI, multimodal image registration and machine learning and clinical expertise in interventional radiology, prostate MRI, and MRI guided focal therapy.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this study we will leverage sophisticated computer vision, image analysis, computer assisted diagnostic and deformable registration tools in conjunction with multi-parametric (MP) MRI in prostate cancer (CaP) patients for (a) automated delineation of tumor regions on pre-treatment MP-MRI and thereby identify the specific regions for ablation via laser induced interstitial thermal therapy (LITT), and (b) identify and delineate locally recurrent disease within and outside the ablation zone for post-LITT evaluation.

"High-Throughput Computing for a Multi-Plan Framework in Radiotherapy  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Computerized planning for radiation delivery via either external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or intensity- modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) from linear accelerators is a complex process involving a large amount of input data and vast numbers of decision variables. Such large-scale combinatorial optimization problems are typically intractable for conventional approaches such as the direct application of the best available commercial algorithms, and thus specialized methods that take advantage of problem structure are required. Radiation treatment planning (RTP) problems are further complicated by the fact that they are multi-objective, that is, the RTP optimization process must take into account a trade-off between the competing goals of delivering appropriate doses to the tumor and avoiding the delivery of harmful radiation to nearby healthy organs. The goal of this proposal is to harness distributive computing via the Condor system for High Throughput Computing (HTC) within an RTP environment. The specific aims for this proposal are: 1) To develop a Nested Partitions (NP) framework that guides a global search process for optimal IMRT delivery parameters using HTC. 2) To develop parallel HTC-based linear programming (LP) methods to efficiently solve the dose optimization problem in IMRT for each given set of beam angles or beam apertures. (3) To exploit a high-throughput computing (HTC) environment and the developed NP/LP/segmentation framework to efficiently generate multiple plans for each given patient case. (4) To couple this multi-plan framework with a decision support system (DSS) that includes planning surface models, a graphical-user-interface (GUI) and machine learning tools to prediction OAR complication in order to aid in the ranking and selection of the generated treatment plans. This proposal requires a multi-disciplinary approach that is best conducted within the framework of the Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology program announcement. It brings together an interdisciplinary team of investigators with expertise in medical physics, mathematical programming, industrial engineering and clinical radiation oncology that is crucial to the development of the proposed multi- plan framework using HTC in radiation therapy.  PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to develop a multi-dimensional platform for sophisticated treatment planning of radiation delivery. It will develop novel algorithms that will enable generation of superior treatment plans with the added advantage of increasing the speed of treatment planning. Further, it will allow physicians to know beforehand the quality of the treatment plan relative to the multiple treatment objectives and be able to determine the treatment complication scenario beforehand.",High-Throughput Computing for a Multi-Plan Framework in Radiotherapy,8271284,R01CA130814,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computational Science', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'External Beam Radiation Therapy', 'Generations', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Accelerator Radiotherapy Systems', 'Linear Programming', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation therapy', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Simulate', 'Solutions', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'base', 'cluster computing', 'combinatorial', 'computer science', 'computerized', 'computing resources', 'direct application', 'graphical user interface', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'research clinical testing', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2012,297329,0.033485515899886444
"Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization for Rapid IMRT and VMAT Treatment Planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has revolutionized the treatment of cancers in the last decade, since it can tightly conform and escalate radiation dose to a tumor while simultaneously protecting nearby radiation- sensitive normal tissues, resulting in better local control and fewer post-treatment complications than previous techniques. However, the process of obtaining a clinically acceptable IMRT plan for a difficult site is still extremely slow, requiring many hours of a busy expert's time in a manual trial-and-error loop of parameter adjustment. The goal of this project is to drastically reduce the amount of time to obtain a clinically acceptable IMRT plan using a new automated method that directly applies constrained optimization in a computationally tractable and clinically meaningful way. The hypothesis is that clinical treatment planning times using this technique will be reduced from several hours to a matter of minutes.  The new approach, called ROCO (Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization) translates well-established concepts from optimization and machine learning theory to the novel application of IMRT planning, exploiting the speed and ease of unconstrained optimizations and introducing a dimensionality reduction step that makes true constrained optimization tractable. The Specific Aims of the proposal are to (1) apply Reduced-Order Con- strained Optimization to IMRT planning for non-small cell lung cancers and nasopharynx cancers, where the planning process is highly time-consuming; (2) develop and extend the Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization paradigm to a promising IMRT variant called Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) for the prostate site, which is currently nearly clinically intractable to plan; and (3) integrate the new tools into the clinical IMRT planning process at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, using a powered study to verify the hypothesis that the proposed method significantly improves planning speed. The experiments will be designed in consultation with an expert clinical treatment planner and biostatistician, and carefully validated using anonymized data from approximately 50 patients for each site.  The main benefit of the proposed approach is to drastically reduce planning times, which is critical if IMRT and VMAT are to reach their full potential in clinical application. In a busy clinic, long planning times place a severe stress on available resources, and can result in treatment delays, acceptance of sub-optimal plans or - in the worst case - errors due to time pressure. In the longer term, the proposed approach will provide deeper insight into the critical elements of the dose optimization problem, significantly reduce the trial-and-error effort characteristic of current IMRT planning, and reduce subjectivity in treatment plan selection.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an extremely promising cancer treatment, but currently requires many hours of an expert treatment planner's time to obtain a plan that meets all the clinical constraints specified by the physician. This proposal describes a new, automatic method for treatment plan optimization that is very fast, requiring only minutes to produce a plan that directly meets all the physician's constraints, potentially saving much time for a busy clinic.

"Decision support for dose prescription in radiation treatment planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent advances in radiation therapy [1], such as Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) and Image-Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT), offer the ability to maximize tumor control while reducing the risk of radiation-induced damage to adjacent normal tissue. Typically, radiation therapy involves three phases: (1) prescription - where radiation oncologists (physicians) specify the dose constraints for targets and organs at risk (OAR); (2) planning - where treatment planners (physicists, dosimetrists) determine the treatment parameters to achieve the prescribed dose constraints; and (3) treatment - where therapists carry out the plan to treat the patients. In current practice, radiation oncologists typically draw on a variety of sources for dose prescription, including the 1991 ""Emami"" paper [8] on normal tissue tolerance, updated guidance from QUANTEC, other data in journals and texts, and their personal experiences. While these provide a general understanding of the dependence of normal tissue complication on dose distribution or the upper limits of the organ tolerance in populations of patients, their application to an individual patient is less certain and precise. Application of data and guidelines that are available in the literature is further complicated by the fact that this information is available only as narrative texts, tables and charts that are difficult to quantitatively integrate into clinical practice. Furthermore, the existing guidelines do not consider patient specific information regarding the ideal dose distribution achievable at individual treatments [9]. Radiation oncologists are frequently forced to make difficult prescription decisions by synthesizing available population level guidelines, personal experience, and their understanding of the specific patient needs on an ad hoc basis. Our overarching goal is to improve outcome by providing evidence-based decision support for radiation oncologists, planners, and therapists in every phase of the treatment process. In this project we propose to develop practical and clinically useful decision support tools to help radiation oncologists prescribe patient- specific optimal dose constraints. The specific aims are (1) Provide radiation oncologists with reliable predictions of patient-specific dose distributions achievable for the patient's anatomy and tumor volume; and (2) Provide radiation oncologists with intuitive tools that integrate patient-specific dose predictions with population-based dose guidelines to support prescription decision making. We believe the technologies developed in this project will not only improve the quality of radiotherapy prescriptions but also reduce planning time with optimal dose constraints and improve clinical outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In this project we propose to develop practical and clinically useful decision support tools to help radiation oncologists prescribe patient-specific optimal dose constraints.

"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase. Dementia has many possible underlying causes and several different causes are at work in most elderly demented subjects.

"Software to facilitate multimode, multiscale fused data for Pathology and Radiolo    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical informatics from the macro- to micro-scale is increasingly available for a range of detection/diagnosis/theragnostic applications tailored to each patient's history and current condition. Prostatic adenocarcinoma (CAP) is the second most common malignancy among men with an estimated 220,000 new cases in the USA in 2008. With the advent of multi-parametric high resolution (3 Tesla (T)) prostate MRI, providing anatomic, biochemical, and physiologic information, it has become increasingly important to identify the potential value of this information in pre-operative or pre-therapeutic CAP screening. However, in vivo prostate MRI lacks the resolution and ground truth diagnostic accuracy histopathological examination of biopsy cores provides. A first step toward getting prostate MRI for CAP into the clinic would be validating the information provided from MR at the cellular level. However, validating MRI against histological ground truth currently lacks the means to link the information provided by radiological imaging and pathology seamlessly. This is primarily due to a lack of interoperability between informatics representations and tools. One missing element, for instance, is robust and accurate image registration tools to align the multi-modal volumetric data sets. The overarching goal of this collaborative project between the University of Pennsylvania, Rutgers University, and Siemens Corporate Research is to develop and evaluate multi-modal image analysis and machine learning techniques within a software framework that will enable efficient analysis, correlation, and interpretation of multi-functional, multi-resolution patient data. The availability of these multi-modal, multi- scale analysis tools will enable alignment of radiology and pathological data which in turn will (a) enable building and validation of supervised computerized decision support systems for detection and grading of CAP from radiology and pathology data and (b) building meta-classifiers for CAP by integrating multi- modal, multi-scale disease signatures. Such a set of prostate-specific informatics tools promises clinical benefits including improved patient prognoses, more accurate disease diagnoses, and therapeutic recommendations. More generally, the tools developed as part of this project will also enable radiologic/pathologic studies in other disease entities. The specific goals of this project are 1) to develop cross-platform, open source, grid-enabled annotation, image analysis and image registration tools that will enable cross modality validation of radiology data (multi-functional 3 T prostate MRI) with expert histopathological annotation of prostatectomy specimens and provide independent computer-aided predictions of cancer extent and grade on radiology and histopathology, 2) curate an open source caGRID- connected database of prostate MRI and histopathological specimens that will enable development of quantitative signatures for detection and grading of CAP across multiple scales and imaging modalities.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a software tool kit (based on the XIP application from Siemens corporation) that will allow scientists to study prostate cancer by combining data from multiple imaging modalities (radiology and pathology) with molecular methodologies (including proteins, genes, epigenetic data).

"Reliable Human-Model Observers for Emission Tomography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall objective is to develop numerical observers for dependable technology evaluations in emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) are the primary clinical modalities for imaging many types of cancer. However, early de- tection often presents the best chances of surviving cancer whereas these imaging modalities have limited diagnostic utility for small tumors. Systematic task-based developmental assessments could facilitate early identification of promising new technology for improving the diagnostic capabilities of these modalities. Yet, assessments with human observers are generally impractical for developmental use. Moreover, available mathematical models (or numerical observers) intended to predict human performance-what we refer to as human-model observers-present significant limits, including con- straints on the types of diagnostic tasks that can be considered. Partly because of these constraints, existing human-model observers frequently require revalidation given any change to the imaging pro- cess. Our approach to observer development is founded on the concept of task equivalence, whereby the task for the numerical observer mirrors the desired clinical task as closely as possible. In this grant, we propose a novel observer framework that is influenced by descriptions of radiologists' visual-search (VS) processes, in which an initial global scan of an image identifies candidate locations deserving closer inspection. We shall use the VS paradigm to investigate the hypotheses that task equivalence i) can lead to a human-observer model that reliably generalizes to a wide range of diagnostic tasks, and ii) is necessary to ensure truly relevant task-based evaluations. We shall test these hypotheses through observer studies with fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) whole-body PET and SPECT In-111 imaging of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). A state-of-the-art model observer for developmental stud- ies should be capable of detection-localization tasks, and our observer studies will be analyzed with jackknife FROC (JAFROC) methodology. The specific aims of this work are to: 1) determine what features of FDG-PET image slices attract initial human-observer attention; 2) develop a VS numerical observer for tumor detection-localization tasks in FDG-PET; 3) test the VS observer against humans in a JAFROC detection-localization study featuring hybrid PET images; 4) investigate generalizations of the VS observer to SPECT and 3D detection-localization tasks; and 5) compare system optimiza- tions for oncologic SPECT obtained from the VS and existing numerical observers. The application is optimization of a parallel-hole collimator design for In-111 NET imaging.

"Decision support with MRI for targeting, evaluating laser ablation for prostate c     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For a growing population of low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer (CaP) patients, active surveillance may be biologically or psychologically undesirable. Yet the short- and long-term complications and co-morbidities associated with radical whole-organ therapies (e.g. intensity modulated radiation therapy) are still associated with a risk of treatment-related morbidity. With radical whole gland therapies, in certain patients who are more sensitive to radiation treatment, high dosage spots in the rectum and in the bladder can lead to complications including chronic rectal bleeding, diarrhea, and urinary symptoms such as cystitis. Laser induced interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a novel form of controlled, targeted thermal ablation that may offer measurable advantages over other ablative therapies for focal prostate therapy. Because LITT is MRI compatible, it enables an imaging advantage over other surgical or ablation techniques that utilize transrectal ultrasound to target and monitor treatment. However successful adoption of focal therapy for the treatment of CaP will hinge on several critical issues: 1) Can we accurately identify index lesions and cancers within the prostate? 2) Appropriate follow-up of patients treated with focal therapy and 3) How to detect recurrent/persistent disease? The introduction of multi-parametric (MP) MRI (T2w, dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE), Diffusion (DWI)) has allowed for (1) improved detection sensitivity and specificity for CaP localization, and (2) evaluating treatment response in the prostate. However there exists a need for (1) novel computational image analysis tools to quantitatively integrate MP-MRI parameters for improved CaP classification in vivo and (2) non-rigid registration tools for enabling targeted therapy and evaluation of post-treatment changes.  In this study we will employ sophisticated computer vision, image analysis, computer assisted diagnostic (CAD) and deformable registration tools in conjunction with MP-MRI to be used in conjunction with a small clinical trial involving 40 patients with documented CaP for (a) automated delineation of tumor regions on pre-treatment MP-MRI to thereby identify the specific regions for ablation via LITT, and (b) identify and delineate locally recurrent disease within and outside the ablation zone for post-LITT evaluation. Regions identified via CAD on pre-LITT MRI will be targeted for therapy, while on post-LITT MP-MRI, regions identified as being suspicious for CaP recurrence (on account of large changes in MR imaging markers) will be evaluated via needle core biopsy. The tools developed in this project will be integrated into a practical and feasible treatment paradigm for focal treatment of low-risk localized CaP which will allow patients to avoid the complications associated with radical whole-gland therapy. This inter-disciplinary, translational project combines engineering expertise in terms of CAD on MP-MRI, multimodal image registration and machine learning and clinical expertise in interventional radiology, prostate MRI, and MRI guided focal therapy.          In this study we will leverage sophisticated computer vision, image analysis, computer assisted diagnostic and deformable registration tools in conjunction with multi-parametric (MP) MRI in prostate cancer (CaP) patients for (a) automated delineation of tumor regions on pre-treatment MP-MRI and thereby identify the specific regions for ablation via laser induced interstitial thermal therapy (LITT), and (b) identify and delineate locally recurrent disease within and outside the ablation zone for post-LITT evaluation.

"Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers are heterogeneous in biology among patients, tumors in the same patient, and within tumors. As a result, they respond differently to therapy per patient, per tumor and within tumors. Different radiotracers and imaging modalities provide information about different aspects of biology and the physio-metabolic environments of the cancer. As a result, a single modality or radiotracer may not provide sufficient information to predict or assess response to therapy. We hypothesize that improved prediction and assessment of response can thus be obtained by combining quantitative image-derived parameters obtained from multiple imaging modalities or radiotracers. We propose to develop, optimize, and validate approaches for combining multiple image-derived parameters obtained from quantitative imaging procedures in order to optimally predict and assess treatment response. In particular, we propose to combine quantitative metrics from PET/CT, SPECT/CT, and MRI. We will first individually optimize the protocols, acquisition parameters, and imaging methods in order to get the most accurate and reliable parameters to combine. Optimally combining the parameters from different modalities requires knowledge of the reproducibility (precision) of the individual quantitative imaging parameters. We will thus use literature search, phantom studies, realistic simulations, and repeated patient studies to characterize the accuracy and precision of the individual quantitative imaging methods. We will then develop methods to combine the metrics to predict or assess treatment response per patient, per tumor and intra-tumor. We will apply and evaluate these methods in three clinical trials: dynamic and static FDG and FIT PET/CT to assess lung cancer response to cytotoxic chemotherapy; PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI in breast cancer response; and SPECT/CT, PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI to predict response of brain tumors to anti-angiogenic therapy. In these trials imaging parameters and their signatures will be linked to histology or survival outcomes to provide validation of the combined imaging parameter metrics.          n/a",Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy,8334502,U01CA140204,"['Albumins', 'Anatomy', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors', 'Animal Model', 'Biology', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cellularity', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cytotoxic Chemotherapy', 'Data', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methionine', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'PET/CT scan', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Systemic disease', 'Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate', 'Therapeutic', 'Tracer', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Volume', 'Validation', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'radiotracer', 'response', 'simulation', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'text searching', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2012,668129,0.013468348011283007
"Real-Time MRI Motion Correction System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MOTIVATION - Motion remains one of the most frequent contributors to image artifacts in MR studies.  The motion susceptibility of MRI is well-known and has spawned a number of elegant navigation techniques.  These methods, however, are tailored to specific MR acquisitions that require modified k-space trajectories or the acquisition of additional MR data, and most are unable to correct certain types of motion, for example, through-plane motion.  Moreover, motion correction has been focused on specific families of sequences, but no generally applicable approach currently exists.  Certain patient populations, such as pediatric or geriatric patients, are more likely to move than others.  In pediatric imaging, anesthesia is used to control motion, adding substantially to exam costs and patient risks.  A sequence-independent, autonomous and prospective motion correction system could greatly improve image quality for a wide spectrum of MR examinations.  For pediatric imaging, in particular, we anticipate reduced reliance on anesthesia to control patient motion.  AIMS - We will be focusing on three independent specific aims (carried out in parallel and completed within 4 years), with corresponding subaims that we believe are important for establishing the technical/scientific merit and to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed R&D efforts for our real-time adaptive motion correction approach.  Specifically, these aims are:  (1) to develop and evaluate a coil-mounted MR-compatible tracking device for routine clinical use; (2) to integrate pose tracking into real-time MRI; and (3) to validate our real-time motion correction system in volunteers and patients.  METHODS -In Aim 1 we will improve the methods for computer-vision-based pose estimation inside an MR scanner and build an MR-compatible coil-mounted pose tracker that can be used in clinical routine examinations.  In Aim 2 we will focus on reducing the latency between pose changes happening and the MR scanner reacting to these pose changes, and on building a software library for the MR pulse sequence development that allows one to implement real-time motion correction into all MR pulse sequences.  In Aim 3 we will perform a thorough evaluation of our system on 60 volunteers (30 adults and 30 children) and 120 patients (80 adults and 40 children).  SIGNIFICANCE - The impact of our technology has several facets.  First, it will improve patient care by reducing the number of MR images with compromised quality because of motion artifacts.  Especially because of the increasing reliance on MR Images as a primary means of diagnosis, this will reduce the number of misdiagnoses.  Secondly, this technology will help to lower the high national spending on imaging by dramatically improving the efficiency of MRI scanners.  Finally, it will improve patient comfort by reducing the need for repeat sequences, as well as reduce the necessity of sedation aimed at keeping the patient still.  Overall, this technology will have a significant impact on MRI both in clinical practice and basic science research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Synopsis Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.  This is not only of increasing concern due to the aging population and its associated diseases, but also in children and patients who are simply too sick to remain still during an exam.  This proposal aims to build an optical tracking system and methods to adapt MRI pulse sequences to changes in patient pose in real time.  The project leverages on previous work from an R21 project in which a prototype system was successfully built.  Specifically, the aims are to (i) introduce innovative improvements to the existing prototype, making the system suitable for use in clinical routine, (ii) modify the optical tracking system to be compatible with multiple MR sequences, and (iii) perform clinical evaluation.  Our real-time technique is a unique and innovative solution that will improve MRI image quality and thus patient care, and will address the escalating burden of imaging costs on the health care system.

"Prostate-cancer Imaging by Combined Ultrasound and Magnetic-resonance Parameters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance to detect PCa; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project is highly significant because it addresses a major health problem in the United States and other developed countries. The project will overcome the current inability of established clinical-imaging method to image PCa reliably by combining the capabilities of advanced ultrasound (US) and magnetic-resonance (MR) techniques in a clinically effective manner. The proposed approach will exploit the sensitivity of US to mechanical properties of tissue on a microscopic scale with the sensitivity of MR to chemical constituents of tissue and its ability to sense blood distribution. Each of these modalities senses different and independent properties of tissue and has shown encouraging potential for improved imaging of PCa when used alone; combining parameters derived from each modality can provide far superior sensitivity and specificity for PCa. We will combine US and MR parameters using advanced classifiers such as artificial neural networks and support-vector machines. These classifiers already have produced ROC-curve areas of 0.91 for advanced US methods, and the MR methods have demonstrated equivalent ROC-curve areas in many studies. We will embody the combined capabilities in specifications for a prototype imaging system that can generate prostate tissue-typing images (TTIs) in real-time for targeting biopsies or planning treatment in the operating room or in an off-line setting. The latest Logiq E9 instrument currently being produced by GE already has a capability for fusing previously obtained MR images with US images in real time, which provides an existing framework for combining US and MR parameters and generating real-time TTIs. Successfully generating reliable prostate TTIs based on combined US and MR parameters will represent a quantum advance in PCa management by enabling significant improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of PCa.

"Noninvasive imaging-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to establish a strategy that will make neuronal electrical signaling detectable via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a whole-brain level. Our approach is built on the novel concept of using cell-adhesive micron-scale electronic devices to transduce neuronal potentials across the brain into magnetic field fluctuations. As part of our validation of these voltage-sensing microprobes, we also propose to implement a new, scalable method for simultaneous recording of MRI and electrophysiological data. The methods we propose to develop will be broadly applicable to problems in neurobiology, and will transform neuroscientists' ability to study integrative functions of the brain. Our microprobe approach will also help establish a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine and molecular imaging, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology. Recent work has dem- onstrated that micron-scale electrodes, coated with cell-adhesive molecules and juxtaposed against cultured cells allow recording of millivolt-scale action potentials, comparable to intracellular recordings. The current induced in a microelectrode can be converted into a modest, transient magnetic field if it is channeled into an inductor. In Specific Aim 1, we will model the magnetic fields produced by feasible currents in spiral or solenoidal microcoils of defined geometry, compute predicted effects on MRI signal amplitude and phase as a function of microprobe distribution, and fabricate the microprobes themselves. Preliminary calculations indicate that localized, transient fields of about 10 nT could be produced in individual 10-turn microcoils of 1 5m diameter. Magnetic fields of this order are greater than endogenous neuronal fields detected in tech- nologies like magnetoencephalography, and have been shown previously to be measurable by MRI in some contexts. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the ability of our microprobes to report action potentials from neu- ronal populations in MRI. The microdevices wil first be applied to cultured neurons or neural tissue slices and placed in an MRI scanner. Data series will be obtained using multiple protocols to detect variations of MRI signal due to variations in neuronal activity. If experiments in culture are successful, microprobes will be site-specifically injected into the cerebral cortex of anesthetized rats, and tested in an somatosensory stimu- lation paradigm. In Specific Aim 3, we will establish a simultaneous MRI and conventional electrophysiology approach to validate the novel MRI voltage probes directly. Performing electrophysiology in an MRI scanner is complicated by artifacts induced by the scanning hardware, in particular due to switched gradient fields. To circumvent this problem, we will measure neuronal potentials using differential recording from pairs of channels on tetrodes or modified tetrodes. Once the in-scanner recording method has been refined, MRI- based and conventional electrophysiology data will be obtained and compared to assess performance of the voltage-sensing microprobes, and to guide further improvements, if necessary.         Noninvasive MRI-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices will have high impact in biology, and specifically in brain research, both through applications to the study of neurological disease and as tools for the analysis of neural network function in basic neuroscience. The microprobes we propose to develop represent a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology.

"High-Throughput Computing for a Multi-Plan Framework in Radiotherapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Computerized planning for radiation delivery via either external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or intensity- modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) from linear accelerators is a complex process involving a large amount of input data and vast numbers of decision variables. Such large-scale combinatorial optimization problems are typically intractable for conventional approaches such as the direct application of the best available commercial algorithms, and thus specialized methods that take advantage of problem structure are required. Radiation treatment planning (RTP) problems are further complicated by the fact that they are multi-objective, that is, the RTP optimization process must take into account a trade-off between the competing goals of delivering appropriate doses to the tumor and avoiding the delivery of harmful radiation to nearby healthy organs. The goal of this proposal is to harness distributive computing via the Condor system for High Throughput Computing (HTC) within an RTP environment. The specific aims for this proposal are: 1) To develop a Nested Partitions (NP) framework that guides a global search process for optimal IMRT delivery parameters using HTC. 2) To develop parallel HTC-based linear programming (LP) methods to efficiently solve the dose optimization problem in IMRT for each given set of beam angles or beam apertures. (3) To exploit a high-throughput computing (HTC) environment and the developed NP/LP/segmentation framework to efficiently generate multiple plans for each given patient case. (4) To couple this multi-plan framework with a decision support system (DSS) that includes planning surface models, a graphical-user-interface (GUI) and machine learning tools to prediction OAR complication in order to aid in the ranking and selection of the generated treatment plans. This proposal requires a multi-disciplinary approach that is best conducted within the framework of the Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology program announcement. It brings together an interdisciplinary team of investigators with expertise in medical physics, mathematical programming, industrial engineering and clinical radiation oncology that is crucial to the development of the proposed multi- plan framework using HTC in radiation therapy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to develop a multi-dimensional platform for sophisticated treatment planning of radiation delivery. It will develop novel algorithms that will enable generation of superior treatment plans with the added advantage of increasing the speed of treatment planning. Further, it will allow physicians to know beforehand the quality of the treatment plan relative to the multiple treatment objectives and be able to determine the treatment complication scenario beforehand.           PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to develop a multi-dimensional platform for sophisticated treatment planning of radiation delivery.

"Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization for Rapid IMRT and VMAT Treatment Planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has revolutionized the treatment of cancers in the last decade, since it can tightly conform and escalate radiation dose to a tumor while simultaneously protecting nearby radiation- sensitive normal tissues, resulting in better local control and fewer post-treatment complications than previous techniques. However, the process of obtaining a clinically acceptable IMRT plan for a difficult site is still extremely slow, requiring many hours of a busy expert's time in a manual trial-and-error loop of parameter adjustment. The goal of this project is to drastically reduce the amount of time to obtain a clinically acceptable IMRT plan using a new automated method that directly applies constrained optimization in a computationally tractable and clinically meaningful way. The hypothesis is that clinical treatment planning times using this technique will be reduced from several hours to a matter of minutes.  The new approach, called ROCO (Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization) translates well-established concepts from optimization and machine learning theory to the novel application of IMRT planning, exploiting the speed and ease of unconstrained optimizations and introducing a dimensionality reduction step that makes true constrained optimization tractable. The Specific Aims of the proposal are to (1) apply Reduced-Order Con- strained Optimization to IMRT planning for non-small cell lung cancers and nasopharynx cancers, where the planning process is highly time-consuming; (2) develop and extend the Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization paradigm to a promising IMRT variant called Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) for the prostate site, which is currently nearly clinically intractable to plan; and (3) integrate the new tools into the clinical IMRT planning process at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, using a powered study to verify the hypothesis that the proposed method significantly improves planning speed. The experiments will be designed in consultation with an expert clinical treatment planner and biostatistician, and carefully validated using anonymized data from approximately 50 patients for each site.  The main benefit of the proposed approach is to drastically reduce planning times, which is critical if IMRT and VMAT are to reach their full potential in clinical application. In a busy clinic, long planning times place a severe stress on available resources, and can result in treatment delays, acceptance of sub-optimal plans or - in the worst case - errors due to time pressure. In the longer term, the proposed approach will provide deeper insight into the critical elements of the dose optimization problem, significantly reduce the trial-and-error effort characteristic of current IMRT planning, and reduce subjectivity in treatment plan selection.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an extremely promising cancer treatment, but currently requires many hours of an expert treatment planner's time to obtain a plan that meets all the clinical constraints specified by the physician. This proposal describes a new, automatic method for treatment plan optimization that is very fast, requiring only minutes to produce a plan that directly meets all the physician's constraints, potentially saving much time for a busy clinic.           Project Narrative Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an extremely promising cancer treatment, but currently requires many hours of an expert treatment planner's time to obtain a plan that meets all the clinical constraints specified by the physician.

"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase. Dementia has many possible underlying causes and several different causes are at work in most elderly demented subjects. In this grant, we will use modern brain imaging to identify specific mechanisms underlying progression to dementia. n/a",Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging,8117482,R01AG011378,"['6-hydroxybenzothiazole', 'Abbreviations', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease Pathway', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Amyloidosis', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Applications Grants', 'Attenuated', 'Autopsy', 'Base of the Brain', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Correlation Studies', 'Critiques', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inositol', 'Label', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'N-acetylaspartate', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pittsburgh Compound-B', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scheme', 'Senile Plaques', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Spin Labels', 'Staging', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Syndrome', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'amyloid imaging', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'molecular imaging', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'population based', 'primary outcome', 'tool']",NIA,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2011,968365,-0.007621022209538727
"Software to facilitate multimode, multiscale fused data for Pathology and Radiolo    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical informatics from the macro- to micro-scale is increasingly available for a range of detection/diagnosis/theragnostic applications tailored to each patient's history and current condition. Prostatic adenocarcinoma (CAP) is the second most common malignancy among men with an estimated 220,000 new cases in the USA in 2008. With the advent of multi-parametric high resolution (3 Tesla (T)) prostate MRI, providing anatomic, biochemical, and physiologic information, it has become increasingly important to identify the potential value of this information in pre-operative or pre-therapeutic CAP screening. However, in vivo prostate MRI lacks the resolution and ground truth diagnostic accuracy histopathological examination of biopsy cores provides. A first step toward getting prostate MRI for CAP into the clinic would be validating the information provided from MR at the cellular level. However, validating MRI against histological ground truth currently lacks the means to link the information provided by radiological imaging and pathology seamlessly. This is primarily due to a lack of interoperability between informatics representations and tools. One missing element, for instance, is robust and accurate image registration tools to align the multi-modal volumetric data sets. The overarching goal of this collaborative project between the University of Pennsylvania, Rutgers University, and Siemens Corporate Research is to develop and evaluate multi-modal image analysis and machine learning techniques within a software framework that will enable efficient analysis, correlation, and interpretation of multi-functional, multi-resolution patient data. The availability of these multi-modal, multi- scale analysis tools will enable alignment of radiology and pathological data which in turn will (a) enable building and validation of supervised computerized decision support systems for detection and grading of CAP from radiology and pathology data and (b) building meta-classifiers for CAP by integrating multi- modal, multi-scale disease signatures. Such a set of prostate-specific informatics tools promises clinical benefits including improved patient prognoses, more accurate disease diagnoses, and therapeutic recommendations. More generally, the tools developed as part of this project will also enable radiologic/pathologic studies in other disease entities. The specific goals of this project are 1) to develop cross-platform, open source, grid-enabled annotation, image analysis and image registration tools that will enable cross modality validation of radiology data (multi-functional 3 T prostate MRI) with expert histopathological annotation of prostatectomy specimens and provide independent computer-aided predictions of cancer extent and grade on radiology and histopathology, 2) curate an open source caGRID- connected database of prostate MRI and histopathological specimens that will enable development of quantitative signatures for detection and grading of CAP across multiple scales and imaging modalities.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a software tool kit (based on the XIP application from Siemens corporation) that will allow scientists to study prostate cancer by combining data from multiple imaging modalities (radiology and pathology) with molecular methodologies (including proteins, genes, epigenetic data). The results of this fused and combined data sets will allow scientists to create a more robust system based view of prostate cancer which allow prediction of diagnosis, follow outcomes of therapeutic treatment and facilitate discovery of new treatment options            The goal of this project is to develop a software tool kit (based on the XIP application from Siemens corporation) that will allow scientists to study prostate cancer by combining data from multiple imaging modalities (radiology and pathology) with molecular methodologies (including proteins, genes, epigenetic data).

"Reliable Human-Model Observers for Emission Tomography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall objective is to develop numerical observers for dependable technology evaluations in emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) are the primary clinical modalities for imaging many types of cancer. However, early de- tection often presents the best chances of surviving cancer whereas these imaging modalities have limited diagnostic utility for small tumors. Systematic task-based developmental assessments could facilitate early identification of promising new technology for improving the diagnostic capabilities of these modalities. Yet, assessments with human observers are generally impractical for developmental use. Moreover, available mathematical models (or numerical observers) intended to predict human performance-what we refer to as human-model observers-present significant limits, including con- straints on the types of diagnostic tasks that can be considered. Partly because of these constraints, existing human-model observers frequently require revalidation given any change to the imaging pro- cess. Our approach to observer development is founded on the concept of task equivalence, whereby the task for the numerical observer mirrors the desired clinical task as closely as possible. In this grant, we propose a novel observer framework that is influenced by descriptions of radiologists' visual-search (VS) processes, in which an initial global scan of an image identifies candidate locations deserving closer inspection. We shall use the VS paradigm to investigate the hypotheses that task equivalence i) can lead to a human-observer model that reliably generalizes to a wide range of diagnostic tasks, and ii) is necessary to ensure truly relevant task-based evaluations. We shall test these hypotheses through observer studies with fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) whole-body PET and SPECT In-111 imaging of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). A state-of-the-art model observer for developmental stud- ies should be capable of detection-localization tasks, and our observer studies will be analyzed with jackknife FROC (JAFROC) methodology. The specific aims of this work are to: 1) determine what features of FDG-PET image slices attract initial human-observer attention; 2) develop a VS numerical observer for tumor detection-localization tasks in FDG-PET; 3) test the VS observer against humans in a JAFROC detection-localization study featuring hybrid PET images; 4) investigate generalizations of the VS observer to SPECT and 3D detection-localization tasks; and 5) compare system optimiza- tions for oncologic SPECT obtained from the VS and existing numerical observers. The application is optimization of a parallel-hole collimator design for In-111 NET imaging.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomog- raphy (SPECT) has a significant role in cancer diagnosis and management.

"Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers are heterogeneous in biology among patients, tumors in the same patient, and within tumors. As a result, they respond differently to therapy per patient, per tumor and within tumors. Different radiotracers and imaging modalities provide information about different aspects of biology and the physio-metabolic environments of the cancer. As a result, a single modality or radiotracer may not provide sufficient information to predict or assess response to therapy. We hypothesize that improved prediction and assessment of response can thus be obtained by combining quantitative image-derived parameters obtained from multiple imaging modalities or radiotracers. We propose to develop, optimize, and validate approaches for combining multiple image-derived parameters obtained from quantitative imaging procedures in order to optimally predict and assess treatment response. In particular, we propose to combine quantitative metrics from PET/CT, SPECT/CT, and MRI. We will first individually optimize the protocols, acquisition parameters, and imaging methods in order to get the most accurate and reliable parameters to combine. Optimally combining the parameters from different modalities requires knowledge of the reproducibility (precision) of the individual quantitative imaging parameters. We will thus use literature search, phantom studies, realistic simulations, and repeated patient studies to characterize the accuracy and precision of the individual quantitative imaging methods. We will then develop methods to combine the metrics to predict or assess treatment response per patient, per tumor and intra-tumor. We will apply and evaluate these methods in three clinical trials: dynamic and static FDG and FIT PET/CT to assess lung cancer response to cytotoxic chemotherapy; PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI in breast cancer response; and SPECT/CT, PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI to predict response of brain tumors to anti-angiogenic therapy. In these trials imaging parameters and their signatures will be linked to histology or survival outcomes to provide validation of the combined imaging parameter metrics.          n/a",Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy,8188738,U01CA140204,"['Albumins', 'Anatomy', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors', 'Animal Model', 'Biology', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cellularity', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cytotoxic Chemotherapy', 'Data', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methionine', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'PET/CT scan', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Systemic disease', 'Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate', 'Therapeutic', 'Tracer', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Volume', 'Validation', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'radiotracer', 'response', 'simulation', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'text searching', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2011,671728,0.013468348011283007
"Real-Time MRI Motion Correction System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MOTIVATION - Motion remains one of the most frequent contributors to image artifacts in MR studies.  The motion susceptibility of MRI is well-known and has spawned a number of elegant navigation techniques.  These methods, however, are tailored to specific MR acquisitions that require modified k-space trajectories or the acquisition of additional MR data, and most are unable to correct certain types of motion, for example, through-plane motion.  Moreover, motion correction has been focused on specific families of sequences, but no generally applicable approach currently exists.  Certain patient populations, such as pediatric or geriatric patients, are more likely to move than others.  In pediatric imaging, anesthesia is used to control motion, adding substantially to exam costs and patient risks.  A sequence-independent, autonomous and prospective motion correction system could greatly improve image quality for a wide spectrum of MR examinations.  For pediatric imaging, in particular, we anticipate reduced reliance on anesthesia to control patient motion.  AIMS - We will be focusing on three independent specific aims (carried out in parallel and completed within 4 years), with corresponding subaims that we believe are important for establishing the technical/scientific merit and to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed R&D efforts for our real-time adaptive motion correction approach.  Specifically, these aims are:  (1) to develop and evaluate a coil-mounted MR-compatible tracking device for routine clinical use; (2) to integrate pose tracking into real-time MRI; and (3) to validate our real-time motion correction system in volunteers and patients.  METHODS -In Aim 1 we will improve the methods for computer-vision-based pose estimation inside an MR scanner and build an MR-compatible coil-mounted pose tracker that can be used in clinical routine examinations.  In Aim 2 we will focus on reducing the latency between pose changes happening and the MR scanner reacting to these pose changes, and on building a software library for the MR pulse sequence development that allows one to implement real-time motion correction into all MR pulse sequences.  In Aim 3 we will perform a thorough evaluation of our system on 60 volunteers (30 adults and 30 children) and 120 patients (80 adults and 40 children).  SIGNIFICANCE - The impact of our technology has several facets.  First, it will improve patient care by reducing the number of MR images with compromised quality because of motion artifacts.  Especially because of the increasing reliance on MR Images as a primary means of diagnosis, this will reduce the number of misdiagnoses.  Secondly, this technology will help to lower the high national spending on imaging by dramatically improving the efficiency of MRI scanners.  Finally, it will improve patient comfort by reducing the need for repeat sequences, as well as reduce the necessity of sedation aimed at keeping the patient still.  Overall, this technology will have a significant impact on MRI both in clinical practice and basic science research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Synopsis Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.  This is not only of increasing concern due to the aging population and its associated diseases, but also in children and patients who are simply too sick to remain still during an exam.  This proposal aims to build an optical tracking system and methods to adapt MRI pulse sequences to changes in patient pose in real time.  The project leverages on previous work from an R21 project in which a prototype system was successfully built.  Specifically, the aims are to (i) introduce innovative improvements to the existing prototype, making the system suitable for use in clinical routine, (ii) modify the optical tracking system to be compatible with multiple MR sequences, and (iii) perform clinical evaluation.  Our real-time technique is a unique and innovative solution that will improve MRI image quality and thus patient care, and will address the escalating burden of imaging costs on the health care system.              Synopsis  Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.

Our real-time technique is a unique and innovative solution that will improve MRI image quality and thus patient care, and will address the escalating burden of imaging costs on the health care system.",Real-Time MRI Motion Correction System,8141396,R01EB011654,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Callback', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Safety', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Electronics', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reliance', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Sedation procedure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Solutions', 'Speed', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Well in self', 'Work', 'aging population', 'analog', 'base', 'body system', 'clinical practice', 'comparative', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'design', 'detector', 'digital', 'human subject', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lens', 'meetings', 'novel marker', 'optical imaging', 'patient population', 'peer', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'tool', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,540015,0.06474453358080595
"Prostate-cancer Imaging by Combined Ultrasound and Magnetic-resonance Parameters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance to detect PCa; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project is highly significant because it addresses a major health problem in the United States and other developed countries. The project will overcome the current inability of established clinical-imaging method to image PCa reliably by combining the capabilities of advanced ultrasound (US) and magnetic-resonance (MR) techniques in a clinically effective manner. The proposed approach will exploit the sensitivity of US to mechanical properties of tissue on a microscopic scale with the sensitivity of MR to chemical constituents of tissue and its ability to sense blood distribution. Each of these modalities senses different and independent properties of tissue and has shown encouraging potential for improved imaging of PCa when used alone; combining parameters derived from each modality can provide far superior sensitivity and specificity for PCa. We will combine US and MR parameters using advanced classifiers such as artificial neural networks and support-vector machines. These classifiers already have produced ROC-curve areas of 0.91 for advanced US methods, and the MR methods have demonstrated equivalent ROC-curve areas in many studies. We will embody the combined capabilities in specifications for a prototype imaging system that can generate prostate tissue-typing images (TTIs) in real-time for targeting biopsies or planning treatment in the operating room or in an off-line setting. The latest Logiq E9 instrument currently being produced by GE already has a capability for fusing previously obtained MR images with US images in real time, which provides an existing framework for combining US and MR parameters and generating real-time TTIs. Successfully generating reliable prostate TTIs based on combined US and MR parameters will represent a quantum advance in PCa management by enabling significant improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of PCa.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy.

"Noninvasive imaging-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to establish a strategy that will make neuronal electrical signaling detectable via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a whole-brain level. Our approach is built on the novel concept of using cell-adhesive micron-scale electronic devices to transduce neuronal potentials across the brain into magnetic field fluctuations. As part of our validation of these voltage-sensing microprobes, we also propose to implement a new, scalable method for simultaneous recording of MRI and electrophysiological data. The methods we propose to develop will be broadly applicable to problems in neurobiology, and will transform neuroscientists' ability to study integrative functions of the brain. Our microprobe approach will also help establish a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine and molecular imaging, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology. Recent work has dem- onstrated that micron-scale electrodes, coated with cell-adhesive molecules and juxtaposed against cultured cells allow recording of millivolt-scale action potentials, comparable to intracellular recordings. The current induced in a microelectrode can be converted into a modest, transient magnetic field if it is channeled into an inductor. In Specific Aim 1, we will model the magnetic fields produced by feasible currents in spiral or solenoidal microcoils of defined geometry, compute predicted effects on MRI signal amplitude and phase as a function of microprobe distribution, and fabricate the microprobes themselves. Preliminary calculations indicate that localized, transient fields of about 10 nT could be produced in individual 10-turn microcoils of 1 5m diameter. Magnetic fields of this order are greater than endogenous neuronal fields detected in tech- nologies like magnetoencephalography, and have been shown previously to be measurable by MRI in some contexts. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the ability of our microprobes to report action potentials from neu- ronal populations in MRI. The microdevices wil first be applied to cultured neurons or neural tissue slices and placed in an MRI scanner. Data series will be obtained using multiple protocols to detect variations of MRI signal due to variations in neuronal activity. If experiments in culture are successful, microprobes will be site-specifically injected into the cerebral cortex of anesthetized rats, and tested in an somatosensory stimu- lation paradigm. In Specific Aim 3, we will establish a simultaneous MRI and conventional electrophysiology approach to validate the novel MRI voltage probes directly. Performing electrophysiology in an MRI scanner is complicated by artifacts induced by the scanning hardware, in particular due to switched gradient fields. To circumvent this problem, we will measure neuronal potentials using differential recording from pairs of channels on tetrodes or modified tetrodes. Once the in-scanner recording method has been refined, MRI- based and conventional electrophysiology data will be obtained and compared to assess performance of the voltage-sensing microprobes, and to guide further improvements, if necessary.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Noninvasive MRI-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices will have high impact in biology, and specifically in brain research, both through applications to the study of neurological disease and as tools for the analysis of neural network function in basic neuroscience. The microprobes we propose to develop represent a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology.            Noninvasive MRI-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices will have high impact in biology, and specifically in brain research, both through applications to the study of neurological disease and as tools for the analysis of neural network function in basic neuroscience.

"Robust BCT for Clinical Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a major public health threat for over 50% of the population over age 50. Despite its importance, osteoporosis is largely under-treated, with less than 20% of those recommended for testing being screened. With substantial reimbursement cuts being introduced by Medicare for bone densitometry by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, the current clinical standard), with a sensitivity of DXA for fracture prediction of less than 50%, and with the rapidly increasing size of the aging population of the U.S., there is an urgent need for additional and more sensitive modalities than DXA for clinical assessment of fracture risk. Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT) has emerged as a powerful alternative to DXA. This CT-based technology creates a structural ""finite element"" model of a patient's bone from their CT scans, and subjects that model to virtual forces in order to provide an estimate of the strength of the bone. Well validated in cadaver studies and being a better predictor of bone strength than is bone mineral density by DXA, BCT has also been shown to be highly predictive of osteoporotic fractures in clinical research studies. However, robustness remains an issue - can the technique be used easily by non-experts in research and clinical environments? Addressing this issue, the overall goal of this research is to improve the robustness of our software, such that it can automatically analyze scans from a wide range of CT scanners and using a wide variety of CT acquisition protocols, including new low-dose protocols that limit radiation exposure to the patient. Such a robust BCT diagnostic tool could then be offered as a supplementary ""add-on"" analysis to many types of CT exams taken for other purposes such as CT colonography, pelvic, abdominal, and spine exams, thus reducing hospital costs, incurring no addition radiation to the patient, requiring no change in the CT acquisition protocols, and therefore greatly increasing the number of patients that could be screened at low cost. Specifically, we propose in this Phase-I project to combine expertise in computer vision, CT scanning, and biomechanics in order to develop an automated method of ""phantomless"" cross-calibration of CT scans for robust vertebral strength assessment. Focusing on the spine, our major tasks are to perform a series of clinical studies in which patients are scanned twice using a variety of CT acquisition protocols; develop a custom external-calibration phantom and use that to determine the effects of various CT acquisition parameters on scanning standardization; and use machine learning techniques to develop a ""statistical atlas"" of the spine for automation of all image processing. We will combine these efforts to develop a phantomless BCT method that accounts for differences in image quality due to variations in CT scanners and acquisition protocols, including low-dose protocols, and that does so in a highly automated fashion requiring minimal user expertise and input. Should this project be successful, future work will further refine the techniques, extend them to the hip and quantitative analysis of muscle and other soft tissues, and address robustness of longitudinal changes for clinical monitoring.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With a mortality rate up to 30% one year after hip fracture, and an economic burden exceeding $17 billion annually, osteoporotic fracture is a debilitating condition whose impact on our aging society is growing. Early identification of those at risk for fracture can guide prevention and treatment, and BCT will provide a means for such detection with a sensitivity and specificity lacking in DXA based bone densitometry. The greater radiation exposure from CT, however, limits the market for such a diagnostic. The proposed project will result in a robust diagnostic test that significantly lowers radiation dose to the patient, and in some implementations, completely eliminates additional radiation by using CT scans already ordered for other medical purposes. Successful development of this product will broaden the pool of individuals who will benefit from a more accurate and sensitive fracture risk prediction, expand the market for O. N. Diagnostics' business, and result in an important advance in the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.           Statement of Relevance With a mortality rate up to 30% one year after hip fracture, and an economic burden exceeding $17 billion annually, osteoporotic fracture is a debilitating condition whose impact on our aging society is growing.

"High-Throughput Computing for a Multi-Plan Framework in Radiotherapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Computerized planning for radiation delivery via either external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or intensity- modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) from linear accelerators is a complex process involving a large amount of input data and vast numbers of decision variables. Such large-scale combinatorial optimization problems are typically intractable for conventional approaches such as the direct application of the best available commercial algorithms, and thus specialized methods that take advantage of problem structure are required. Radiation treatment planning (RTP) problems are further complicated by the fact that they are multi-objective, that is, the RTP optimization process must take into account a trade-off between the competing goals of delivering appropriate doses to the tumor and avoiding the delivery of harmful radiation to nearby healthy organs. The goal of this proposal is to harness distributive computing via the Condor system for High Throughput Computing (HTC) within an RTP environment. The specific aims for this proposal are: 1) To develop a Nested Partitions (NP) framework that guides a global search process for optimal IMRT delivery parameters using HTC. 2) To develop parallel HTC-based linear programming (LP) methods to efficiently solve the dose optimization problem in IMRT for each given set of beam angles or beam apertures. (3) To exploit a high-throughput computing (HTC) environment and the developed NP/LP/segmentation framework to efficiently generate multiple plans for each given patient case. (4) To couple this multi-plan framework with a decision support system (DSS) that includes planning surface models, a graphical-user-interface (GUI) and machine learning tools to prediction OAR complication in order to aid in the ranking and selection of the generated treatment plans. This proposal requires a multi-disciplinary approach that is best conducted within the framework of the Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology program announcement. It brings together an interdisciplinary team of investigators with expertise in medical physics, mathematical programming, industrial engineering and clinical radiation oncology that is crucial to the development of the proposed multi- plan framework using HTC in radiation therapy.

It will develop novel algorithms that will enable generation of superior treatment plans with the added advantage of increasing the speed of treatment planning. Further, it will allow physicians to know beforehand the quality of the treatment plan relative to the multiple treatment objectives and be able to determine the treatment complication scenario beforehand.           PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to develop a multi-dimensional platform for sophisticated treatment planning of radiation delivery.

"Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization for Rapid IMRT and VMAT Treatment Planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has revolutionized the treatment of cancers in the last decade, since it can tightly conform and escalate radiation dose to a tumor while simultaneously protecting nearby radiation- sensitive normal tissues, resulting in better local control and fewer post-treatment complications than previous techniques. However, the process of obtaining a clinically acceptable IMRT plan for a difficult site is still extremely slow, requiring many hours of a busy expert's time in a manual trial-and-error loop of parameter adjustment. The goal of this project is to drastically reduce the amount of time to obtain a clinically acceptable IMRT plan using a new automated method that directly applies constrained optimization in a computationally tractable and clinically meaningful way. The hypothesis is that clinical treatment planning times using this technique will be reduced from several hours to a matter of minutes.  The new approach, called ROCO (Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization) translates well-established concepts from optimization and machine learning theory to the novel application of IMRT planning, exploiting the speed and ease of unconstrained optimizations and introducing a dimensionality reduction step that makes true constrained optimization tractable. The Specific Aims of the proposal are to (1) apply Reduced-Order Con- strained Optimization to IMRT planning for non-small cell lung cancers and nasopharynx cancers, where the planning process is highly time-consuming; (2) develop and extend the Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization paradigm to a promising IMRT variant called Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) for the prostate site, which is currently nearly clinically intractable to plan; and (3) integrate the new tools into the clinical IMRT planning process at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, using a powered study to verify the hypothesis that the proposed method significantly improves planning speed. The experiments will be designed in consultation with an expert clinical treatment planner and biostatistician, and carefully validated using anonymized data from approximately 50 patients for each site.  The main benefit of the proposed approach is to drastically reduce planning times, which is critical if IMRT and VMAT are to reach their full potential in clinical application. In a busy clinic, long planning times place a severe stress on available resources, and can result in treatment delays, acceptance of sub-optimal plans or - in the worst case - errors due to time pressure. In the longer term, the proposed approach will provide deeper insight into the critical elements of the dose optimization problem, significantly reduce the trial-and-error effort characteristic of current IMRT planning, and reduce subjectivity in treatment plan selection.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an extremely promising cancer treatment, but currently requires many hours of an expert treatment planner's time to obtain a plan that meets all the clinical constraints specified by the physician. This proposal describes a new, automatic method for treatment plan optimization that is very fast, requiring only minutes to produce a plan that directly meets all the physician's constraints, potentially saving much time for a busy clinic.           Project Narrative Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an extremely promising cancer treatment, but currently requires many hours of an expert treatment planner's time to obtain a plan that meets all the clinical constraints specified by the physician.

"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase. Dementia has many possible underlying causes and several different causes are at work in most elderly demented subjects. In this grant, we will use modern brain imaging to identify specific mechanisms underlying progression to dementia. n/a",Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging,7894558,R01AG011378,"['6-hydroxybenzothiazole', 'Abbreviations', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease Pathway', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Amyloidosis', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Applications Grants', 'Attenuated', 'Autopsy', 'Base of the Brain', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Correlation Studies', 'Critiques', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inositol', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'N-acetylaspartate', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pittsburgh Compound-B', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scheme', 'Senile Plaques', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Spin Labels', 'Staging', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Syndrome', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'amyloid imaging', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'molecular imaging', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'population based', 'primary outcome', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NIA,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2010,1034999,-0.007621022209538727
"Software to facilitate multimode, multiscale fused data for Pathology and Radiolo    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical informatics from the macro- to micro-scale is increasingly available for a range of detection/diagnosis/theragnostic applications tailored to each patient's history and current condition. Prostatic adenocarcinoma (CAP) is the second most common malignancy among men with an estimated 220,000 new cases in the USA in 2008. With the advent of multi-parametric high resolution (3 Tesla (T)) prostate MRI, providing anatomic, biochemical, and physiologic information, it has become increasingly important to identify the potential value of this information in pre-operative or pre-therapeutic CAP screening. However, in vivo prostate MRI lacks the resolution and ground truth diagnostic accuracy histopathological examination of biopsy cores provides. A first step toward getting prostate MRI for CAP into the clinic would be validating the information provided from MR at the cellular level. However, validating MRI against histological ground truth currently lacks the means to link the information provided by radiological imaging and pathology seamlessly. This is primarily due to a lack of interoperability between informatics representations and tools. One missing element, for instance, is robust and accurate image registration tools to align the multi-modal volumetric data sets. The overarching goal of this collaborative project between the University of Pennsylvania, Rutgers University, and Siemens Corporate Research is to develop and evaluate multi-modal image analysis and machine learning techniques within a software framework that will enable efficient analysis, correlation, and interpretation of multi-functional, multi-resolution patient data. The availability of these multi-modal, multi- scale analysis tools will enable alignment of radiology and pathological data which in turn will (a) enable building and validation of supervised computerized decision support systems for detection and grading of CAP from radiology and pathology data and (b) building meta-classifiers for CAP by integrating multi- modal, multi-scale disease signatures. Such a set of prostate-specific informatics tools promises clinical benefits including improved patient prognoses, more accurate disease diagnoses, and therapeutic recommendations. More generally, the tools developed as part of this project will also enable radiologic/pathologic studies in other disease entities. The specific goals of this project are 1) to develop cross-platform, open source, grid-enabled annotation, image analysis and image registration tools that will enable cross modality validation of radiology data (multi-functional 3 T prostate MRI) with expert histopathological annotation of prostatectomy specimens and provide independent computer-aided predictions of cancer extent and grade on radiology and histopathology, 2) curate an open source caGRID- connected database of prostate MRI and histopathological specimens that will enable development of quantitative signatures for detection and grading of CAP across multiple scales and imaging modalities.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a software tool kit (based on the XIP application from Siemens corporation) that will allow scientists to study prostate cancer by combining data from multiple imaging modalities (radiology and pathology) with molecular methodologies (including proteins, genes, epigenetic data). The results of this fused and combined data sets will allow scientists to create a more robust system based view of prostate cancer which allow prediction of diagnosis, follow outcomes of therapeutic treatment and facilitate discovery of new treatment options            The goal of this project is to develop a software tool kit (based on the XIP application from Siemens corporation) that will allow scientists to study prostate cancer by combining data from multiple imaging modalities (radiology and pathology) with molecular methodologies (including proteins, genes, epigenetic data).

"Reliable Human-Model Observers for Emission Tomography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall objective is to develop numerical observers for dependable technology evaluations in emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) are the primary clinical modalities for imaging many types of cancer. However, early de- tection often presents the best chances of surviving cancer whereas these imaging modalities have limited diagnostic utility for small tumors. Systematic task-based developmental assessments could facilitate early identification of promising new technology for improving the diagnostic capabilities of these modalities. Yet, assessments with human observers are generally impractical for developmental use. Moreover, available mathematical models (or numerical observers) intended to predict human performance-what we refer to as human-model observers-present significant limits, including con- straints on the types of diagnostic tasks that can be considered. Partly because of these constraints, existing human-model observers frequently require revalidation given any change to the imaging pro- cess. Our approach to observer development is founded on the concept of task equivalence, whereby the task for the numerical observer mirrors the desired clinical task as closely as possible. In this grant, we propose a novel observer framework that is influenced by descriptions of radiologists' visual-search (VS) processes, in which an initial global scan of an image identifies candidate locations deserving closer inspection. We shall use the VS paradigm to investigate the hypotheses that task equivalence i) can lead to a human-observer model that reliably generalizes to a wide range of diagnostic tasks, and ii) is necessary to ensure truly relevant task-based evaluations. We shall test these hypotheses through observer studies with fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) whole-body PET and SPECT In-111 imaging of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). A state-of-the-art model observer for developmental stud- ies should be capable of detection-localization tasks, and our observer studies will be analyzed with jackknife FROC (JAFROC) methodology. The specific aims of this work are to: 1) determine what features of FDG-PET image slices attract initial human-observer attention; 2) develop a VS numerical observer for tumor detection-localization tasks in FDG-PET; 3) test the VS observer against humans in a JAFROC detection-localization study featuring hybrid PET images; 4) investigate generalizations of the VS observer to SPECT and 3D detection-localization tasks; and 5) compare system optimiza- tions for oncologic SPECT obtained from the VS and existing numerical observers. The application is optimization of a parallel-hole collimator design for In-111 NET imaging.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomog- raphy (SPECT) has a significant role in cancer diagnosis and management.

"High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Understanding normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and neonates is a key factor in early detection of developmental disorders. This project proposal seeks to develop and refine novel magnetic resonance image reconstruction and analysis methodology to allow, for the first time, the mapping of in-utero fetal brain development. One of the most common abnormalities detected by clinical imaging of the developing fetal brain is ventriculomegaly, which, despite the absence of other clinical or imaging findings, is associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities in infancy and childhood in up to 50% of cases. Although ultrasound allows diagnosis of the condition, it has not been able to distinguish those fetus that will have poor neurological outcome from those with normal outcome. Recent developments in fast magnetic resonance imaging have permitted the use of MRI to study the fetal anatomy and this technique is now being routinely used at a small number of sites around the world including UCSF. However, MR imaging of the fetal brain is still challenging because of imaging distortions caused by motion of the fetus within the mother and by artifacts caused by the surrounding maternal anatomy. Higher resolution or 3D acquisitions are not possible because of motion of the fetus during the acquisition time^ required. The current clinical 2D slice data individually provide limited resolution and contrast and, most importantly, often contain severe motion corruption between slices. This project is motivated by the observation that it is possible to apply computer vision and image processing techniques to correct relative motion between the multiple stacks of low resolution fetal slices, and create a single volumetric image with high isotropic 3D resolution and consistent geometry. Such higher resolution images provide structure that may be analyzed using computational morphometric techniques that can detect subtle focal differences in the pattern of tissue volume, location and surface folding. This project will combine such powerful techniques with extensive fetal and neonatal imaging experience at UCSF, allowing direct clinical application of the methodology to study morphologic aberrations associated with ventriculomegaly and to correlate these with clinical outcome. The ability to apply these computational techniques to in-utero data will provide an entirely new view of the developing brain, which promises to shed new light on early developmental problems both in fetuses and premature neonates.           n/a",High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI,7904306,R01NS055064,"['Anatomy', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evolution', 'Fetus', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurological outcome', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Premature Infant', 'Prematurity of fetus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'insight', 'neonate', 'novel', 'premature', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2010,48929,0.020222306068820084
"Real-Time MRI Motion Correction System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MOTIVATION - Motion remains one of the most frequent contributors to image artifacts in MR studies.  The motion susceptibility of MRI is well-known and has spawned a number of elegant navigation techniques.  These methods, however, are tailored to specific MR acquisitions that require modified k-space trajectories or the acquisition of additional MR data, and most are unable to correct certain types of motion, for example, through-plane motion.  Moreover, motion correction has been focused on specific families of sequences, but no generally applicable approach currently exists.  Certain patient populations, such as pediatric or geriatric patients, are more likely to move than others.  In pediatric imaging, anesthesia is used to control motion, adding substantially to exam costs and patient risks.  A sequence-independent, autonomous and prospective motion correction system could greatly improve image quality for a wide spectrum of MR examinations.  For pediatric imaging, in particular, we anticipate reduced reliance on anesthesia to control patient motion.  AIMS - We will be focusing on three independent specific aims (carried out in parallel and completed within 4 years), with corresponding subaims that we believe are important for establishing the technical/scientific merit and to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed R&D efforts for our real-time adaptive motion correction approach.  Specifically, these aims are:  (1) to develop and evaluate a coil-mounted MR-compatible tracking device for routine clinical use; (2) to integrate pose tracking into real-time MRI; and (3) to validate our real-time motion correction system in volunteers and patients.  METHODS -In Aim 1 we will improve the methods for computer-vision-based pose estimation inside an MR scanner and build an MR-compatible coil-mounted pose tracker that can be used in clinical routine examinations.  In Aim 2 we will focus on reducing the latency between pose changes happening and the MR scanner reacting to these pose changes, and on building a software library for the MR pulse sequence development that allows one to implement real-time motion correction into all MR pulse sequences.  In Aim 3 we will perform a thorough evaluation of our system on 60 volunteers (30 adults and 30 children) and 120 patients (80 adults and 40 children).  SIGNIFICANCE - The impact of our technology has several facets.  First, it will improve patient care by reducing the number of MR images with compromised quality because of motion artifacts.  Especially because of the increasing reliance on MR Images as a primary means of diagnosis, this will reduce the number of misdiagnoses.  Secondly, this technology will help to lower the high national spending on imaging by dramatically improving the efficiency of MRI scanners.  Finally, it will improve patient comfort by reducing the need for repeat sequences, as well as reduce the necessity of sedation aimed at keeping the patient still.  Overall, this technology will have a significant impact on MRI both in clinical practice and basic science research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Synopsis Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.  This is not only of increasing concern due to the aging population and its associated diseases, but also in children and patients who are simply too sick to remain still during an exam.  This proposal aims to build an optical tracking system and methods to adapt MRI pulse sequences to changes in patient pose in real time.  The project leverages on previous work from an R21 project in which a prototype system was successfully built.  Specifically, the aims are to (i) introduce innovative improvements to the existing prototype, making the system suitable for use in clinical routine, (ii) modify the optical tracking system to be compatible with multiple MR sequences, and (iii) perform clinical evaluation.  Our real-time technique is a unique and innovative solution that will improve MRI image quality and thus patient care, and will address the escalating burden of imaging costs on the health care system.              Synopsis  Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.

"Prostate-cancer Imaging by Combined Ultrasound and Magnetic-resonance Parameters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance to detect PCa; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project is highly significant because it addresses a major health problem in the United States and other developed countries. The project will overcome the current inability of established clinical-imaging method to image PCa reliably by combining the capabilities of advanced ultrasound (US) and magnetic-resonance (MR) techniques in a clinically effective manner. The proposed approach will exploit the sensitivity of US to mechanical properties of tissue on a microscopic scale with the sensitivity of MR to chemical constituents of tissue and its ability to sense blood distribution. Each of these modalities senses different and independent properties of tissue and has shown encouraging potential for improved imaging of PCa when used alone; combining parameters derived from each modality can provide far superior sensitivity and specificity for PCa. We will combine US and MR parameters using advanced classifiers such as artificial neural networks and support-vector machines. These classifiers already have produced ROC-curve areas of 0.91 for advanced US methods, and the MR methods have demonstrated equivalent ROC-curve areas in many studies. We will embody the combined capabilities in specifications for a prototype imaging system that can generate prostate tissue-typing images (TTIs) in real-time for targeting biopsies or planning treatment in the operating room or in an off-line setting. The latest Logiq E9 instrument currently being produced by GE already has a capability for fusing previously obtained MR images with US images in real time, which provides an existing framework for combining US and MR parameters and generating real-time TTIs. Successfully generating reliable prostate TTIs based on combined US and MR parameters will represent a quantum advance in PCa management by enabling significant improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of PCa.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy.

"Robust BCT for Clinical Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a major public health threat for over 50% of the population over age 50. Despite its importance, osteoporosis is largely under-treated, with less than 20% of those recommended for testing being screened. With substantial reimbursement cuts being introduced by Medicare for bone densitometry by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, the current clinical standard), with a sensitivity of DXA for fracture prediction of less than 50%, and with the rapidly increasing size of the aging population of the U.S., there is an urgent need for additional and more sensitive modalities than DXA for clinical assessment of fracture risk. Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT) has emerged as a powerful alternative to DXA. This CT-based technology creates a structural ""finite element"" model of a patient's bone from their CT scans, and subjects that model to virtual forces in order to provide an estimate of the strength of the bone. Well validated in cadaver studies and being a better predictor of bone strength than is bone mineral density by DXA, BCT has also been shown to be highly predictive of osteoporotic fractures in clinical research studies. However, robustness remains an issue - can the technique be used easily by non-experts in research and clinical environments? Addressing this issue, the overall goal of this research is to improve the robustness of our software, such that it can automatically analyze scans from a wide range of CT scanners and using a wide variety of CT acquisition protocols, including new low-dose protocols that limit radiation exposure to the patient. Such a robust BCT diagnostic tool could then be offered as a supplementary ""add-on"" analysis to many types of CT exams taken for other purposes such as CT colonography, pelvic, abdominal, and spine exams, thus reducing hospital costs, incurring no addition radiation to the patient, requiring no change in the CT acquisition protocols, and therefore greatly increasing the number of patients that could be screened at low cost. Specifically, we propose in this Phase-I project to combine expertise in computer vision, CT scanning, and biomechanics in order to develop an automated method of ""phantomless"" cross-calibration of CT scans for robust vertebral strength assessment. Focusing on the spine, our major tasks are to perform a series of clinical studies in which patients are scanned twice using a variety of CT acquisition protocols; develop a custom external-calibration phantom and use that to determine the effects of various CT acquisition parameters on scanning standardization; and use machine learning techniques to develop a ""statistical atlas"" of the spine for automation of all image processing. We will combine these efforts to develop a phantomless BCT method that accounts for differences in image quality due to variations in CT scanners and acquisition protocols, including low-dose protocols, and that does so in a highly automated fashion requiring minimal user expertise and input. Should this project be successful, future work will further refine the techniques, extend them to the hip and quantitative analysis of muscle and other soft tissues, and address robustness of longitudinal changes for clinical monitoring.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With a mortality rate up to 30% one year after hip fracture, and an economic burden exceeding $17 billion annually, osteoporotic fracture is a debilitating condition whose impact on our aging society is growing. Early identification of those at risk for fracture can guide prevention and treatment, and BCT will provide a means for such detection with a sensitivity and specificity lacking in DXA based bone densitometry. The greater radiation exposure from CT, however, limits the market for such a diagnostic. The proposed project will result in a robust diagnostic test that significantly lowers radiation dose to the patient, and in some implementations, completely eliminates additional radiation by using CT scans already ordered for other medical purposes. Successful development of this product will broaden the pool of individuals who will benefit from a more accurate and sensitive fracture risk prediction, expand the market for O. N. Diagnostics' business, and result in an important advance in the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.           Statement of Relevance With a mortality rate up to 30% one year after hip fracture, and an economic burden exceeding $17 billion annually, osteoporotic fracture is a debilitating condition whose impact on our aging society is growing.

"High-Throughput Computing for a Multi-Plan Framework in Radiotherapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Computerized planning for radiation delivery via either external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or intensity- modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) from linear accelerators is a complex process involving a large amount of input data and vast numbers of decision variables. Such large-scale combinatorial optimization problems are typically intractable for conventional approaches such as the direct application of the best available commercial algorithms, and thus specialized methods that take advantage of problem structure are required. Radiation treatment planning (RTP) problems are further complicated by the fact that they are multi-objective, that is, the RTP optimization process must take into account a trade-off between the competing goals of delivering appropriate doses to the tumor and avoiding the delivery of harmful radiation to nearby healthy organs. The goal of this proposal is to harness distributive computing via the Condor system for High Throughput Computing (HTC) within an RTP environment. The specific aims for this proposal are: 1) To develop a Nested Partitions (NP) framework that guides a global search process for optimal IMRT delivery parameters using HTC. 2) To develop parallel HTC-based linear programming (LP) methods to efficiently solve the dose optimization problem in IMRT for each given set of beam angles or beam apertures. (3) To exploit a high-throughput computing (HTC) environment and the developed NP/LP/segmentation framework to efficiently generate multiple plans for each given patient case. (4) To couple this multi-plan framework with a decision support system (DSS) that includes planning surface models, a graphical-user-interface (GUI) and machine learning tools to prediction OAR complication in order to aid in the ranking and selection of the generated treatment plans. This proposal requires a multi-disciplinary approach that is best conducted within the framework of the Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology program announcement. It brings together an interdisciplinary team of investigators with expertise in medical physics, mathematical programming, industrial engineering and clinical radiation oncology that is crucial to the development of the proposed multi- plan framework using HTC in radiation therapy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to develop a multi-dimensional platform for sophisticated treatment planning of radiation delivery. It will develop novel algorithms that will enable generation of superior treatment plans with the added advantage of increasing the speed of treatment planning. Further, it will allow physicians to know beforehand the quality of the treatment plan relative to the multiple treatment objectives and be able to determine the treatment complication scenario beforehand.           PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to develop a multi-dimensional platform for sophisticated treatment planning of radiation delivery.

"AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 1 million people in the US will experience a heart attack or sudden cardiac death. A large percentage of these patients have no prior symptoms of any kind but suffer from silent heart disease (ischemia), which may cause a heart attack at any time. Currently there is no reliable screening method to identify people who may have silent heart disease and therefore are at risk of ""heart attack"".       We seek to extract additional data from a non-invasive Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the heart (commonly used in most imaging centers), which will better identify patients who are ""vulnerable"" to sudden heart attack. These images are acquired without contrast agents, as a common screening test for measuring coronary calcium, another clinical marker of coronary artery disease. We will prove that additional information about cardiovascular risk can be obtained by quantifying pericardial fat surrounding the heart in these cardiac CT images. Although this information exists in the cardiac CT scans acquired today, it is ignored in clinical practice because currently there are no tools to measure it automatically and reliably, and no information regarding its significance for a given patient.       We will develop fully automated, accurate, new computer software for quantitation of pericardial fat from cardiac CT images acquired for routine assessment of coronary calcium. We plan to achieve complete automation and accuracy, by applying a combination of robust and effective algorithms in machine learning with anatomical knowledge. We aim to prove that the developed automatic software will be as accurate, and more reproducible than experienced imaging physicians in quantifying pericardial fat, and will accomplish the measurement in a fraction of the time. Such software could be immediately made available worldwide to standard imaging workstations. For the first time, this will allow its use as a standard practical imaging tool for cardiovascular risk assessment, without requiring additional time, imaging or radiation risk to the patient.       We will also show that this new quantitative information has important additional value compared to other clinical cardiovascular risk factors and information from blood samples (such as cholesterol, glucose and CRP), and the amount of calcium in the patient's coronary arteries seen on CT scans, and establish its significance in the prediction of silent heart disease.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This new research will allow accurate prediction of who might be more likely to have heart disease which may ultimately cause a heart attack. It will allow doctors to identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed to avoid a heart attack, or more extensive testing, could be recommended, to confirm or rule out heart disease.          n/a",AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR,7588839,R21EB006829,"['Abdomen', 'Algorithms', 'Automation', 'Biochemical', 'Blood specimen', 'C-reactive protein', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patients', 'Pericardial body location', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Radiation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visceral', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'indexing', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool', 'waist circumference']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2009,196375,0.03515782735380783
"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase.

"Software to facilitate multimode, multiscale fused data for Pathology and Radiolo    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical informatics from the macro- to micro-scale is increasingly available for a range of detection/diagnosis/theragnostic applications tailored to each patient's history and current condition. Prostatic adenocarcinoma (CAP) is the second most common malignancy among men with an estimated 220,000 new cases in the USA in 2008. With the advent of multi-parametric high resolution (3 Tesla (T)) prostate MRI, providing anatomic, biochemical, and physiologic information, it has become increasingly important to identify the potential value of this information in pre-operative or pre-therapeutic CAP screening. However, in vivo prostate MRI lacks the resolution and ground truth diagnostic accuracy histopathological examination of biopsy cores provides. A first step toward getting prostate MRI for CAP into the clinic would be validating the information provided from MR at the cellular level. However, validating MRI against histological ground truth currently lacks the means to link the information provided by radiological imaging and pathology seamlessly. This is primarily due to a lack of interoperability between informatics representations and tools. One missing element, for instance, is robust and accurate image registration tools to align the multi-modal volumetric data sets. The overarching goal of this collaborative project between the University of Pennsylvania, Rutgers University, and Siemens Corporate Research is to develop and evaluate multi-modal image analysis and machine learning techniques within a software framework that will enable efficient analysis, correlation, and interpretation of multi-functional, multi-resolution patient data. The availability of these multi-modal, multi- scale analysis tools will enable alignment of radiology and pathological data which in turn will (a) enable building and validation of supervised computerized decision support systems for detection and grading of CAP from radiology and pathology data and (b) building meta-classifiers for CAP by integrating multi- modal, multi-scale disease signatures. Such a set of prostate-specific informatics tools promises clinical benefits including improved patient prognoses, more accurate disease diagnoses, and therapeutic recommendations. More generally, the tools developed as part of this project will also enable radiologic/pathologic studies in other disease entities. The specific goals of this project are 1) to develop cross-platform, open source, grid-enabled annotation, image analysis and image registration tools that will enable cross modality validation of radiology data (multi-functional 3 T prostate MRI) with expert histopathological annotation of prostatectomy specimens and provide independent computer-aided predictions of cancer extent and grade on radiology and histopathology, 2) curate an open source caGRID- connected database of prostate MRI and histopathological specimens that will enable development of quantitative signatures for detection and grading of CAP across multiple scales and imaging modalities.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a software tool kit (based on the XIP application from Siemens corporation) that will allow scientists to study prostate cancer by combining data from multiple imaging modalities (radiology and pathology) with molecular methodologies (including proteins, genes, epigenetic data). The results of this fused and combined data sets will allow scientists to create a more robust system based view of prostate cancer which allow prediction of diagnosis, follow outcomes of therapeutic treatment and facilitate discovery of new treatment options            The goal of this project is to develop a software tool kit (based on the XIP application from Siemens corporation) that will allow scientists to study prostate cancer by combining data from multiple imaging modalities (radiology and pathology) with molecular methodologies (including proteins, genes, epigenetic data).

"Detecting Prostate Cancer using multi-protocol 3 Tesla in vivo MRI and MRS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PI: Madabhushi, Anant Early detection of prostatic adenocarcinoma (CAP) offers the best hope of curing it. Currently, the only way to definitively diagnose CAP is through histological analysis of excised tissue, obtained via blind sextant trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS)-directed biopsies. However, the accuracy of TRUS biopsies is only 20-25% for elevated PSA levels. Recently, high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) has been shown to be superior to ultrasound in visualizing prostatic structures. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) refers to the use of computer programs in assisting radiologists detect abnormalities from radiological images. The aim of this project is to develop a CAD system to detect prostate cancer from multi-protocol 3 Tesla in vivo MRI and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic (MRS) Imaging (MRSI). The initial higher costs associated with MRI will be offset by a reduction in unnecessary biopsies and an increase in the number of cancers detected via biopsy. The long term goals of this work are to motivate use of CAD with high resolution MRI/MRSI:- 1. For early detection of CAP in moderate to high risk patients and thereby reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies and radical prostatectomies. 2. Improving cancer detection rates by replacing TRUS with CAD-assisted MRI guided prostate biopsies. 3. For improved target dose conformality in prostate therapy. 4. For assessing quantitative response to anti-cancer therapy. The proposed work comprises a total of 3 specific aims and 10 tasks. A total of 40 anonymised patient data sets comprising multi-protocol 3 Tesla (T) in vivo MRI/MRSI scans before and multi-protocol 3 T ex vivo MRI/MRSI scans with accompanying whole mount histological sections after prostatectomy will be obtained (Aim 1). Four different MR protocols will be obtained for each patient study -- T1-, T2-weighted, dynamic contrast-enhanced, and diffusion imaging. The inclusion of histological data will allow for precise determination of CAP regions via H&E staining. In order to train the CAD system to automatically identify CAP on in vivo MRI accurate determination of spatial location of cancer in vivo is required. Aim 2 involves determination of spatial extent of CAP (tumor ground truth) in vivo by first registering the whole mount histological sections with the corresponding ex vivo MRI images. Once the spatial location of CAP has been thus determined on ex vivo MRI, these images are then registered with the corresponding in vivo MRI studies. Aim 3 involves building and evaluating the CAD system for detecting CAP on the high resolution in vivo MRI and MRSI studies. This project will be a collaborative effort between investigators at Rutgers University and the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN). Aim 1 (Data Generation) will be carried out at UPENN while Aims 2 (Tumor ground truth generation) and 3 (CAD model) will be done at Rutgers. 1 PI: Madabhushi, Anant Prostatic adenocarcinoma (CAP) is the second most common malignancy among men with an estimated 230,000 new cases in the USA in 2004. The current protocol to diagnose CAP in the USA is to have patients with elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels undergo a trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS)-directed biopsy.

"High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Understanding normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and neonates is a key factor in early detection of developmental disorders. This project proposal seeks to develop and refine novel magnetic resonance image reconstruction and analysis methodology to allow, for the first time, the mapping of in-utero fetal brain development. One of the most common abnormalities detected by clinical imaging of the developing fetal brain is ventriculomegaly, which, despite the absence of other clinical or imaging findings, is associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities in infancy and childhood in up to 50% of cases. Although ultrasound allows diagnosis of the condition, it has not been able to distinguish those fetus that will have poor neurological outcome from those with normal outcome. Recent developments in fast magnetic resonance imaging have permitted the use of MRI to study the fetal anatomy and this technique is now being routinely used at a small number of sites around the world including UCSF. However, MR imaging of the fetal brain is still challenging because of imaging distortions caused by motion of the fetus within the mother and by artifacts caused by the surrounding maternal anatomy. Higher resolution or 3D acquisitions are not possible because of motion of the fetus during the acquisition time^ required. The current clinical 2D slice data individually provide limited resolution and contrast and, most importantly, often contain severe motion corruption between slices. This project is motivated by the observation that it is possible to apply computer vision and image processing techniques to correct relative motion between the multiple stacks of low resolution fetal slices, and create a single volumetric image with high isotropic 3D resolution and consistent geometry. Such higher resolution images provide structure that may be analyzed using computational morphometric techniques that can detect subtle focal differences in the pattern of tissue volume, location and surface folding. This project will combine such powerful techniques with extensive fetal and neonatal imaging experience at UCSF, allowing direct clinical application of the methodology to study morphologic aberrations associated with ventriculomegaly and to correlate these with clinical outcome. The ability to apply these computational techniques to in-utero data will provide an entirely new view of the developing brain, which promises to shed new light on early developmental problems both in fetuses and premature neonates.           n/a",High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI,7668441,R01NS055064,"['Anatomy', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evolution', 'Fetus', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurological outcome', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Premature Infant', 'Prematurity of fetus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'insight', 'neonate', 'novel', 'premature', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2009,275279,0.020222306068820084

"Bayesian Parallel Imaging For Arbitrarily Sampled MR Data Using Edge-Preserving S    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful imaging tool but many important clinical applications are limited by long scan times and/or poor SNR. This proposal aims to improve the speed of MRI without losing SNR, through a Bayesian inference approach. Improvement in scan speed can enable new time-critical clinical and diagnostic MR applications, like cardiac imaging, time-resolved 4D coronary angiography, high-resolution volumetric brain imaging, dynamic contrast enhanced imaging, etc. A Bayesian framework for the reconstruction of raw MR data from multiple coils in parallel will be developed. This framework makes it possible to reduce the time taken during scanning multiple times by reducing the sampling rate of raw MR data. Our method will be generally applicable to most MR imaging modalities, targets and sampling schemes. Our method will then be validated and tested on the specific clinical application of volumetric structural brain imaging, which is an important procedure for the detection and diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, tumors, white matter lesions, measuring brain atrophy and hippocampal subfields, etc. The main goal of this project is to create a set of computational tools to perform the reconstruction of accelerated MRI data on arbitrary imaging targets, modalities and acquisition schemes, including random sampling schemes. Design of models to capture prior spatial information about images will be undertaken. Finally, the method will be validated on structural brain data in terms of metrics like SNR, partial voluming, test- retest repeatability, and the performance of subsequent processing steps like image segmentation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project has the potential to make clinical MR imaging much faster than currently possible. This will make many time-critical clinical applications of MRI more feasible, for instance real-time MRI of the heart.

"AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 1 million people in the US will experience a heart attack or sudden cardiac death. A large percentage of these patients have no prior symptoms of any kind but suffer from silent heart disease (ischemia), which may cause a heart attack at any time. Currently there is no reliable screening method to identify people who may have silent heart disease and therefore are at risk of ""heart attack"".       We seek to extract additional data from a non-invasive Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the heart (commonly used in most imaging centers), which will better identify patients who are ""vulnerable"" to sudden heart attack. These images are acquired without contrast agents, as a common screening test for measuring coronary calcium, another clinical marker of coronary artery disease. We will prove that additional information about cardiovascular risk can be obtained by quantifying pericardial fat surrounding the heart in these cardiac CT images. Although this information exists in the cardiac CT scans acquired today, it is ignored in clinical practice because currently there are no tools to measure it automatically and reliably, and no information regarding its significance for a given patient.       We will develop fully automated, accurate, new computer software for quantitation of pericardial fat from cardiac CT images acquired for routine assessment of coronary calcium. We plan to achieve complete automation and accuracy, by applying a combination of robust and effective algorithms in machine learning with anatomical knowledge. We aim to prove that the developed automatic software will be as accurate, and more reproducible than experienced imaging physicians in quantifying pericardial fat, and will accomplish the measurement in a fraction of the time. Such software could be immediately made available worldwide to standard imaging workstations. For the first time, this will allow its use as a standard practical imaging tool for cardiovascular risk assessment, without requiring additional time, imaging or radiation risk to the patient.       We will also show that this new quantitative information has important additional value compared to other clinical cardiovascular risk factors and information from blood samples (such as cholesterol, glucose and CRP), and the amount of calcium in the patient's coronary arteries seen on CT scans, and establish its significance in the prediction of silent heart disease.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This new research will allow accurate prediction of who might be more likely to have heart disease which may ultimately cause a heart attack. It will allow doctors to identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed to avoid a heart attack, or more extensive testing, could be recommended, to confirm or rule out heart disease.          n/a",AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR,7470355,R21EB006829,"['Abdomen', 'Algorithms', 'Automation', 'Biochemical', 'Blood specimen', 'C-reactive protein', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Invasive', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patients', 'Pericardial body location', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Score', 'Screening procedure', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Today', 'Visceral', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cysteine rich protein', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'human FAT protein', 'indexing', 'novel', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool', 'waist circumference']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2008,245025,0.03515782735380783
"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase. Dementia has many possible underlying causes and several different causes are at work in most elderly demented subjects. In this grant, we will use modern brain imaging to identify specific mechanisms underlying progression to dementia.          n/a",Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging,7522303,R01AG011378,"['6-hydroxybenzothiazole', 'Abbreviations', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease Pathway', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Amyloidosis', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Appendix', 'Applications Grants', 'Attenuated', 'Autopsy', 'Base of the Brain', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Chromosome Pairing', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Correlation Studies', 'Critiques', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inositol', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'N-acetylaspartate', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pittsburgh Compound-B', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scheme', 'Senile Plaques', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Spin Labels', 'Staging', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Syndrome', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'amyloid imaging', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'molecular imaging', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'tool']",NIA,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2008,868308,-0.007205087233659608
"Detecting Prostate Cancer using multi-protocol 3 Tesla in vivo MRI and MRS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PI: Madabhushi, Anant Early detection of prostatic adenocarcinoma (CAP) offers the best hope of curing it. Currently, the only way to definitively diagnose CAP is through histological analysis of excised tissue, obtained via blind sextant trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS)-directed biopsies. However, the accuracy of TRUS biopsies is only 20-25% for elevated PSA levels. Recently, high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) has been shown to be superior to ultrasound in visualizing prostatic structures. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) refers to the use of computer programs in assisting radiologists detect abnormalities from radiological images. The aim of this project is to develop a CAD system to detect prostate cancer from multi-protocol 3 Tesla in vivo MRI and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic (MRS) Imaging (MRSI). The initial higher costs associated with MRI will be offset by a reduction in unnecessary biopsies and an increase in the number of cancers detected via biopsy. The long term goals of this work are to motivate use of CAD with high resolution MRI/MRSI:- 1. For early detection of CAP in moderate to high risk patients and thereby reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies and radical prostatectomies. 2. Improving cancer detection rates by replacing TRUS with CAD-assisted MRI guided prostate biopsies. 3. For improved target dose conformality in prostate therapy. 4. For assessing quantitative response to anti-cancer therapy. The proposed work comprises a total of 3 specific aims and 10 tasks. A total of 40 anonymised patient data sets comprising multi-protocol 3 Tesla (T) in vivo MRI/MRSI scans before and multi-protocol 3 T ex vivo MRI/MRSI scans with accompanying whole mount histological sections after prostatectomy will be obtained (Aim 1). Four different MR protocols will be obtained for each patient study -- T1-, T2-weighted, dynamic contrast-enhanced, and diffusion imaging. The inclusion of histological data will allow for precise determination of CAP regions via H&E staining. In order to train the CAD system to automatically identify CAP on in vivo MRI accurate determination of spatial location of cancer in vivo is required. Aim 2 involves determination of spatial extent of CAP (tumor ground truth) in vivo by first registering the whole mount histological sections with the corresponding ex vivo MRI images. Once the spatial location of CAP has been thus determined on ex vivo MRI, these images are then registered with the corresponding in vivo MRI studies. Aim 3 involves building and evaluating the CAD system for detecting CAP on the high resolution in vivo MRI and MRSI studies. This project will be a collaborative effort between investigators at Rutgers University and the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN). Aim 1 (Data Generation) will be carried out at UPENN while Aims 2 (Tumor ground truth generation) and 3 (CAD model) will be done at Rutgers. 1 PI: Madabhushi, Anant Prostatic adenocarcinoma (CAP) is the second most common malignancy among men with an estimated 230,000 new cases in the USA in 2004. The current protocol to diagnose CAP in the USA is to have patients with elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels undergo a trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS)-directed biopsy.

The aim of this project is to develop a CAD system to detect prostate cancer from multi-protocol 3 Tesla in vivo MRI and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic (MRS) Imaging (MRSI). The initial higher costs associated with MRI will be offset by a reduction in unnecessary biopsies and an increase in the number of cancers detected via biopsy. The long term goals of this work are to motivate use of CAD with high resolution MRI/MRSI:- 1. For early detection of CAP in moderate to high risk patients and thereby reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies and radical prostatectomies. 2. Improving cancer detection rates by replacing TRUS with CAD-assisted MRI guided prostate biopsies. 3. For improved target dose conformality in prostate therapy. 4. For assessing quantitative response to anti-cancer therapy. The proposed work comprises a total of 3 specific aims and 10 tasks. A total of 40 anonymised patient data sets comprising multi-protocol 3 Tesla (T) in vivo MRI/MRSI scans before and multi-protocol 3 T ex vivo MRI/MRSI scans with accompanying whole mount histological sections after prostatectomy will be obtained (Aim 1). Four different MR protocols will be obtained for each patient study -- T1-, T2-weighted, dynamic contrast-enhanced, and diffusion imaging. The inclusion of histological data will allow for precise determination of CAP regions via H&E staining. In order to train the CAD system to automatically identify CAP on in vivo MRI accurate determination of spatial location of cancer in vivo is required. Aim 2 involves determination of spatial extent of CAP (tumor ground truth) in vivo by first registering the whole mount histological sections with the corresponding ex vivo MRI images. Once the spatial location of CAP has been thus determined on ex vivo MRI, these images are then registered with the corresponding in vivo MRI studies. Aim 3 involves building and evaluating the CAD system for detecting CAP on the high resolution in vivo MRI and MRSI studies. This project will be a collaborative effort between investigators at Rutgers University and the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN). Aim 1 (Data Generation) will be carried out at UPENN while Aims 2 (Tumor ground truth generation) and 3 (CAD model) will be done at Rutgers. 1 PI: Madabhushi, Anant Prostatic adenocarcinoma (CAP) is the second most common malignancy among men with an estimated 230,000 new cases in the USA in 2004. The current protocol to diagnose CAP in the USA is to have patients with elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels undergo a trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS)-directed biopsy. However, several studies have reported (1) that using PSA alone as a screening test results in a large number of unnecessary biopsies and (2) there is a high false negative rate associated with TRUS. The goal of this work is to integrate computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) with multi-protocol high resolution in vivo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) in order to increase the sensitivity and specificity of prostate cancer detection. The proposed work has translational implications in, structures (urethra and rectal wall) by directing therapy towards specific areas determined as tumor by CAD.           n/a",Detecting Prostate Cancer using multi-protocol 3 Tesla in vivo MRI and MRS,7241154,R21CA127186,"['Agreement', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blinded', 'Cancer Detection', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Numbers', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Adenocarcinoma', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Prostatectomy', 'Prostatic', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Rate', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Texture', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Urethra', 'Weight', 'Work', 'blind', 'cancer site', 'cancer therapy', 'computer program', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'men', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'rectal', 'response', 'tumor']",NCI,RUTGERS THE ST UNIV OF NJ NEW BRUNSWICK,R21,2007,160215,0.03713728321525116
"High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Understanding normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and neonates is a key factor in early detection of developmental disorders. This project proposal seeks to develop and refine novel magnetic resonance image reconstruction and analysis methodology to allow, for the first time, the mapping of in-utero fetal brain development. One of the most common abnormalities detected by clinical imaging of the developing fetal brain is ventriculomegaly, which, despite the absence of other clinical or imaging findings, is associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities in infancy and childhood in up to 50% of cases. Although ultrasound allows diagnosis of the condition, it has not been able to distinguish those fetus that will have poor neurological outcome from those with normal outcome. Recent developments in fast magnetic resonance imaging have permitted the use of MRI to study the fetal anatomy and this technique is now being routinely used at a small number of sites around the world including UCSF. However, MR imaging of the fetal brain is still challenging because of imaging distortions caused by motion of the fetus within the mother and by artifacts caused by the surrounding maternal anatomy. Higher resolution or 3D acquisitions are not possible because of motion of the fetus during the acquisition time^ required. The current clinical 2D slice data individually provide limited resolution and contrast and, most importantly, often contain severe motion corruption between slices. This project is motivated by the observation that it is possible to apply computer vision and image processing techniques to correct relative motion between the multiple stacks of low resolution fetal slices, and create a single volumetric image with high isotropic 3D resolution and consistent geometry. Such higher resolution images provide structure that may be analyzed using computational morphometric techniques that can detect subtle focal differences in the pattern of tissue volume, location and surface folding. This project will combine such powerful techniques with extensive fetal and neonatal imaging experience at UCSF, allowing direct clinical application of the methodology to study morphologic aberrations associated with ventriculomegaly and to correlate these with clinical outcome. The ability to apply these computational techniques to in-utero data will provide an entirely new view of the developing brain, which promises to shed new light on early developmental problems both in fetuses and premature neonates.           n/a",High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI,7241562,R01NS055064,"['Anatomy', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evolution', 'Fetus', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infant Development', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurological outcome', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Premature Infant', 'Range', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'insight', 'neonate', 'novel', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO,R01,2007,275279,0.020222306068820084
"Sono-Contrast Induced Functional Imaging/Spectroscopy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    An innovative method of in vivo imaging for detection and pathophysiological classification of relatively superficial malignancies is proposed. The technique, sono-contrast induced functional imaging and spectroscopy (SCIFIS), builds upon existing diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) in the near infrared region but uses standing wave focused ultrasound deposition as a contrast agent to improve the sensitivity and specificity of DRS. The overall goal is to develop a non-invasive, real-time modality for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and post-treatment surveillance.   The basis of the proposed in vivo imaging method is that acoustic radiation force delivered by focused ultrasound forming a standing wave causes reversible compression of the vasculature and/or blood flow stasis, and thus temporal changes in hemoglobin concentration, which are registered in the dynamic (pre- and post-insonification) observation of near-infrared spectra. By intersecting the optical path and the acoustic path at an angle and subtracting measured spectra pre- and post-deposition of sono-contrast, signatures of vascular pathophysiology can be identified at the intersecting location.   In the R21 phase, C3H mice inoculated with murine mammary tumors on the left legs will undergo in vivo SCIFIS measurement prior to immunohistochemical examination.

"Automated Plaque Detection and Classification using MRI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Acute thrombus formation on disrupted/eroded human atherosclerotic lesions plays a critical role on the onset of acute coronary syndromes and progression of atherosclerosis.

"Sub-millimeter Simultaneous SPECT-CT for Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    We are proposing to develop a single, bench-top animal scanner that will acquire both functional SPECT images and anatomical CT images with sub-millimeter spatial resolution for both imaging modalities.

This would allow investigators to perform serial imaging studies in the same animal at multiple time points to investigate tumor growth, tissue pathology, the effects of therapy, and the mechanism of action of new diagnostic agents.

"Accelerated x-ray therapy planning system PEREGRINE DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computerized radiation therapy planning systems (RTP) are essential in Radiation Oncology for quantitative evaluation of radiation doses prior to patient treatment. Among currently available computational methods, the Monte Carlo method of calculating dose distributionsis most universal and accurate. It is believed that Monte Carlo software packages will become a central part of future RTP systems. The limiting problem with current Monte Carlo codes is the length of time (CPU time) required for calculations even when using state-of-the-art hardware. An increase in efficiency of Monte Carlo codes has been demonstrated using algorithms known as variance-reduction techniques (VR techniques), but the calculation times are still too long for routine  clinical use. While there is no single VR technique that would make Monte Carlo code clinically viable, a combination of such techniques usually results in improved performance. At present, the only commercial RTP system using Monte Carlo code for photon dose calculations is PEREGRINE from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and NOMOS Corporation. PEREGRINE uses several VR techniques. However, it is estimated that a further reduction in CPU time by a factor of 10 would be required to have a clinically efficient system.  Our theoretical study and subsequent Monte Carlo results support a new variance-reduction technique (NVR) for photon-beam dose calculations. It is shown that NVR yields up to a 5-fold reduction in CPU time. The long-term objective of the project is to reduce PEREGRIN's CPU time from currently several hours to several; minutes. This will require a combination of NVR with other VR techniques. Within this scope, the specific aims of Phase I are:  1. Development, implementation and validation of a PEREGRINE-specific NVR algorithm.  2. Benchmarking of NVR over the range of clinically useful energies in homogeneous and heterogeneous phantoms.  3. Validation of NVR in the case of patient-specific Monte Carlo calculations using CT based patient anatomy. n/a",Accelerated x-ray therapy planning system PEREGRINE,6787955,R41CA108088,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'computed axial tomography', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'electromagnetic radiation', 'mathematics', 'patient care planning', 'radiation dosage', 'radiation therapy', 'technology /technique development']",NCI,NOMOS CORPORATION,R41,2004,100000,0.038875080742132535

Among the different imaging modalities, MRI seems to be the most promising in terms of discrimination and due to its non-invasive nature. We propose to develop an automated MRI image analysis system for detecting, measuring, and classifying atherosclerotic plaques. The proposed project will be conducted by a highly experienced team of experts in signal processing, pattern recognition, statistics, and product development in close collaboration with key cardiovascular researchers, with specific expertise in MRI imaging and atherosclerosis. Automation would establish a fast, objective (observer-independent), and standard diagnostic measure of plaque burden, allowing for comparison of results between laboratories, throughout longitudinal studies, and across different imaging equipment. In a clinical setting, this system would greatly reduce the diagnostic costs involved in measuring the degree of stenosis and detecting thrombosis-prone plaques. n/a",Automated Plaque Detection and Classification using MRI,6643700,R43HL071470,"['artificial intelligence', ' atherosclerotic plaque', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical automation', ' cardiovascular disorder diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' human data', ' image processing', ' magnetic resonance imaging']",NHLBI,ISCHEM CORPORATION,R43,2003,99850,0.01980599205575335
"Sub-millimeter Simultaneous SPECT-CT for Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    We are proposing to develop a single, bench-top animal scanner that will acquire both functional SPECT images and anatomical CT images with sub-millimeter spatial resolution for both imaging modalities. The sub-mm SPECT-CT will provide a technique for noninvasive functional imaging in mice for a wide range of applications, including the development of new radio-pharmaceuticals, assessment of new therapeutic approaches, and investigation of fundamental biological processes in transgenic and knockout mice. This would allow investigators to perform serial imaging studies in the same animal at multiple time points to investigate tumor growth, tissue pathology, the effects of therapy, and the mechanism of action of new diagnostic agents. The system will have wide applicability and significant impact in research that uses small animals to advance our understanding of human disease processes. During phase I we successfully completed all proposed feasibility studies to demonstrate SPECT/CT with gamma performance of 1.3mm intrinsic spatial resolution, E range from 30keV to 350keV, and,deltaE/E=12% at 140keV and - 100mu m CT capability from a 50xS0mm CMOS based digital x-ray detector. In addition, we acquired outstanding dual SPECT-CT images of euthanized mice. During the phase II project we will complete the integration of the high-resolution SPECT and transmission CT subsystems and develop all necessary hardware and software. The result will be a fully functional dual-modality prototype scanner for anatomical and quantitative metabolic imaging of small animals.         n/a",Sub-millimeter Simultaneous SPECT-CT for Imaging,6693866,R44RR016393,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' computed axial tomography', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' image processing', ' laboratory mouse', ' noninvasive diagnosis', ' single photon emission computed tomography', ' technology /technique development', ' whole body imaging /scanning']",NCRR,"PHOTON IMAGING, INC.",R44,2003,379863,0.01904224902265024
"SEED LOCALIZER FOR IMAGE GUIDED PROSTATE BRACHYTHERAPY Permanent implantation of radioactive seeds is a viable and effective therapeutic option widely used today for early-stage prostate cancer. Compared to external radiation therapy in which radiation must penetrate healthy tissues in order to reach cancer cells, implantation of low-energy radionuclides permits highly localized delivery of radiation.  Although the implant procedure has improved in recent years with the help of computerized treatment planning and image guidance techniques, significant enhancement of clinical outcome is expected from implementation of real-time intraoperative dosimetry and optimization. Intraoperative evaluation of dose delivery would permit identification of underdosed regions and remedial seed placement, thus ensuring that the entire prostate volume receive the prescribed dose.  However, before the concept can be realized, the problem of real-time seed localization must be solved.  This is the focus of this investigation.  The specific aims of the project include development of (1) a fully automated method to segment seed images from the fluoroscopic data and (2) a fully automated method to identify individual seed positions including those that are superposed.

"Ultrasonic Registration of Knee Anatomy to MRI Images  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will investigate the feasibility of using intra-operative ultrasound (US) images to noninvasively register the bone surfaces of the knee to preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) images. A surgical navigation system, KneeNav, is being developed by CASurgica for intraoperatively planning the proper location of ligament attachment sites and drill tunnel locations and then guiding the surgeon to execute the plan. Despite agreement on the correct points of insertion, great variability exists in tunnel placement among surgeons and the rate of misplaced tunnels in ACL reconstruction surgery has been reported to be between 10-40 percent. Malpositioning of the bone tunnels is the main reason for revision surgery. The proposed research would increase the accuracy of the procedure versus current videoscopic techniques or versus competitive image guidance systems. The research plan is to establish a ""gold standard"" for registration accuracy using reconstructed CT scans, point-based surface matching algorithms, and optical tracking. Reconstructed MR models will be substituted for CT models and the accuracy reassessed. The US probe will then be calibrated and US surface collection will then be substituted for point based collection and the accuracy reassessed. Finally, registration of US directly to MR without reconstruction will be assessed.

"Reliable and Robust ECG Gating Signal for MR Imaging The focus of this project is to develop and evaluate a noel and reliable system for ECG triggering during cardiac MR imaging. Understanding the mechanism of heart failure and cardiomyopathy using MRI requires reliable and robust ECG gating (or triggering). To provide effective ECG gating, the first specific aim of this Phase I project is to design and develop an ECG lead system and concomitant signal processing methodology to allow for improved ECG detection with the magnetic. Our preliminary data describing our optimal vector signal set approach , coupled with a dual derivative ECG detections scheme, appear to be effective in reliably detecting the ECG during MR imaging. An improved ECG trigger will provide cardiac MRI imaging without the artifacts of cardiac and respiratory motion. Our second specific aim is to design and develop a wireless (telemetry) infrared (IR) system for ECG trigger transmission to eliminate the need for either wiring or a fiber optic cable during MRI examinations. Additionally preliminary data demonstrates the capability of our IR telemetry system to transmit the ECG in laboratory tests. Our optimal telemetry system will also mitigate against many of the artifacts involved in the development of an effective MRI ECG trigger. During Phase I we will demonstrate the feasibility of our system by evaluating system performance in 20 human subjects undergoing cardiac MR imaging. We believe our approach should provide a reliable and robust ECG gated trigger with minimal delay from the onset of the R-wave. Such a trigger would minimize blurring artifacts from cardiac and respiratory motion and improve MR tagging studies. Should our phase I project be successful, we would develop a real-time implementation of the entire system in an expanded Phase II biomedical engineering and extended clinical study. A successful Phase I and II project would likely receive commercial backing from a major MRI instrument manufacturer.

"Radionuclide imaging and therapy dosimetry system   DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant): The objective of this Phase I proposal is       to determine the scientific, technical, and commercial merit and feasibility of      an integrated commercial treatment planning and dosimetry system (RTDS) for          radionuclide therapy and radionuclide imaging, especially for                        radioimmunotherapy (AlT). In clinical and experimental RIT, knowledge of the         absorbed dose in normal organs and tumors is essential in gaining an                 understanding of normal tissue toxicity and tumor dose response. This project        will lead to a user-friendly software program allowing physicist/physicians to       perform dosimetry analysis during AlT treatment. The software package will be        integrated into the CMS FOCUS 3D radiation treatment planning system, allowing       the delineation of organs and tumors, the co-registration of CT and nuclear          medicine image sets, and the estimation and visualization of absorbed dose in        critical tissues. User will have the option to purchase the RTDS module to           perform treatment planning and dosimetry calculation for patients receiving          radionuclide imaging and/or therapy. It will be the first commercially               available treatment planning system of this kind and will be fully supported by      CMS, inc. More importantly, this project will provide a general framework to         perform AlT dosimetry and the opportunity to standardize the dosimetry               technique and methodology used in RIT.

"METHODS FOR ANALYSIS OF TAGGED MR CARDIAC IMAGES DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract):  The aim of this proposal       is to further develop and validate algorithms for analysis of SPAMM MR           cardiac images based on novel spline methods.  MRI is unique in its ability      to non-invasively and selectively alter tissue magnetization, and create         tagged patterns within the deforming tissue such as the heart muscle.  The       resulting pattern defines a time-varying curvilinear coordinate system on        the underlying tissue, allowing for precise and quantitative measurement of      tissue motion and deformation.  The investigators are developing two             frameworks for analysis of SPAMM tagged images, both of these aimed at           providing a more automated and reproducible approach to analysis of SPAMM        data, as well as providing dense 3-D displacement information at all points      within the LV myocardium.  The investigators propose to (a) further develop      and extend our analyses techniques.  The extensions considered will all be       related and based on currently developed computer vision-based techniques        for regional LV wall motion analysis, that operates either on a sequence of      SA slice stacks or on a time sequence of single slice.  (b) The                  investigators will validate the motion tracking methods by comparing ""true""      and algorithm-estimated motion trajectories:  1) on dense field of points        derived from 3-D tagged computer models of objects that simulate the moving      LV, 2) on dense field of points derived from Finite Element Model                simulations of the constitutive equations of LV deformations (once again tag     planes will be superimposed on the time course of simulated geometries), 3)      on selected points in the LV myocardium of the in vivo heart using a porcine     model.

"Integrating Quantitative MRI and Artificial Intelligence to Improve Prostate Cancer Classification PROJECT SUMMARY Prostate cancer (PCa) develops in sixteen percent of males and is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men in the United States. While incidence is high, PCa presents with a wide range of aggressiveness and in many cases does not develop into life-threatening aggressive cancer. Current diagnostic strategies may fail to detect all instances of clinically significant PCa and have limited ability to accurately distinguish clinically significant from indolent PCa due to incomplete and inconsistent information. This not only subjects patients to detrimental co-morbidities including overtreatment and undertreatment, but also exacerbates already significant healthcare costs. Consequently, there is an urgent clinical need to achieve accurate detection and classification of clinically significant PCa and determine the appropriate management strategy. Multi-parametric MRI (mp-MRI), consisting of T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging, has emerged as the preferred imaging technique for non-invasive detection and grading of PCa. However, the current standardized scoring system for mp-MRI, Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) v2, has limited ability to distinguish between indolent and clinically significant PCa, with sensitivity and specificity in the range of 60-85%. This suboptimal accuracy and considerable variation in performance is mainly due to the fact that current PI-RADS scoring is based on qualitative analysis and subjective interpretation of mp-MRI, confounded by scanner- and patient-specific variations, including B1+ inhomogeneity, arterial input function, and susceptibility and eddy current effects. This proposal aims to overcome these critical limitations of current mp-MRI by establishing a new MRI-based artificial intelligence based on two synergistic innovations: 1) new quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI analysis techniques and diffusion-weighted MRI acquisition methods that minimize scanner- and patient-specific variations, and 2) novel multi-class deep learning models that can fully integrate the multi-labeled quantitative mp- MRI information. By leveraging the synergy between existing mp-MRI data and to-be-acquired quantitative mp- MRI data with subsequent mapping of all lesions at whole-mount histopathology, the proposed MRI-based deep learning model will be evaluated for detection and classification of clinically significant PCa, compared with the current standard-of-care, PI-RADS v2. Completion of this project will lead to the creation, clinical deployment, and pivotal validation of a new MRI-based artificial intelligence that achieves unprecedented accuracy for detection and classification of clinically significant PCa, thereby increasing confidence in separating indolent PCa from significant PCa and reducing unnecessary biopsies, undertreatment, and overtreatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current diagnostic strategies can fail to accurately detect and classify clinically significant prostate cancer, leading to detrimental overtreatment and undertreatment. This research project aims to jointly develop and integrate innovative quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and artificial intelligence algorithms to achieve significantly improved accuracy for detection and classification of clinically significant prostate cancer. The new MRI- based artificial intelligence will be a transformative technology to reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies and enhance decision making for patient management to avoid overtreatment and undertreatment of prostate cancer.",Integrating Quantitative MRI and Artificial Intelligence to Improve Prostate Cancer Classification,9946182,R01CA248506,"['Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Incidence', 'Indolent', 'Information Systems', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Predisposition', 'Prostate', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Texture', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer classification', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'contrast enhanced', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diffusion weighted', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'male', 'men', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'prisma', 'prospective', 'prostate biopsy', 'standard of care', 'synergism']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,567651,0.027638214293536398
"Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning Cerebrovascular disease remains a common cause of death and major disability in the United States, and identifying and preventing strokes should be a high priority. Direct measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) is challeng- ing in these patients, since we do not have a non-invasive, radiation-free imaging method that has been appropriately validated against gold standard techniques. This is important, because there is compelling evidence that measuring the CBF change before and after a stress test meant to increase CBF (a measurement known as cerebrovascular reserve [CVR]) can identify patients at increased stroke risk. Stress tests have been a mainstay of the diagnostic workup of cardiology patients for many years, and we believe strongly that their use will benefit cerebrovascular disease patients as well.

The goals of this project are • to improve non-contrast, radiation-free arterial spin label MRI methods  using deep learning, a powerful form of artificial intelligence that has  shown tremendous progress for computer vision • to validate these methods against a CBF gold-standard, oxygen-15 water  PET, using simultaneous PET/MRI, using an adaptive “play-the-winner” strategy • to apply them to assess gender differences in CVR and test their  reproducibility, with the goal of establishing age and gender normative  ranges to better identify outliers.",Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning,9961582,R01EB025220,"['Acetazolamide', 'Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Bypass', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Carotid Stenosis', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consensus', 'Cytolysis', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Excision', 'Gadolinium', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'ImProv', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Japanese Population', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Nutrient', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Premenopause', 'Procedures', 'Radiation', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Spin Labels', 'Stress Tests', 'Stroke prevention', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Waste Products', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Xenon', 'base', 'blood flow measurement', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'cerebrovascular', 'cerebrovascular imaging', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'design', 'direct application', 'disability', 'evidence based guidelines', 'gender difference', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning network', 'men', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel strategies', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'response', 'stressor', 'stroke risk', 'systematic review', 'time use', 'tool']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,565941,0.028595673832935632
"TOPIC 389 - INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE FOR RADIATION THERAPY PLANNING INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE FOR RADIATION THERAPY PLANNING Besides surgery, radiotherapy is the most effective treatment modality for localized prostate cancer. The success of radiotherapy stems from the exploit of a therapeutic window in tumor response and normal tissue tolerance which maximizes the chance of sterilizing the tumor while sparing the surrounding normal tissue from severe damage. This requires an accurate and individualized radiation dose distribution generated from the examination of the patient’s medical images. Radiation therapy is technically complex and labor intensive. Intensive human supervision and intervention are needed throughout the path of patient care.   Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies are adept at automating workflows and tasks—in this case the development of cancer treatment plans. We believe that this machine learning has incredible potential to address inherent problems in the existing treatment planning workflow. Our approach will mitigate the current issues with treatment planning, integrate seamlessly with day-to-day operations, and will serve as a treatment solution that benefits patients in a way that limits their risk and extends their lives.   The goal of this project is to develop a start-to-end prostate cancer treatment planning system. We will work with three expert radiation oncology teams to archive existing patient data for use in training of artificial intelligence algorithms. These algorithms will enable high quality plans to be generated with ease. At the completion of Phase I, we will have a prototype interface that will allow users to create treatment plans and segmentation using artificial intelligence algorithms. Additionally, users will be able to evaluate these plans against other expert plans and against the training data. n/a",TOPIC 389 - INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE FOR RADIATION THERAPY PLANNING,10196876,5N91019C00053,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cancer Patient', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Pythons', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation therapy', 'Risk', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'data reduction', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'intelligent algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'response', 'stem', 'success', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'web interface']",NCI,"RADIASOFT, LLC",N43,2020,55000,0.013501316465635438
"Low- and Zero-dose Contrast-enhanced MRI Using Deep Learning Project Summary Motivation: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are used in approximately a third of all MRI scans. The unique relaxation parameters of GBCAs create indispensable image contrast for a wide range of clinical applications, such as angiography and tumor detection. However, the usage of GBCAs has been linked to the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). NSF can be painful, cause severe disability, and even death. The risk of developing NSF prevents millions of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) from receiving contrast-enhanced MRI exams. The recent identification of gadolinium deposition within the brain and body has raised additional safety concerns about the usage of GBCAs. Studies have demonstrated increased signal intensity on the unenhanced T1-weighted MR images that is correlated with previous GBCA exposure, and this gadolinium retention is independent of renal function. While initial reports focused on linear GBCAs, more recent reports show that gadolinium deposition occurs with macrocyclic GBCAs as well, albeit at lower levels. FDA has recently issued warnings about gadolinium retention following contrast-enhanced MRI, and required GBCA manufacturers to conduct human and animal studies to further assess the safety of these contrast agents. This project addresses these concerns by developing low-dose and zero-dose contrast-enhanced MRI using artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL). Approach: This fast-track project has two phases and three aims. Aim 1 (Phase I) is to develop a DL method that can synthesize full-dose contrast-enhanced MR images using pre-contrast images and contrast-enhanced images acquired with only 10% of standard GBCA dose. A software infrastructure will be constructed to seamlessly integrate the DL software between MR scanners and PACS. Aim 2 (Phase II) is to develop a DL method that can synthesize full-dose contrast-enhanced MR images using GBCA-free acquisitions with different image contrast. In Aim 3 (Phase II), we will clinically validate and evaluate both low-dose and zero-dose DL methods, including on patients with mild- to-moderate CKD. Non-inferiority tests and diagnostic performance of the synthesized full-dose images compared to the true full-dose images will be performed. Significance: This work will lead to safer contrast-enhanced MRI. The low-dose and zero-dose contrast-enhanced MRI method will benefit not only millions of patients with advanced CKD, who cannot currently undergo contrast-enhanced MRI, but many more patients with normal kidney function, who are at the risk of gadolinium retention after contrast-enhanced MRI. Project Narrative Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are widely used in MRI exams to create indispensable image contrast for monitoring treatment and investigating pathology and function. However, the usage of GBCAs has been linked to the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, preventing patients with advanced chronic kidney disease from receiving contrast-enhanced MRI exams, as well as potential gadolinium deposition in the body and brain for patients with normal kidney function.

"Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization Project Summary Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most diagnosed form of non-cutaneous cancer in US men. The selection of patients who require immediate treatment from those suitable for active surveillance currently relies on non- specific and inaccurate measurements. A method that allows clinicians to more confidently discriminate clinically relevant from non-life-threatening tumors is needed to improve patient management. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is the preferred non-invasive imaging modality for characterizing primary PCa. However, its accuracy for detecting clinically significant PCa is variable. We propose to address this limitation by combining mpMRI with positron emission tomography (PET) with a PCa-specific radiotracer and using advanced multimodal machine learning models (i.e. radiomics and deep learning) to characterize tumor aggressiveness based on the imaging data. Recently, scanners capable of simultaneous PET and MR data acquisition in human subjects have become commercially available. An integrated MR-PET scanner is the ideal tool for comparing MR and PET derived image features to identify those that provide complementary information and build a hybrid PET-mpMRI model that most accurately identifies clinically significant tumors. While this novel technology allows the acquisition of perfectly coregistered complementary anatomical, functional and metabolic data in a single imaging session, a new challenge needs to first be addressed to obtain quantitatively accurate PET data. In an integrated MR-PET scanner, the information needed for PET attenuation correction (AC) has to be derived from the MR data and the methods currently available for this task are inadequate for advanced quantitative studies. We have formed an academic-industrial partnership to accelerate the translation of multimodal MR-PET machine learning approaches into PCa research and clinical applications by addressing the AC challenge and validating machine learning models for detecting clinically significant disease against gold standard histopathology in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Specifically, we will: (1) Develop and validate an MR-based approach for obtaining quantitatively accurate PET data. We hypothesize that attenuation maps as accurate as those obtained using a 511 keV transmission source – the true gold standard for PET AC – will be obtained; (2) Identify the multimodal radiomics model that most accurately predicts PCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that the diagnostic accuracy of this approach will be superior to that offered by the stand-alone modalities; (3) Evaluate radiomics and deep learning approaches for predicting pPCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that machine learning approaches will achieve a higher predictive accuracy when applied to data acquired simultaneously than sequentially. Project narrative A better method to non-invasively characterize primary prostate cancer is needed to improve patient management. Extracting additional information from multimodality quantitative MR-PET data using machine learning approaches is expected to result in better diagnostic performance. In this work, we propose to accelerate the translation of quantitative MR-PET to prostate cancer research and clinical applications. In particular, we will develop and validate an MR-based attenuation correction approach to guarantee that quantitatively accurate PET data are obtained in an integrated MR-PET scanner and then use machine learning approaches to characterize the aggressiveness of the tumors in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.",Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization,9853761,R01CA218187,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Death Rates', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Histopathology', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kinetics', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'PSA level', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prostate', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone imaging', 'cancer classification', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'men', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'radiotracer', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tumor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,671823,0.05287392526970988
"Automatic Organ Segmentation Tool for Radiation Treatment Planning of Cancers ABSTRACT As early detection and better treatment have increased cancer patient survival rates, the importance of protecting normal organs during radiation treatment is drawing more attention, which is critical in reducing long term toxicity of cancers. To avoid excessively high radiation doses to organs-at-risk (OARs), OARs need to be correctly segmented from simulation computed tomography (CT) scans during radiation treatment planning to get an accurate dose distribution. Despite tremendous effort in developing semi- or fully-automatic segmentation solutions, current automated segmentation software, mostly using the atlas-based methods, has not yet reached the level of accuracy and robustness required for clinical usage. Therefore, in current practice, significant manual efforts are still required in the OAR segmentation process. Manual contouring suffers from inter- and intra-observer variability, as well as institutional variability where different sites adopt distinct contouring atlases and labeling criteria, thus leading to inaccuracy and variability in OAR segmentation. When OARs are very close to the treatment target, segmentation errors as small as a few millimeters can have a statistically significant impact on dosimetry distribution and outcome. In addition, it is also costly and time consuming as it can take 1-2 hours of a clinicians’ time to segment major thoracic organs due to the large number of axial slices required. In summary, an accurate and fast process for segmenting OARs in treatment planning using CT scans is needed for improving patient outcomes and reducing the cost of radiation therapy of cancers. In recent years, the rapid development of deep learning methods has revolutionized many computer-vision areas and the adoption of deep learning in medical applications has shown great success. Based on a deep-learning-based algorithm we developed that achieved better-than-human performance and ranked 1st in 2017 American Association of Physicist in Medicine Thoracic Auto-segmentation Challenge, an automatic OAR segmentation product will be developed in this project with the three aims: 1) further improve the performance and robustness of OAR segmentation algorithms, focusing on addressing the heterogeneity issue of different clinical environments; 2) further enrich the functionalities and enhance usability of the cloud- based software product; and 3) perform clinical validation study on the algorithm performance and software usability at collaborating sites. With this product, the segmentation accuracy can be improved, leading to more robust treatment plans in protecting normal organs and improved long term patient outcome. The time and cost of radiation treatment planning can be greatly reduced, contributing to a more affordable cancer treatment and reduced healthcare burden. NARRATIVE As early detection and better treatment have increased cancer patient survival rates, the importance of protecting normal organs during radiation treatment is drawing more attention. To avoid excessively high radiation doses to such organs-at-risk (OARs), they are required to be correctly segmented from simulation computed tomography (CT) scans.

"Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This “Pathway to Independence” award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position. Ultimately, she aims to become a faculty member in a radiology or bioengineering institute, where she can further research technical biomedical imaging and machine learning developments applied to the musculoskeletal system.

"Cardiac CT Deblooming PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease, killing over 370,000 Americans annu- ally2. Cardiac CT is a safe, accurate, non-invasive method widely employed for diagnosis of CAD and planning therapeutic interventions. With the current CT technology, calcium blooming artifacts severely limit the accuracy of coronary stenosis assessment. Similarly, stent blooming artifacts lead to overestimation of in-stent restenosis. As a result, many coronary CT angiography (CCTA) scans are non-diagnostic and result in patients receiving costly and invasive coronary angiography (ICA) procedures.  Based on extensive feasibility results, the goal of this project is to use deep learning innovations to fundamen- tally eliminate blooming artifacts without costly redesign of the CT hardware. A consortium between GE Re- search, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Weill Cornell Medicine will develop dedicated imaging protocols and machine learning methods to avoid or minimize blooming artifacts and evaluate the clinical impact of the proposed solutions. In Aim 1, the CT scan protocol will be optimized and paired with deep learning reconstruc- tion and post-processing algorithms to generate high-resolution CT images and prevent blooming artifacts. In Aim 2, image-domain and raw-data-domain deep learning processing algorithms will be developed to correct for residual blooming. After successful demonstration of the proposed methods on phantom scans and emulated clinical datasets, in Aim 3 the proposed CT methods will be clinically demonstrated and optimized based on 100 patients with coronary artery disease, using intravascular ultrasound as the ground-truth reference.  At the end of the project, we will have demonstrated and publicly disseminated a systematic methodology to essentially remove blooming artifacts in cardiac CT without a costly hardware upgrade. This will be another suc- cess of deep learning, enabling accurate coronary stenosis assessment and eliminating many unnecessary diag- nostic catheterizations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Blooming artifacts severely limit the accuracy of coronary stenosis assessment with cardiac CT, leading to un- necessary invasive coronary angiography procedures. The goal of this project is to eliminate blooming artifacts without costly redesign of the CT hardware, but based on optimized scan protocols and deep-learning-based image reconstruction and post-processing techniques.

"Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Abstract: Fast, reliable and accurate delineation of pelvic organs in the planning and treatment images is a long- standing, important and technically challenging problem. Its solution is highly required for state-of-the-art image-guided radiation therapy planning and treatment, as better treatment decisions rely on timely interpretation of anatomical information in the images. However, automatic segmentation in male pelvic regions is always difficult due to 1) low contrast between prostate and surrounding organs, and 2) possibly disparate shapes/appearances of bladder and rectum caused by tissue deformations. The goal of this project is to create a set of novel machine learning tools to achieve accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (e.g., prostate, bladder, and rectum) in different modalities (e.g., planning CT, treatment CT/CBCT, and MRI) for radiotherapy of prostate cancer.  Planning CT. For automatic segmentation, landmark detection is often the first step in rapidly locating the target organs. Thus, in Aim 1, we will create a novel joint landmark detection approach, based on both random forests and auto-context model, to iteratively detect all landmarks and further coordinate their detection results for achieving more accurate and consistent landmark detection results. After roughly locating organs with the aid of those detected landmarks, the second step is to accurately segment boundaries of target organs in the planning CT. Accordingly, in Aim 2, we will create a set of learning methods to a) first simultaneously predict all pelvic organ boundaries in the planning CT with the regression forests trained by labeled training data, and b) then segment all pelvic organs jointly by deforming their respective shape models. In particular, to address the limitations of conventional deformable models in assuming simple Gaussian distributions for organ shapes, a novel hierarchical sparse shape composition approach will be developed to constrain shape models during deformable segmentation.  Treatment CT/CBCT. During the course of serial radiation treatments, to quantitatively record and monitor the accumulated dose delivered to the patient, organs in the treatment image also need to be segmented. Although methods proposed in Aims 1-2 can be simply applied, as done by many conventional methods, this will lead to a) inconsistent landmark detection and b) inconsistent segmentations across different treatment days because of possible large shape/appearance changes. Accordingly, in Aim 3, we will create a novel self- learning mechanism to gradually learn and incorporate patient-specific information into both joint landmark detection and deformable segmentation steps from the increasingly acquired treatment images of patient. Thus, population data will gradually be replaced by the patient's own data to train personalized models.  MRI. To guide pelvic organ segmentation in the planning CT, MRI is now often acquired for selected patients. To this end, in Aim 4, we will develop a) a prostate MRI segmentation method by using deep learning to learn MRI-specific features for guiding landmark detection and deformable segmentation as proposed in Aims 1-2; b) a novel collaborative MRI and CT segmentation algorithm for more accurate segmentation of planning CT.  All our developed algorithms will be evaluated for their performance in clinical (treatment planning and delivery) workflow for 130 patients in UNC Cancer Hospital and also hospitals of our consultants.  Benefit for Patient Care. Development of these segmentation tools will 1) dramatically accelerate the clinical workflow, 2) reduce workload (i.e., manual interaction time) for physicians, and 3) lead to better patient outcomes with reliable and accurate segmentations of target area and critical organs. Although these tools cannot replace the expertise of physicians, they can be of great assistance to physicians. Narrative Description of Project This project aims to create a set of novel machine learning tools for accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (such as prostate, bladder, and rectum) in various imaging modalities to help radiotherapy of prostate cancer. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel joint landmark detection and boundary prediction framework for accurate segmentation of the planning CT images, 2) an innovative updating mechanism for incorporating patient-specific information from previous treatment images of same patient to progressively improve treatment CT/CBCT segmentation, and 3) a deep-learning based framework for learning MRI-specific features for prostate MRI segmentation, as well as a novel method for collaborative MRI & planning CT segmentation. We will validate these methods on real patients in our clinical workflow. Besides, although these machine-learning tools are designed for radiotherapy of prostate cancer, they can also be easily extended to other new organs and new modalities after appropriate updating and training.",Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment,10003010,R01CA206100,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Hospital', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rectum', 'Sample Size', 'Shapes', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Update', 'Workload', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dosage', 'forest', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'novel', 'prostate radiotherapy', 'random forest', 'segmentation algorithm', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment duration', 'treatment planning']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,315338,0.0459081079975369
"Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement ABSTRACT This proposal aims to develop deep learning methods to automate the extraction of morphological imaging features relevant to knee osteoarthritis (OA), and total knee replacement. While, quantitative evaluation Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a central role in OA research in the clinical setting MR reports often tend to be subjective, qualitative, and the grading schemes utilized in epidemiological research are not used because they are extraordinarily time consuming and do not lend themselves to the demands of todays changing healthcare scenario. The “Big Data” challenge and opportunity facing us makes it necessary to build enabling tools (i) to automate the extraction of morphological OA imaging features, with the aim of evaluating disease progression prediction capabilities on larger sample sizes that have never been explored before; (ii) to discover latent patterns by uncovering unexplored data-driven imaging features by the application of state of the art deep learning approaches (1); (iii) combine multi-modality imaging with clinical, functional, activity, and other data to define the trajectory of joint degeneration in OA. Leveraging the power of these state of the art techniques, and with the extraordinary availability of a large datasets of annotated images; in this project, we propose to develop an automatic post-processing pipeline able to segment musculoskeletal tissues and identify morphological OA features in Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI), as defined by commonly used MRI grading systems. Automation of morphological grading of the tissues in the joint would be a significant breakthrough in both OA research and clinical practice. It would enable the analysis of large sample sizes, assist the radiologist/clinician in the grading of images, take a relatively short amount of time, reduce cost, and could potentially, improve classification models. The availability of automatic pipelines for the identification of morphological abnormities in MRI would drastically change clinical practice, and include semi-quantitative grades, rather than subjective impressions in radiology clinical reports. In this study, we also aim to develop a complete supervised deep learning approach to obtain data-driven representations as non-linear and semantic aggregation among elementary features able to exploit the latent information hidden in the complexity of a 3D MR images, eliminating the need for nominal grades of selected features. This second aim, while being at high risk has also a potential exceptional high impact; as it departs from the classical hypothesis driven studies, and builds a novel translational platform to revolutionize morphological grading of MR images in research studies, but also is paradigm-shifting in that it may provide a more quantitative feature driven basis for routine radiological clinical reports. The clinical impact of this proposal lies in the third aim (R33 phase), in which we propose to translate the solutions developed in the R61 phase on images in the UCSF clinical archives (PACS), and plan to include also demographic and clinical data in the electronic health records, to build the models defining total knee replacements. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deep learning is revolutionizing medical imaging by solving challenging problems in disease classification, progression and therapeutic response. In this project, we focus on using deep learning methodology on magnetic resonance images of the knee to study osteoarthritis prevalence, and progression. The usage of features derived from the imaging data, rather than established, and often subjective grading schemes, will have significant impact on clinical radiology, establishing quantitative physician assist tools with an ultimate goal of reducing the economic and healthcare burden of total knee replacement.",Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement,10193990,R33AR073552,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Big Data', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cartilage', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Models', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Economics', 'Edema', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Ligaments', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scheme', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Subchondral Cyst', 'Supervision', 'Synovitis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'automated segmentation', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'disease classification', 'drug discovery', 'epidemiology study', 'feature extraction', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'joint destruction', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'patient population', 'radiologist', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R33,2020,403748,0.025933589240235387
"Improved Techniques for Substitute CT Generation from MRI datasets This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET for PET/MR and target delineation for radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from only MR-data. Unfortunately, MRI has limited capability to resolve bone and the inability of most MR acquisitions to distinguish between air and bone makes segmentation of these tissues types challenging. This project will utilize deep learning, a new and growing area of machine learning, to develop new methodology to create substitute CT images from rapid MR acquisitions that can be utilized in PET/MR and radiation treatment planning workflows. In Aim 1 we will study rapid MR acquisitions to be used with deep learning approaches for sCT generation in the head and pelvis using 3T PET/MR images matched with PET/CT imaging to create deep learning training and evaluation datasets. Different deep learning networks and MR inputs will be studied and adapted to determine the best PET reconstruction performance. In Aim 2 we will investigate rapid but motion-resilient approaches to whole- body MR imaging for subsequent deep learning-based substitute CT generation. In an exploratory subaim, we also propose to study methods of sCT generation that only utilize PET-only data. The data acquired in Aim 2 will be used to create comprehensive whole-body, motion-resilient datasets for training and evaluation of deep learning networks. In Aim 3 we will evaluate substitute CT approaches for MR-only radiation treatment planning. MR-only approaches will be compared to standard CT-based treatment simulation in the brain, head & neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and deep learning networks will be optimized and evaluated for region- specific RT planning and simulation. Additionally, transfer learning approaches will be studied to extend sCT to a 0.35T MR-Linac to demonstrate respiratory motion resolved substitute CT generation. This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET in PET/MR and target delineation in radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from MR-only data.

"Developing Database and Software infrastructure for Quantitative Radiologic Analysis of Lumbar Radiculopathy Project Summary/Abstract Diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy (LR) currently relies on a qualitative interpretation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies and lacks standardization. This has led to inconsistent treatment and rising costs, while quality of life metrics have remained stagnant. To standardize the diagnosis of LR, the subjective and qualitative radiologic assessment needs to be augmented with accurate measurements of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas, two anatomical structures that are critical to the etiology of LR. However, precise measurements will require manual delineations of these regions on MRI. This is a tedious and time-consuming process that is not feasible on a daily, large-scale basis in the clinic. Deep Learning (DL) is a relatively new machine learning technique, which holds the promise of automating NF and CC segmentation. None the less, there remain several challenges to making DL-based segmentation routine in clinical practice. First, training and validating a DL model for segmentation of a given anatomical structure requires a large amount of expert annotated training data. Expert annotated data is expensive and time consuming to obtain, thus thwarting the development of quantitative imaging diagnostics for LR. To address this, we propose an expert-led manual delineation of NF and CC using de-identified MRI data extracted from UCLA's picture archiving and communications system (PACS). We expect the resulting database to contain data from over 35,000 lumbar MRI scans, with associated clinical history, demographics, and patient outcomes data. In a subset (1000) of these data, NFs and CCs will be annotated by multiple human expert raters. The consensus of these delineations will be used as ground truth segmentations to train, validate and improve our understanding of DL models. Secondly, as a part of this proposal, we aim to address several technical challenges that limit the deployment of automated image segmentation techniques to the clinic. Chief amongst these challenges is the failure of automated methodologies in the face of variation due to factors such as pathology, scanner protocol alterations, and general demographic variation. Additionally, our current understanding of DL does not allow us to categorically state the total number of expert annotated data that will be needed to train a model with a specified level of accuracy. Finally, we do not currently understand how selection of training cases for expert delineation affects generalization accuracy. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose experiments to define the relationship between DL algorithms and the cardinality of training data. We will also explore the use of unsupervised machine learning strategies, namely clustering and reinforcement learning, to understand how training data selection influences algorithmic accuracy. In summary, we propose to address data availability and technical knowledge gaps to the development of accurate DL-based techniques for automated NF and CC delineation, with a broader view to standardize the diagnosis and treatment of LR. Project Narrative Basing radiological diagnoses on a quantitative characterization of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas would greatly improve the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar radiculopathy (LR). Manual measurement of this anatomy on every clinical study is not feasible; however, deep learning- (DL) based automated methods can reliable perform this task if 1) expert annotations to train DL algorithms are available and 2) we can train DL models to work accurately despite image heterogeneity. We address these knowledge gaps by developing 1) a database containing spine MR images with expert annotation of NFs and CCs and 2) intelligent training data selection frameworks to train DL algorithms and assess their robustness to heterogeneity.",Developing Database and Software infrastructure for Quantitative Radiologic Analysis of Lumbar Radiculopathy,9928429,R21EB026665,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Categories', 'Central cord canal structure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Intelligence', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Investigative Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural History', 'Needs Assessment', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Radiculopathy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Diseases', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical database', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'experimental study', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'network architecture', 'neural network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'relational database', 'segmentation algorithm', 'software infrastructure', 'theories', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment optimization', 'unsupervised learning']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2020,195000,0.006121742826465222
"Robot-Assisted 3D ICE Catheter for Cardiac Ablation ABSTRACT  Although the cardiac ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation has a wide adoption rate, it also has a high recurrence of arrhythmia primarily due to the creation of suboptimal lesions. The procedure is also associated with complications including cardiac perforation, tamponade, atrio-esophageal fistulas and thrombus. Repeated and prolonged X-ray exposure for the clinician can also lead to enhanced risk of cancer. A fluoroless approach using intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is becoming a more widely adopted imaging option due to the absence of ionizing radiation and the possibility of real-time monitoring of the created lesions. However, the ICE- guided approach suffers from significant shortcomings, which include poor dexterity of the ICE catheter, difficulty in simultaneously manipulating the ICE and ablation catheters, unintuitive image orientation and noisy image quality. There is therefore an unmet need to overcome these shortcomings of the ICE-guided approach to enable better lesion creation and reduced complications associated with the cardiac ablation procedure. The long-term goal of this research is to develop robotic technologies, control and machine learning algorithms to enable ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. The objective is to develop a novel robotic manipulator, a steerable ICE catheter, and machine learning and control algorithms to manipulate the ICE catheter and monitor the created lesions in real-time. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that the robot-assisted steerable ICE catheter with the catheter tracking algorithms will enable simultaneous manipulation of the ICE and ablation catheters. Further, the machine learning algorithms to monitor therapy will reduce the risk of complications, while ensuring the creation of necrotic lesions, thereby reducing the recurrence of AF. In this proposal, we plan to pursue the following specific aims: 1) Design, develop, and model a steerable 3D ICE catheter with enhanced dexterity. 2) Design and develop a robotic manipulator and associated control algorithms to allow for precise manipulation of the ICE catheter. 3) Develop machine-learning and vision-based algorithms integrated with a navigation system for tracking the ablation catheter, and monitoring therapy. 4) Validate the robotic ICE system in heart phantom and porcine models. The proposed research is significant since it will allow for better therapeutic outcomes by reducing recurrence rates and complications associated with cardiac ablation, and avoiding exposure of the patient and clinical care team to X-ray radiation. The proposed research is innovative in that it builds on state-of-the-art robotics technology, machine learning and vision algorithms to enable fluoroless ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study addresses an important and under-investigated area of treating atrial fibrillation using a completely fluoroless approach with ICE imaging.

"Content-based MR-TRUS Fusion without Tracking There are about 3 million American men living with prostate cancer, the second leading cause of cancer death for men in the United States. If the prostate cancer is caught early before it spreads to other parts of the body, by active monitoring or treatment, most men will not die from it. Nevertheless, 22% to 47% of the patients with negative biopsies but elevated prostate-specific antigen levels may still harbor malignant tumors, which can be life threatening and could have been missed by the commonly used ultrasound guided random biopsy. By contrast, fusion of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) for guiding targeted biopsies has shown to significantly improve the cancer detection rate. However, MR-TRUS fusion itself is very challenging due to the difficulties in directly registering images of these two very different modalities in different dimensions. To bypass the difficult registration problems, the existing fusion techniques require the use of specialized expensive and cumbersome hardware tracking devices, which increases cost and elongates procedures. More importantly, due to a number of factors such as patient movement, respiratory motion and ultrasound transducer pressure change, prostate motion can happen during a procedure and cause the images to be misaligned. Timely noticing and correcting such motion require great skill and knowledge of radiological imaging, where studies show a steep learning curve for mastering fusion systems. Failing in image registration and motion compensation renders the fusion guided biopsy performing no differently than random biopsy. To address the fundamental cause of the problems, the goal of this project is to create enabling technology of MR- TRUS image fusion solely based on internal image content without using external tracking devices. The proposed research is foundational for developing next generation of MR-TRUS fusion guidance systems for prostate biopsy to achieve robust performance with lower costs. Recent advancement in machine learning, especially deep learning, has provided us new tools and new angles to tackle this challenging problem. This project aims for directly fusing 2D TRUS frames with 3D MR volume by developing novel deep learning methods for image reconstruction and registration. The proposed methods are designed to exploit both population and patient specific imaging information to accurately align images. As all learning-based image registration methods try to better use population knowledge to improve the registration performance, few of them have been able to efficiently use patient specific information, which can be essential to obtain robust and accurate performance. Upon successful completion, the innovation created from the project will disrupt the common perception that hardware tracking has to be used for multimodal image fusion-guided interventions and alleviate the demand on physicians’ experience and skill in image analysis and fusion to help obtain consistent results. This project will lead to the development of novel prostate biopsy systems and will also impact a range of other image fusion based interventional guidance technologies.

"Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking PROJECT SUMMARY  Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures tissue parameters such as T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion to detect subtle differences in tissue states (such as microstructure, diffuse fibrosis, edema, hemorrhage, and iron content) from neurological, oncological, and cardiovascular diseases. Because each parameter offers complementary tissue information, multiparameter mapping is very promising for risk assessment, early detection, accurate staging, and treatment monitoring of disease. However, quantitative MRI is typically very time consuming and difficult to perform. Each parameter is typically measured from its own series of images, so measuring multiple parameters leads to long, inefficient scanning sessions. Furthermore, cardiac and breathing motion creates misalignment between images, causing additional problems.  The standard approach to motion is to either remove it (e.g., ask the patient to hold their breath) or to synchronize image acquisition with it (e.g., using electrocardiography (ECG) to monitor cardiac motion). This approach makes scan times even longer, limits imaging to patients who can repeatedly perform long breath holds (which is difficult for aging or weak patients) and who have predictable cardiac motion (which is not true of patients with cardiac arrhythmias). Furthermore, these methods are often unreliable and difficult to perform.  This project is to develop and validate a new technology, MR Multitasking, to perform multiple simultaneous measurements in a single, push-button scan that is both comfortable for patients and simple for technologists to perform. MR Multitasking redesigns quantitative MRI around the concept of images as functions of many time dimensions, each corresponding to a different dynamic process (e.g., motion, T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion), and then uses mathematical models called low-rank tensors to perform fast, multidimensional imaging. This allows continuous acquisition of imaging data even while the subject is moving, providing motion-resolved parameter maps without breath holding or motion synchronization. We will scan healthy subjects, liver patients, prostate cancer patients, and cardiovascular patients to develop and validate this technology and use artificial intelligence to quickly reconstruct images from the collected data. The resulting tool will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to answer a wide range of biomedical questions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project is to develop and validate a one-stop, push-button solution for comprehensive, motion- resolved quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This will be accomplished by cultivating a new technology, MR Multitasking, which can measure multiple tissue biomarkers in a single scan, even in moving organs. The resulting technology will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to diagnose, monitor, and study a wide range of diseases.","Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking",9886248,R01EB028146,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Fibrosis', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Iron', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'body system', 'deep learning', 'heart motion', 'image reconstruction', 'magnetic field', 'magnetohydrodynamic', 'mathematical model', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'time use', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,628575,0.054593840177523494
"Machine Learning and Deformable Model-based 4D Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony from MRI Summary/Abstract In the presence of diseases such as ischemic heart disease (IHD), cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. However, while imaging methods such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) can provide high quality images of the moving heart, conventional clinical quantitative analysis of cardiac function is largely limited to global function analysis of the left ventricle (LV), with only qualitative and subjective characterization of regional function. An obstacle to better quantification of regional function is the complex 3D structure and motion of the heart wall, which has typically necessitated time-consuming user-guided processing of the images to carry out the associated 3D-motion analysis.  Recent advances in machine-learning (ML) approaches for image analysis are promising as new means to speed up the processing of cardiac images, as well as to analyze the underlying regional motion patterns. However, current Deep ML (DML) approaches to image analysis largely function as “black boxes”, without clear indications of which features contribute most to the analysis results, thus limiting their clinical utility. In the initial funded period of this research project, we have been developing integrated approaches to the segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and analysis of CMR data, with application to the evaluation of cardiac dyssynchrony. Today, treatment of dyssynchrony in HF with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) leads to improvement in only ~2/3 patients selected with conventional criteria (usually by electrocardiogram [ECG]). Our initial results show encouraging results of correlation between MRI evaluation of dyssynchrony and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) outcomes. In the new proposed research, we will further develop these methods, with the goal of automating the cardiac analysis methods. This will include the introduction of new ML-based methods, which will incorporate information on the specific cardiac motion factors that lead to classification of different disease states in dyssynchrony. Our Hypothesis is that by using these new ML-based methods for cardiac motion analysis, we will discover and evaluate significant quantitative correlations between different cardiac dyssynchrony motion patterns and CRT outcomes. Also, late-gadolinium enhancement (LGE) provides images for infarction visualization. Incorporation of tissue characterization into the motion-pattern analysis could lead to increased understanding of how infarcted areas affect regional motion in concert with dyssynchrony. The unearthing of these findings will allow us to validate them in future clinical studies. The project will also disseminate our novel, coupled DML and model-based methodology for quantifying and classifying cardiac motion in diseases affecting regional wall motion. Other research groups can then apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases affecting LV motion. Project Narrative A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), as the current clinical selection criteria do not take into account regional cardiac function. We will develop improved methods for 4D-analysis and -visualization of both global and regional cardiac function from cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) data, including novel deep learning methods that will provide additional information on the salient features that contribute most to characterization of cardiac dyssynchrony. These new methods will be applied to the analysis of CMR data from both a stratified sample of normal subjects and patients with cardiac dyssynchrony (with and without infarction), with correlation with therapeutic results following CRT, potentially leading to improved clinical guidelines and clinical outcomes, as well as increased understanding of cardiac physiology and pathophysiology.",Machine Learning and Deformable Model-based 4D Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony from MRI,10052934,R01HL127661,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Infarction', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pump', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Selection Criteria', 'Speed', 'Sweden', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Visualization', 'Width', 'base', 'cardiac resynchronization therapy', 'deep learning', 'effective therapy', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2020,763531,0.044950306208106125
"Non-invasive Evaluation of Intracranial Atherosclerotic Disease Using Hemodynamic Biomarkers The proposed study will be based on a multimodal approach using 4D flow MRI, perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI), diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) and high-resolution vessel wall imaging (VWI) together with patient information (demographics and clinical factors) to predict the risk of recurrent stroke of patients with intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) stenosis. This will allow integrating the vulnerability of the stenosis as well as the patient by assessing the hemodynamic impact, plaque stability, and stroke lesion pattern together with patient information into a prediction model. PWI will provide tissue perfusion, VWI will provide plaque stability, DWI will provide stroke lesion pattern and 4D flow MRI will provide macroscopic hemodynamics of the circle of Willis (CoW). We will concentrate on the following innovative developments: 4D flow MRI: In order to allow 4D flow MRI scanning with a high dynamic velocity range (necessary to measure slow and fast velocities simultaneously), we recently developed dual-venc 4D flow MRI. However, this method suffers from extended scan tome of an already long acquisition. We, therefore, aim to minimize scan time for dual-venc 4D flow MRI scan while using the required spatial resolution and volume coverage, targeting 5-10 minutes so that this sequence can be added to clinical protocols. We aim to achieve this by integrating compressed sensing acceleration. Rigorous testing of the sequence will be done in phantom experiments as well as in a healthy test-retest control study. Data Analysis and Outcome Prediction: Currently, the multi-modal information that can be acquired with MRI has not been combined and used for comprehensive prediction of recurrent stroke risk in ICAD. Information that can be acquired from different MRI modalities may be critical in characterizing ICAD patient status. We will develop a new analysis tool that combines all data into a single network graph. All imaging data will be reported relative to supplying the intracranial artery of the CoW by using the vascular territory region of interest analysis. This will allow gathering all imaging parameters in a network graph. In a cross-sectional patient study, we will use combined data to see if it enables differentiation between healthy subjects, ICAD subgroups. Patient Study: In Aim 3, we will develop a machine-learning algorithm to predict which of the patients are at risk of experiencing a recurrent stroke. In order to achieve this, we will enroll a total of 150 ICAD patients from two institutions (Northwestern Memorial Hospital and San Francisco General Hospital). The combined data from the four different MR modalities and all other patient information will be used to identify only the discriminative features. This will be realized by using support vector machine recursive feature elimination to rank features associated with the risk of an ischemic event. The SVM will be trained and tested using information from the patient's clinical follow-up as outcome measure. The outcome (ischemic event or death yes/no)) will enable the development of the SVM classifier to predict outcome. Project Narrative (2 – 3 sentences) In the proposed study, we will develop an advanced intracranial MRI protocol together with a comprehensive image processing pipeline allowing full characterization of intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD). Imaging biomarkers together with clinical and demographic factors will enable the identification of patients at risk to suffer recurring stroke. Machine learning methods will be used to predict risk. Successful completion will allow for better identification of patients who could benefit from endovascular stenting to reduce stroke recurrence.",Non-invasive Evaluation of Intracranial Atherosclerotic Disease Using Hemodynamic Biomarkers,10052508,R01HL149787,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Acceleration', 'Acute', 'Age', 'Angioplasty', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain Infarction', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Circle of Willis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Control Groups', 'Core-Binding Factor', 'Coupled', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Death Rate', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drops', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Flowmeters', 'Gender', 'General Hospitals', 'Graph', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Arterial Stenosis', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Perfusion Weighted MRI', 'Pilot Projects', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recurrence', 'Refractory', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'San Francisco', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Staging', 'Stenosis', 'Stents', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'cerebrovascular', 'comorbidity', 'demographics', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'hypoperfusion', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'intracranial artery', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'pressure sensor', 'prognostic significance', 'stroke patient', 'stroke risk', 'supervised learning', 'support vector machine', 'tool']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,486172,-0.07649741974227371
"Data-driven Head Motion Correction in PET Imaging Using Deep Learning Project Summary Positron-emission tomography (PET) is an imaging modality that allows clinicians and researchers to study the physiological or pathological processes of the human body, and in particular the brain via the use of specific tracers. For brain PET imaging, patient head movement during scanning presents a challenge for accurate PET image reconstruction and subsequent quantitative analysis. Problems due to head motion are exacerbated by the long duration of the scans, with scan times commonly over one hour. Furthermore, some PET studies specifically involve subjects that either have trouble staying still due to psychological variations, e.g. patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, or psychological variations, e.g. subjects with anxiety disorders, or are required to participate in tasks that involve movement, e.g. smoking cigarettes while scanning. In brain scans, the average head motion can vary from 7 mm in clinical scans to triple this amount for longer research scans. Quantitatively, a 5 mm head motion can produce biases of up to ~35% in regional intensities and ∼15% in volume of distribution estimates, which could much larger than the difference observed in regional intensities or binding potential that distinguish different demographic groups being studied. The ability to track and correct head motion, therefore, would be of high utility in both clinical and research PET studies. In the past, many motion correction methods have been proposed. However, except for hardware-based approaches, there has been no method that can track frequent head motion on-the-fly during the PET acquisition. Hardware-based approaches are not readily available for clinical translation or used by other research facilities due to highly-customized software/hardware setup. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a data-driven methodology using deep learning to track and estimate rigid head motion using PET raw data, and incorporate both tracer type and time as conditional variables into this deep neural network design in order to handle diverse PET tracer types and their dynamic behavior. Overall, these solutions will provide for a data-driven motion estimation methodology to improve the quality of PET imaging. Specifically, we will start with the development and testing of our methodology for rigid head motion estimation using single-tracer PET raw data. Then we will perform evaluation of our multi-tracer motion estimation methodology applied to real PET data with a diverse range of tracers. Finally, in the exploratory phase, we will integrate time-of-flight information into deep learning-based motion prediction. The significance of this proposal is that it will allow for improved quality of PET imaging in real time and potentially allow for its use in clinical PET systems that do not have special motion tracking hardware. This work will serve as a first step towards developing data-driven motion estimation algorithms for full body PET imaging. The innovation lies in the development of what is a data-driven solution to the problem of real time motion estimation. Project Narrative Positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging of the brain is a highly useful tool for biomedical research and clinical practice. Head motion during scanning degrades PET image quality and introduces image artifacts. We propose to develop new data-driven methods, based on PET raw data, to estimate head motion using deep learning, which can be used for real time motion estimation in PET imaging.",Data-driven Head Motion Correction in PET Imaging Using Deep Learning,9877261,R21EB028954,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain scan', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology)', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological Processes', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Smoking', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neural network', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'reconstruction', 'research facility', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIBIB,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,243150,0.07337821811850904
"Quantitative MR Imaging of Vascular Factors in Parkinsons Disease Abstract Vascular health has been shown to be an important factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Hence, the ability to measure reliably and quantitatively early hemodynamic changes in the aging brain can be a powerful tool for diagnosing, studying, and developing treatments. Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging can yield quantitative perfusion images without the use of contrast agents. We propose that combining new ASL techniques, such as Velocity Selective Inversion (VSI) labeling pulses and magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) with deep learning regression methods will allow quantification of multiple hemodynamic parameters beyond perfusion, thus providing a much more nuanced picture of the state of the vasculature. We also expect that the new technique will offer dramatic improvements in SNR, specificity and sensitivity of ASL, and that the proposed techniques will have many other applications in research and in the clinic. We propose to use these techniques to fill the knowledge gap regarding the relationship between vascular changes and Parkinson’s disease and its symptoms, particularly fatigue, whose pathogenesis is not well understood. If we are successful in this application, future work will use the hemodynamic parameters of interest as biomarkers to assess risk of neurodegeneration, determine therapeutic targets, and guide in the development of new therapies. Public Health Statement Vascular health is an important factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases We propose to develop a method that can produce quantifiable images of multiple blood flow related parameters with a single scan and without the use of contrast injections. We will use this method to gain a better understanding of the relationship between Parkinson’s disease and cerebral blood flow, and expect that our method will have multiple applications beside Parkinson’s disease.",Quantitative MR Imaging of Vascular Factors in Parkinsons Disease,9968566,R01NS112233,"['Address', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Arteries', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Brain', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Fatigue', 'Fingerprint', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human Volunteers', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Injections', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Noise', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Spin Labels', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'aging brain', 'deep learning', 'feeding', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging biomarker', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural network', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'perfusion imaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'vascular factor', 'vector', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,348762,0.003023503628236872
"Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT PROJECT SUMMARY Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before heart attacks occur and is currently used to predict risk in millions of patients annually. Under the current grant, we have established a unique collaborative multicenter registry including over 23,000 imaging datasets (REFINE SPECT) with both prognostic (major adverse cardiovascular events) and diagnostic (invasive catheterization) outcomes. Using this registry, we have demonstrated that a combination of MPS image analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) tools achieved superior predictive performance compared to visual assessment by experienced readers or current state-of-the-art quantitative techniques. In the renewal, we plan to expand REFINE SPECT with now-available enhanced datasets (adding CT and myocardial blood flow information) and leverage latest AI advances to provide a personalized decision support tool for patient-specific cardiovascular risk assessment and estimation of benefit from revascularization following MPS. The overall aim is to optimize the clinical capabilities of MPS in risk prediction and treatment guidance by integrating all available imaging and clinical data with state-of-the-art AI methods. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: (1) To expand and enhance our REFINE SPECT registry including CT and MPS flow data, (2) To develop fully automated techniques for all MPS and CT image analysis, (3) To apply explainable deep learning time-to-event AI models for optimal prediction of MACE and benefit from revascularization from all image and clinical data. This work will result in an immediately deployable clinical tool, which will optimally predict risk of adverse events and establish the relative benefits from specific therapies, beyond what is possible by subjective visual analysis and mental integration of all imaging (MPS, CT, flow), and clinical data by physicians. Such quantitative integrative methods are not yet available, leaving the current practice for assessing risk and recommending therapy highly subjective. The precise quantitative results will be presented to clinicians in easy to understand terms (e.g., % risk per year, or relative risk of one therapy vs. the alternative) for a specific patient. Additionally, our methods to make AI conclusions more tangible will improve adoption of this technology. All results will be derived fully automatically thus eliminating any variability. Our approach will fit into current MPS practice and will be immediately translatable to clinics worldwide. Most importantly, this research will allow patients to benefit from increased precision and accuracy in risk assessment, thereby optimizing the use of imaging in guiding patient management decisions and ultimately improving outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myocardial perfusion imaging with SPECT is often used to predict who is at risk of heart attack and should undergo treatment such as coronary bypass or stenting; however, physicians read images visually and report results with wide variability. With the latest artificial intelligence tools and new types of imaging (including CT and fast SPECT scans), the investigators propose to develop and validate an automated clinical tool to optimize risk prediction and objectively establish the relative benefit of a specific therapy. This new tool will consider all available patient images and other relevant information to provide a personalized explanation and precise calculation of risk and potential benefits from therapy for each patient.",Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT,9888240,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Calcium', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catheterization', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Country', 'Cox Models', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Event', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Injections', 'International', 'Joints', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Stents', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adverse event risk', 'attenuation', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'personalized decision', 'prognostic', 'radiotracer', 'relating to nervous system', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'support tools', 'time use', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,808131,0.023636656524136598
"Machine learning for fast motion compensated quantitative abdominal DCE-MRI Project Summary: Functional imaging with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) provides important physiological markers of permeability, perfusion and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), a measure of kidney function, without exposing patients to ionizing radiation. DCE-MR images are at the same time used for evaluation of anatomy. Functional markers from DCE-MRI, if computed accurately, would play a critical role in diagnosing and assessing the progression of a number of pediatric diseases including those compromising kidney function, liver diseases, tumors, and Crohn's disease. One of the most important applications of DCE-MRI is assessing kidney function (GFR) in hydronephrosis patients with obstruction. In the absence of GFR information, children who stand to benefit from immediate surgical reconstruction might be overlooked or delayed in receiving treatment, and those who might benefit from a more conservative approach (i.e., “watchful waiting”) might receive an unnecessary surgical intervention. While the current reference standard, nuclear renography (MAG3), yields some useful diagnostic information, it is slow, provides low resolution, does not offer anatomic detail, and delivers potentially harmful ionizing radiation. There is a clinical need for accurate computation of quantitative functional markers. Unfortunately, current methods of DCE-MRI in neonates and children are less than optimal, and therefore, DCE-MRI is underutilized in clinical practice. The technical challenges include insufficient temporal resolution to capture fast arterial input function (AIF) dynamics (which are required for accurate computation of quantitative markers), unavoidable respiratory motion and bulk motion (which reduce image quality and significantly lower the accuracy of parameter estimates), and a lack of robust, fast, automated post processing techniques for accurate computation of markers. Thus, there is an urgent, unmet need to develop a motion-compensated, high spatiotemporal resolution DCE-MRI method addressing these challenges. The primary objective of this exploratory, three-year study, is three-fold: first, to develop and evaluate a new bulk and respiratory motion-compensated, high spatiotemporal resolution DCE-MRI technique for accurate estimation of functional markers; second, to further improve the robustness and speed of DCE-MRI using a fast, deep learning (DL) technique with integrated temporal prior for the reconstruction of motion-compensated, higher quality, high temporal resolution images; and third, to develop an automatic quantitative analysis pipeline including segmentation and tracer kinetic model-fitting using DL techniques for fast, robust and accurate quantification of functional markers. The successful completion of these aims will provide new, clinically important abdominal imaging capabilities, with real-time, motion-compensated image reconstruction and reliable real-time parameter estimation from high temporal and spatial resolution DCE-MRI. This work will extend the usefulness of DCE-MRI to pediatric patients who are unable to remain still in the scanner, and eliminate the need for repeated scans and sedation in infants. ! !

"Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques PROJECT SUMMARY Symptomatic urinary stone disease (USD) affects >8% of the United States population, resulting in an estimated annual medical cost exceeding $10 billion. Computed tomography (CT) is the established method for imaging urinary calculi and can provide accurate sub-millimeter details of the size and location of renal stones. However, in vivo characterization of more than just size and location is critical for quantifying stone characteristics important for optimal patient health management and essential for clinical research. A complete characterization of renal stones, including stone composition and fragility, is needed for safe and cost effective management of USD, as well as for phenotyping of research subjects. Our proposal meets these needs by developing methods to accurately and non-invasively characterize stones using low-dose, multi-energy CT. Our long-term goal is to use advanced CT methodologies to characterize urinary calculi for the purpose of directing clinical treatment and facilitating clinical investigation. Our objectives in this application are to develop and validate in vivo quantitative techniques for characterizing mixed and non-uric-acid stone types, as well as for predicting the likelihood of successful stone comminution, a novel concept we refer to as stone fragility. These image-based stone biometrics will enable evidence-based identification of treatment strategies that maximize effectiveness while minimizing risk, as well as accurate and non-invasive classification of research subjects to accelerate scientific advances in the understanding and treatment of USD. We will meet these objectives by accomplishing the following specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Develop and validate CT techniques to characterize mixed and non-uric-acid  stone types.  Specific Aim 2: Develop and validate CT techniques to predict stone fragility. Current state-of-the-art stone imaging technology cannot accurately identify the composition of mixed and non- uric-acid stone types, nor can it provide quantitative indications of the likelihood of efficient comminution using the lowest risk technique. The innovation of this proposal lies in the use of newly developed statistical, deep learning and texture analysis techniques to quantitatively describe essential characteristics of urinary calculi, namely composition and fragility. The significance of this proposal is that the knowledge derived from using such techniques represents unique quantitative biomarkers that will allow physicians and researchers to more effectively manage and study USD.

"Development of a prototype software for automated PET/CT interpretation and reporting in thoracic cancer Abstract. In cancer, body-wide FDG-PET/CT is a prime modality for diagnosis, staging, and treatment assessment. Despite its paramount importance to enable precision medicine in cancer, no method is currently available for automated disease burden estimation and standardized reporting on PET/CT images regionally and globally in anatomic organs and lymph node zones within a body region or body-wide. Automated production- mode body-wide/ body-region-wide disease measurement with standardized reporting will foster cancer research discovery and will be of great interest to oncologists, radiologists/ nuclear medicine physicians, Medicare and private health insurers, and pharmaceutical companies that conduct clinical trials of new cancer therapeutics and currently rely on manual methods of response assessment. The overarching goal of this Phase I project is, therefore, to develop, validate, and demonstrate a prototype software for disease measurement and reporting via FDG-PET/CT in the above manner in one body region, namely thorax, based on innovative algorithms that are generalizable body-wide. The project has two aims: Aim 1: Develop, implement, and validate algorithms for disease burden estimation in thoracic cancer via FDG-PET/CT. Aim 2: Develop and demonstrate a prototype software implementing the above algorithms for disease measurement and reporting. Aim 1 will be accomplished in 3 stages: Tasks 1, 2: PET/CT image data sets which are radiologically near normal for the thoracic body region will be gathered from existing whole-body scans of 100 patients. In these data sets, 7 key anatomic organs and 5 key lymph node zones in the thorax will be delineated under expert guidance. These data will be used to build population fuzzy anatomy models following our established Automatic Anatomy Recognition (AAR) methodology. An additional 100 whole-body PET/CT scans of patients with different types of cancer will be gathered to test our methods. Using available commercial clinical software, the PET uptake properties of lesions in organs and diseased lymph nodes in lymph node zones will be measured manually and used as reference ground truth of disease burden. Task 3: Deep learning (DL) algorithms anatomically guided by AAR will be developed to very accurately localize (but not delineate) organs and lymph node zones in PET/CT images using the models. Task 4: Novel methods based on fuzzy principles will be developed to automatically tag and quantify pathological regions (without explicitly delineating them) within located organs and nodal zones, and the accuracy of disease measurement will be evaluated (Task 5). Aim 2 will be accomplished by incorporating the disease measurement methodology into a prototype software named AAR-DQ (Tasks 6, 7) based on our earlier software platform CAVASS. AAR-DQ will report disease burden in a hierarchical manner – (i) at the body-region level; (ii) at each organ/ lymph node zone level; (ii) at each lesion/ lymph node level. Expected milestones. Aim 1: AAR-DQ disease measurement not to deviate more than 10% from clinical ground truth measurement. Aim 2: Disease measurement/ reporting in under 5 minutes per patient PET/CT study. Automated production-mode body-wide/ body-region-wide disease measurement has numerous potential applications in cancer and other diseases and has considerable commercial potential. The overarching goal of this Phase I STTR project is to develop, validate, and demonstrate a prototype software for disease measurement and reporting via FDG-PET/CT in the above manner in one body region, namely thorax, based on innovative algorithms that are generalizable body-wide.",Development of a prototype software for automated PET/CT interpretation and reporting in thoracic cancer,10076938,R41CA236492,"['Abbreviations', 'Abdomen', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Body Burden', 'Body Regions', 'Cancer Patient', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Fostering', 'Geography', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thorax', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicare', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Nodal', 'Normalcy', 'Oncologist', 'Organ', 'PET/CT scan', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Privatization', 'Production', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scanning', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithm training', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer type', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'evidence based guidelines', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'lymph nodes', 'lymphoid organ', 'model building', 'novel', 'object recognition', 'outcome forecast', 'payment', 'precision medicine', 'prototype', 'radiologist', 'response', 'software development', 'treatment response', 'uptake', 'whole body imaging']",NCI,"QUANTITATIVE RADIOLOGY SOLUTIONS, LLC",R41,2020,252131,0.01856566741423407
"Optimization of diagnostic accuracy, radiation dose, and patient throughput for cardiac SPECT via advanced and clinically practical cardiac-respiratory motion correction and deep learning Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is widely used to detect and evaluate coronary artery disease. The goal of this project is to reduce the radiation dose and/or scan time of SPECT MPI by a combined factor of 16x, while maintaining or increasing diagnostic accuracy. This would enable SPECT MPI to be performed, e.g., with 4x reduced radiation dose and 4x shorter scan time (~2.5 minutes) than typical protocols. Radiation dose in SPECT MPI has been recognized as an important issue, accounting for ~25% of all radiation exposure to patients in medical imaging. Dose reduction particularly addresses the increased prevalence of obese patients (who receive higher dose) and younger cardiac patients (whose radiation risk is higher due to longer life expectancy). Reduction in scan time would improve comfort for elderly and infirm cardiac patients, while mitigating body-motion image artifacts and reducing healthcare costs by increasing clinical throughput. We will reduce dose and scan time through innovative image reconstruction methods that involve little or no cost and require no additional patient setup steps. We will employ new respiratory and cardiac motion compensation to reduce image artifacts, as well as new deep learning techniques, which will be used for both respiratory-signal estimation and high-performance denoising. We will methodically optimize these techniques and then validate our algorithms in multicenter clinical reader studies. SA1: Develop clinically practical respiratory motion surrogates for low-count studies. T1: Perfect data- driven respiratory surrogate estimation; T2: Optimize data-driven surrogate estimation at reduced counts; T3: Develop and clinically validate depth-sensing cameras for respiratory and body-motion surrogate estimation; T4: Generalization of data-driven surrogate estimation to SPECT systems not having a CT. SA2: Develop deep-learning reconstruction methods and optimize for diagnostic accuracy and dose/scan time. T1: Post-reconstruction DL denoising algorithms for 3D perfusion images for reduced-count and standard- count studies; T2: DL denoising algorithms for 4D cardiac-gated studies; T3: 4D reconstruction with embedded DL denoising, cardiac motion estimation and correction; and T4: DL reconstruction methods with both RMC and CMC, with projection data binned using respiratory surrogate signals derived in SA1. SA3: Perform multicenter clinical reader studies (6 clinicians, 3 institutions) to validate the new algorithms and compare to current clinically-available methods based on diagnostic performance and repeatability in assessing both perfusion and wall motion defects. T1: In comparison to baseline clinical reconstruction, evaluate added benefit of: a) including attenuation and scatter correction, and b) additionally including RMC; T2: Validate DL for improvement of perfusion and function (wall motion) task performance at full-count levels; and T3: Validate DL for improvement of task performance at reduced counts. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project we will employ new methods of image reconstruction and processing to reduce radiation dose and scan time in cardiac SPECT imaging, which is used 15-20 million times per year to evaluate coronary artery disease. Dose reduction is important because cardiac SPECT accounts for ~25% of all radiation exposure to the public due to medical imaging; reducing scan time would make SPECT more comfortable for elderly and infirm cardiac patients, while mitigating image artifacts, as well as and reducing healthcare costs by allowing more patients to be scanned per day. Our goal will be to achieve a combined 16x reduction in dose and scan time while maintaining or improving diagnostic accuracy, thereby permitting a 4x reduction in dose while reducing scan time from ~10 minutes to ~2.5 minutes.","Optimization of diagnostic accuracy, radiation dose, and patient throughput for cardiac SPECT via advanced and clinically practical cardiac-respiratory motion correction and deep learning",10072432,R01HL154687,"['3-Dimensional', '4D Imaging', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Advocate', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Cardiac', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Exposure to', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Institution', 'Left Ventricular Function', 'Life Expectancy', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'denoising deep learning', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'heart motion', 'hemodynamics', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'perfusion imaging', 'preservation', 'prognostic', 'quantum', 'radiation risk', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'tool', 'visual tracking']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,786840,0.05767968660045126
"Machine learning accelerated on-line adaptive replanning Abstract. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop and test a novel machine learning (ML) accelerated On-Line Adaptive Replanning (MOLAR) solution for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided radiation therapy (RT) (MRgRT). During the multi-fraction RT process, the location, shape and size of tumors and normal organs vary significantly between the fractions. These interfraction variations are among the major factors that can limit the accuracy of RT targeting. The current standard practice of image-guided RT (IGRT), developed to address the interfraction variations based on cone-beam CT (CBCT), can only correct for translational errors, and thus does not fully account for interfraction changes. To address this issue, researchers recently introduced online adaptive replanning (OLAR) that generates a new plan based on the anatomy of the day and delivers the plan for the fraction. Currently, two main obstacles affect the success of OLAR: (1) the anatomy of the day cannot be delineated accurately based on CBCT, and (2) the time required to perform OLAR is long enough to render it impractical. One way to improve the delineation accuracy is to use MRI versus CT. MRI-guided OLAR is currently being introduced into the clinics to substantially improve RT targeting. However, the bottleneck is still the impractical length of time required to segment the anatomy of the day, which can exceed 30 minutes. Furthermore, available synthetic CT (sCT) generation methods are slow or inaccurate for MRI-guided OLAR. There is no method available to quickly and objective determine when OLAR is necessary. To address these issues, we plan to develop novel techniques in the MOLAR solution. We hypothesize that the MRI-based MOLAR solution will fully account for interfraction changes, thereby substantially improving tumor targeting during RT delivery and the effectiveness of RT. Specifically, we aim to (1) develop practical ML-based solutions to quickly determine the necessity of OLAR and to rapidly generate accurate synthetic CTs; (2) develop ML-based techniques to substantially accelerate segmentation for OLAR using a progressive three-step process; and (3) verify clinical practicality and effectiveness of MOLAR by retrospectively and prospectively applying the MOLAR on MRI sets to test its speed and effectiveness in accounting for interfraction variations. We will develop this novel MOLAR solution by forging unique collaborations between clinical physicists, radiation oncologists and industry developers via an established academic-industry partnership. The successful completion of this project will enable clinicians to routinely practice “image-plan-treat”, which is the optimal solution for MRgRT. This new paradigm will fully account for interfraction variations, improve tumor targeting, reduce normal tissue toxicity, and ultimately encourage clinicians to revise the current doses and/or dose fractionations to increase therapeutic gain, enhance patient quality of life, and/or substantially save on healthcare costs. Our proposed strategy represents a drastic departure from current practice. We firmly believe that this strategy is the future of RT delivery. Project Narrative: This R01 application proposes to develop and test a novel machine learning accelerated online adaptive replanning (MOLAR) solution for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided adaptive radiation therapy through a unique academic and industry partnership. The MOLAR solution aims to fully account for interfraction variations, thereby substantially improving the accuracy and effectiveness of radiation therapy (RT) for cancer.

"2021 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging SUMMARY This application requests funding to support the 2021 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging, a three- day meeting to be held from February 25-27, 2021, which will be the seventh of its kind hosted by the University of Pennsylvania. The requested funds will primarily be used to cover travel and lodging for junior researchers who will be presenting at the workshop: undergraduate, graduate and junior faculty. Some funds may also be allocated to help pay for live webcasting and publication costs related to workshop materials. As with previous meetings, we intend to stream each session of the meeting in real-time, allowing those who are interested in the proceedings but unable to attend in person to access them online for free. As mortalities associated with pulmonary disease continue to rise worldwide, innovative imaging techniques capable of both diagnosing and helping to treat these pathologies are becoming an increasingly important. As a field, pulmonary imaging currently encompasses a wider range of techniques for the structural, functional and molecular assessment of lung disorders than at any time in its history. What is more, these techniques are being developed and optimized by researchers across an increasingly diverse set of fields such as biology, chemistry, physics, engineering, computer science and medicine. Given the field's rapidly-evolving nature, the existence of a regular forum in which scientists and clinicians can communicate their ideas with each other is of the utmost importance. Given the absence of other scientific meetings with a similarly focused agenda, our previous workshops have succeeded in providing just such a forum—allowing a diverse group of pulmonary imaging researchers to come together for the kind of rigorous, collaborative exchange that can continue to advance the field. The specific aims of the proposed workshop are as follows: (1) host a one-day workshop on pulmonary inflammation; (2) inform the pulmonary imaging community of the latest advances in structural, functional and molecular lung imaging; (3) explore the use of pulmonary imaging to evaluate therapeutic response, the inherent obstacles to doing so, and strategies to overcome them; (4) investigate new approaches for integrating deep learning and pulmonary imaging techniques to more accurately diagnose and phenotype disease and predict injury progression; (5) broadcast the entire workshop live online, thereby enabling interested parties not in attendance to access the proceedings in real-time, free of charge. Based on the uniformly positive feedback in response to our one-day boot camp on pulmonary physiology prior to the 2019 workshop, we intend to hold another boot camp before the 2021 meeting, this time focused on pulmonary inflammation. This boot camp will consist of ~5 longer presentations (approximately 1 hour each) on topics related to this central theme, with significant time devoted to question and answer after each, and a final discussion panel aimed at synthesizing the most important issues covered over the course of the day. In addition to this exciting addition to the format, the 2021 workshop will again seek a more equitable balance between functional, structural and molecular imaging approaches to pulmonary disease across the invited talks, while also continuing to expand our recent focus on the topics of imaging assessments of treatment response and the integration of imaging techniques with machine learning. Finally, the 2021 workshop add a session on bridging the gap between current clinical practice and innovative imaging technologies. NARRATIVE This application requests funding to support the 2021 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging at the University of Pennsylvania. This recurring workshop provides a necessary and valuable opportunity for researchers working in the fields of functional, structural, and molecular imaging technique development for assessing lung diseases such as lung cancer, COPD, IPF and ARDS to come together in order to discuss and share their work.

"Imaging and Dosimetry of Yttrium-90 for Personalized Cancer Treatment Abstract Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with preferential delivery of 90Y microspheres to target lesions has shown promising response rates with limited toxicity in the treatment of hepatocellular (HCC), the second leading cause of cancer death in the world. However, to achieve more durable responses, there is much room to improve/adapt the treatment to ensure that all lesions and lesion sub-regions receive adequate radiation delivery. While externally delivered stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is well suited for smaller solitary HCC, its application for larger or multifocal disease is challenged by the radiation tolerance of the normal liver parenchyma. A dosimetry guided combined approach that exploits complementary advantages of internal and external radiation delivery can be expected to improve treatment of HCC. To make this transition, however, prospective clinical trials establishing safety are needed. Furthermore, for routine clinic use, accurate and fast voxel-level dose estimation in internal radionuclide therapy, that lags behind external beam therapy dosimetry, is still needed. Our long-term goal is to improve the efficacy of radiation therapy with personalized dosimetry guided treatment. Our objective in this application is to demonstrate that it is possible to use 90Y imaging based absorbed dose estimates after SIRT to safely deliver external radiation to target regions (voxels) that are predicted to be underdosed and to develop deep learning based tools to make voxel-level internal dose estimation practical for routine clinic use. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will perform a Phase 1 clinical trial in HCC patients where we will take the novel approach of using the 90Y PET/CT derived absorbed dose map after SIRT to deliver SBRT to tumor regions predicted to be underdosed based on previously established dose-response models. The primary objective of the trial is to obtain estimates of safety of combined SIRT+SBRT for future Phase II trial design. In parallel, in Aim 2, building on promising initial results we will develop novel deep learning based tools for 90Y PET/CT and SPECT/CT reconstruction, joint reconstruction-segmentation and scatter estimation under the low count-rate setting, typical for 90Y. These methods have a physics/mathematics foundation, where convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are included within the iterative reconstruction process, instead of post-reconstruction denoising. In Aim 3, we will develop a CNN for fast voxel-level dosimetry and combine with the CNNs of Aim 2 to develop an innovative end-to-end framework with unified dosimetry-task based training. At the end of this study, we will be ready to use the new deep learning tools in a Phase II trial to demonstrate enhanced efficacy with SIRT+SBRT compared with SIRT alone and advance towards our long- term goal. This will accelerate adoption of these next-generation tools in clinical practice and will have a significant positive impact because treatment based on patient specific dosimetry will substantially improve efficacy, compared with current standard practice in SIRT. Although we focus on 90Y SIRT, our tools will be applicable in radionuclide therapy in general, a rapidly advancing treatment option. Narrative We will perform a Phase I clinical trial where standard-of-care Y-90 microsphere radioembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma will be followed by external radiation to target regions that are predicted to be underdosed by Y-90, based on patient specific dosimetry. In parallel, we will develop and test voxel-level internal dosimetry tools using convolution neural networks to make such dosimetry-based planning accurate and fast for routine clinic use. This study is relevant to public health because a dosimetry-guided combination radiation treatment approach is likely to substantially improve patient outcome compared to current standard practice of internal or external radiation only.",Imaging and Dosimetry of Yttrium-90 for Personalized Cancer Treatment,10052989,R01EB022075,"['90Y', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Evaluable Disease', 'External Beam Radiation Therapy', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Image', 'Joint repair', 'Joints', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Liver parenchyma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Photons', 'Physics', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radioembolization', 'Radionuclide therapy', 'Reporting', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'dosimetry', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'internal radiation', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'phase II trial', 'prospective', 'radiation delivery', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'trial design', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,670584,0.04853249798073409
"Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is notoriously difficult to diagnose non-invasively, and current methods of assessing CMD utilize only the peak velocity of the coronary flow pattern. While new imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved the assessment coronary perfusion, there are currently no non-invasive methods that incorporate the coronary flow pattern over a complete cardiac cycle to definitively assess and predict the development of CMD.  Coronary blood flow (CBF) reflects the summation of flow in the coronary microcirculation, and our lab has begun to harness the full CBF pattern under varying flow and disease conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes) to determine whether it might harbor novel clues leading to the early detection of CMD. Our past and preliminary data indicate an early onset of CMD in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that occurs prior to the onset of macrovascular complications and that are characterized by blood flow impairments and alterations in coronary resistance microvessel (CRM) structure, function, and biomechanics. Our data also uncovered innovative correlations between CRM structure/biomechanics and our newly-defined features of the coronary flow pattern, some of which were unique to normal or diabetic mice. We have initially utilized these CBF features, in the presence and absence of other factors such as cardiac function, to develop a mathematical model in collaboration with Drs. Christopher Bartlett and William Ray that to date demonstrated that 6 simple factors can predict a normal vs. diabetic coronary flow pattern with 85% predictive accuracy. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the leading cause of heart disease and is associated with hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.

Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the leading cause of heart disease and is associated with hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMD) is comprised of structural and functional deficits of the tiny coronary arteries that may be an earlier indicator of disease prior to the onset of overt CAD. The proposed multidisciplinary research aims to develop a computational artificial intelligence model that will accurately predict CMD based on a non-invasive coronary flow pattern obtained by Doppler echocardiography.",Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease,9999582,R21EB026518,"['Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic mouse', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doppler Echocardiography', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elements', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperemia', 'Hypertension', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Publications', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'coronary perfusion', 'db/db mouse', 'diabetic', 'disorder prevention', 'early onset', 'experimental study', 'heart function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'macrovascular disease', 'mathematical model', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent']",NIBIB,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R21,2020,190000,0.023197598630972684
"An interactive deep-learning method to semi-automatically segment abdominal organs to support stereotactic MR guided online adaptive radiotherapy (SMART) for abdominal cancers Abstract  Stereotactic MRI-guided online adaptive radiotherapy (SMART) is an effective treatment for the pancreas and other upper abdominal cancers. SMART allows precise delivery of escalated prescription dose to the abdominal tumor targets while avoiding the complications of radiation toxicity to the mobile gastrointestinal (GI) organs surrounding the tumor target. In the clinical workflow of SMART, manual segmentation of the GI orangs at risk (OARs) is one of the most important but also the most labor-intensive steps. Manual segmentation takes 10 minutes on average but ranges from 5 to 22 minutes. The slow and costly manual segmentation step directly decreases the accessibility and affordability of online SMART and indirectly reduces the effectiveness of SMART due to intra-fractional body and organ movement of the patients. In this study, we will develop a deep-learning based interactive and semi-automatic procedure to accurately and quickly segment the GI OARs to make SMART more efficient and affordable. Stereotactic MRI-guided online adaptive radiotherapy (SMART) has been demonstrated as an effective treatment for the pancreas and other upper abdominal cancers. For nonresectable pancreatic cancer, SMART increased the overall survival at 36 months from 18% to 55% compared to conventional radiation therapy (RT) treatment. In this study, we will develop a deep-learning based interactive and semi-automatic method to accurately and quickly segment the organs-at- risk (OAR) in the abdomen to support SMART. The method to be developed will significantly expedite the OAR segmentation step and make SMART more efficient and affordable.",An interactive deep-learning method to semi-automatically segment abdominal organs to support stereotactic MR guided online adaptive radiotherapy (SMART) for abdominal cancers,10017990,R03EB028427,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Clinical', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dose', 'Dose-Rate', 'Duodenum', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Kidney', 'Large Intestine', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of abdomen', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Toxicity', 'Radiation therapy', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Small Intestines', 'Stomach', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'computerized', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'gastrointestinal', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'irradiation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'preservation', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment duration', 'tumor']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,74942,0.010956837157104122
"IEEE Medical Imaging Conference Abstract  The IEEE Medical Imaging Conference (MIC) is the leading international scientific meeting bringing together a broad community interested in the physics, engineering and mathematical aspects of medical imaging, with special emphasis on nuclear medicine and multi-modal systems. The MIC runs in conjunction with the IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium (NSS) and the Workshop on Room Temperature Semiconductor X-ray and Gamma-ray Detectors (RTSD).  The purpose of the MIC is to disseminate and foster new research in physics and bio-engineering methods in medical imaging. While the traditional topics of primary interest are related to nuclear medicine techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), increasing space will be also given to recently evolving imaging modalities such as X-ray, CT, optical, MR, with special emphasis on their multi-modal combination with nuclear medical imaging. Recently there has also been additional interest in employing deep learning and AI to enhance the field medical imaging. The conference provides a well-established forum of scientific exchange and dialogue between researchers in academia, industry, and government as well as education of the public, with special emphasis on young generations. This is reflected by the large spectrum of educational refresher sessions and short courses. One of the major objectives of the conference is the education of young investigators, and therefore this NIH R13 proposal seeks $10,000 in funding for each of the next three years to provide 20 trainee grants of $500 each to partially cover costs of MIC conference registration, housing and/or short course fees for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows based at US institutions.  We anticipate that the main impact of this grant program will be to increase attendance of students and postdocs at the 2020 meeting, especially those typically underrepresented, as well as to support their participation in educational activities. It is important to bring young generations, especially women, minorities, and those with disabilities, into the medical imaging field, where they could become main actors in the coming years. They will attend plenary and oral presentations given by many of the world leaders in the nuclear medical imaging instrumentation, image processing, and quantitative analysis fields. Moreover, they will be given the unique opportunity of direct personal interaction through the short courses and dedicated poster presentations. In turn their work will be exposed to the other participants for critical evaluation, constructive suggestions and dissemination. Furthermore, many of these trainees will likely continue in this field, thereby contributing to advancing technology with high societal relevance as being increasingly used in the clinical management of disease and therapeutic interventions. Narrative  The IEEE Medical Imaging Conference (MIC) has the purpose to disseminate and foster new research in physics and bio-engineering methods in medical imaging. The conference covers a variety of medical imaging topics including quantitative imaging, PET/SPECT techniques, image reconstruction, imaging in radiation therapy, portable imaging, multi-modality systems, new medical imaging technologies, CT/MR/optical/ultrasound, parametric/kinetic image modeling, and signal/image processing and modeling. One of the major objectives of the conference is the education and encouragement of young investigators, and therefore this NIH R13 proposal seeks funding to provide twenty grants for each of the next three years to graduate students and postdoctoral fellows based at US institutions to partially cover costs of MIC conference registration and short course fees.",IEEE Medical Imaging Conference,10071524,R13EB030423,"['Academia', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Clinical Management', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational workshop', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Fees', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Gamma Rays', 'Generations', 'Government', 'Grant', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'International', 'Italy', 'Japan', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Technology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nuclear', 'Optics', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Photons', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Semiconductors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Students', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detector', 'disability', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'kinetic model', 'meetings', 'member', 'models and simulation', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'nanoparticle', 'novel', 'nuclear science', 'parametric imaging', 'portability', 'posters', 'programs', 'public education', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiation detector', 'reconstruction', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'theranostics']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R13,2020,10000,0.012065660792130473
"Multi-modal and Extreme PET/MRI Reconstruction Methods Project Summary / Abstract  Hybrid PET/MRI systems are very advantageous for a variety of clinical applications by combining the soft tissue contrast of MRI with the functional and metabolic information of PET. These systems have found success for oncology studies, particularly in head and abdomen/pelvis, as well as for epilepsy, neurological diseases, heart disease, and pediatrics for dose reduction. However, the PET resolution and SNR is typically worse than MRI, and suffers from the loss of feature and data due to motion as well. PET/MRI systems offer the potential to create more accurate, higher resolution PET reconstructions, including correction of artifacts, motion, and im- proved localization, by performing synergistic reconstructions that leverage the simultaneous data acquisition. In particular, this fellowship proposes to develop novel physics-constrained machine learning models for informa- tion sharing between PET and MRI for enhanced spatial localization, estimation of attenuation and activity, and motion. We propose to develop a deep maximum-likelihood estimation of attenuation and activity (MLAA) that can compensate for artifacts and improve PET reconstruction accuracy. We also propose a motion-enhanced joint PET/MRI reconstruction to capture arbitrary motions and reduce dose requirements for chest and abdomen studies. Together, these models aim to improve the PET spatio-temporal resolution, SNR, and quantiﬁcation for a broad range of clinical applications, and will be evaluated for cancer assessment in the pelvis, liver, and lung.  This fellowship will be performed in the Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging at UCSF under the guidance of Prof. Peder Larson, who leads a research program on advanced imaging methods development, and Dr. Thomas Hope, a radiologist and nuclear medicine physician who leads multiple PET/MRI projects. The Department is one of the leading centers in biomedical imaging research, and has been at the forefront on translating PET/MRI systems into clinical practice. The UCSF PET/MRI scanner has dedicated research time, which is also available on other MRI and PET/CT research systems, and extensive computational resources to support the proposed project. The applicant, Dr. Abhejit Rajagopal, has a background in computational imaging and machine learning, will be jointly mentored by this engineer/physician team. He will be trained to become a biomedical imaging scientist by participating in formal coursework on medical imaging systems, training on the PET/MRI system, grant writing, and performing clinical research, supporting his development into a creative, independent biomedical researcher. Project Narrative  Hybrid positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imagery (MRI) imaging systems cur- rently aid in diagnosis and prognosis of numerous types of cancer and disease, but are not always precise enough to accurately measure and track a patient’s response to therapy, particularly in organs and tissue that are sub- ject to motion. There is an unrealized potential here to synergistically combine complimentary PET-MRI data to dramatically improve the spatial resolution and SNR of PET, as well as to create motion-resolved 4D (x,y,z,t) imagery by combining information across modalities and time-frames to combat severe undersampling. These methods will be evaluated in human studies of cancer to capture ﬁne structure and micro-features on moving organs (e.g. lung nodules, liver metastases), ultimately aiding in quantitative characterization of disease.",Multi-modal and Extreme PET/MRI Reconstruction Methods,10069132,F32EB030411,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Chest', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Fellowship', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Implant', 'Joint repair', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metals', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Oncology', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Writing', 'attenuation', 'bioimaging', 'bone', 'cancer type', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'combat', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'heart imaging', 'high resolution imaging', 'imaging modality', 'imaging scientist', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'information model', 'lung imaging', 'method development', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'programs', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'soft tissue', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'systems research', 'uptake']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2020,69426,0.09651733566428818
"Deviceless and Autonomous Prospective Cardiac CT Triggering PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. An estimated 3.8 million men and 3.4 million women die each year from CHD. Cardiac CT is a safe, accurate, non-invasive imaging modality used for diagnosing CHD and for planning therapeutic interventions. Cardiac CT exams are still challenging to perform due to the beating heart and the need to carefully time the scan based on cardiac phase and based on when the peak iodine contrast enhancement is reached. The overall exam duration and the complexity of performing these exams (contrasted with limited reimbursement levels) have limited patient access to cardiac CT to academic hospitals and specialized cardiac imaging centers. As compared to other CT exams, cardiac CT exams require additional patient preparation time, additional CT scans to track the bolus, and additional contrast agent to avoid missing the peak enhancement.  The goal of this project is to develop a smart cardiac CT scanner that autonomously determines the optimal scan time interval without ECG, traditional bolus tracking or timing bolus. Initial results show that it is possible to extract cardiac gating information from a few CT projection measurements prior to the diagnostic CT scan, without reconstruction. This is made possible by an innovative combination of fast X-ray tube pulsing and deep learning raw data analysis. This project builds on GE Research's experience with cardiac CT technologies, deep learning algorithms and X-ray tube physics, as well as the strong clinical cardiac CT expertise at the University of California San Diego.  The outcome of this project will be a clinical feasibility study of the autonomous triggering approach, which has the potential to simplify and increase patient access to cardiac CT, while reducing exam time, reducing con- trast agent volume, and ensuring robust image quality. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop a smart cardiac CT scanner that autonomously determines the optimal scan time interval without ECG, traditional bolus tracking or timing bolus. The result will be a patient-friendly and technologist-friendly cardiac CT exam with reduced exam time, minimal contrast agent volume and radia- tion dose, and robust image quality.",Deviceless and Autonomous Prospective Cardiac CT Triggering,10029731,R01HL153250,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Bolus Infusion', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Ensure', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Iodine', 'Measurement', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preparation', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Rotation', 'Scanning', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'men', 'non-invasive imaging', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'standard of care', 'temporal measurement', 'time interval']",NHLBI,GENERAL ELECTRIC GLOBAL RESEARCH CTR,R01,2020,1060608,0.05079977877389097
"Optimizing Acquisition and Reconstruction of Under-sampled MRI for Signal Detection PROJECT SUMMARY Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a versatile imaging modality that suffers from slow acquisition times which is a challenge for both time sensitive applications and for patient throughput. Accelerating MRI would benefit patients both by reducing the time they need to be in the scanner and in reducing the cost of healthcare. This project is part of a larger scientific effort to accelerate MRI while maintaining the diagnostic quality. Acceleration, even by a factor of two would result in a major advance for public health. Two of the current approaches to accelerate MRI rely on collecting less data (under-sampling) and constrained or deep learning reconstruction. These approaches can lead to images with diagnostic quality with significant under-sampling but may suffer from artifacts which are hard to characterize. Specifically, this project will optimize the performance of constrained reconstruction and deep learning on detecting subtle lesions in acquiring and reconstructing under-sampled MRI. To carry out this optimization, we will first develop the methods required for detection of lesions by machine and human observer models. Then the models will be validated by psychophysical studies where humans perform the detection task. In the first aim of this project, we will optimize constrained reconstruction based on the ideal linear observer. We will consider under-sampled acquisition strategies in 2D MRI including one and two dimensional subsampling methods with constrained reconstruction using both wavelet and total variation constraints. We will perform simulations using anatomical backgrounds both for lesions which match the prior information of the constraints and those which do not to better understand how choices in acquisition and reconstruction affect ideal detection. While the ideal linear observer approximates the best possible detection, typically the signal detection is carried out by a human. In the second aim, we will optimize constrained reconstruction using human observer models and validate the models using human observer studies. A recent approach to reconstruction of under- sampled images is based on deep learning. In the third aim, this work will optimize deep learning reconstruction based on ideal and human observers. Due to the complexity of the deep learning approach, having this task-based approach to optimization is particularly relevant. This project will optimize a network using signal detection to better understand how training and architecture choices in the neural network affect detection of lesions which are not included in training images. This research project will help to strengthen the research environment at Manhattan College by involving students in biomedical research incorporating applied mathematics, statistics and data science. PROJECT NARRATIVE Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a versatile imaging modality that suffers from slow acquisition times which is a challenge for both time sensitive applications and for patient throughput.

"Real-time prostate lesion tracking during SBRT Multiple randomized clinical trials have shown that delivery of higher radiation doses to the prostate results in improved tumor control rates in prostate cancer radiation therapy (RT). As local recurrence mostly occurs at the primary tumor, particularly for high-risk patients, additional dose escalation is expected to improve the treatment outcome. However, the application of dose escalation for prostate RT is greatly limited by the tolerance of nearby healthy tissues that cannot adequately be excluded from the radiation field. This limitation can be overcome by dose painting, where a higher dose is applied to the prostate tumor only instead of the whole prostate gland. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) offers reduced treatment time, convenience, and possibly increased treatment efficacy as compared to the conventionally fraction scheme. UTSW is currently conducting a dose escalation trial using SBRT for high-risk prostate cancer patients with an integrated dose boost on MRI-visualized prostate tumor. However, prostate can move and deform during the beam delivery. To ensure the escalated dose is actually delivered to tumor regions as planned, a reliable tumor tracking method is urgently needed. While intra-prostatic tumors can be identified by multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) for treatment planning, intrafraction tumor tracking during the beam delivery is not achievable with mpMRI. In contrast, ultrasound offers a cost-effective and real-time imaging with high soft tissue contrast. However, conventional ultrasound techniques only provide anatomic structure of the prostate gland without the capability to differentiate tumor region from the rest of the prostate gland. Temporal enhanced ultrasound (TeUS) has emerged as a new paradigm for prostate tissue characterization by analyzing the time-series ultrasound images with advanced machine learning techniques. In this project, we aim to develop, optimize and evaluate an innovative TeUS based intra-prostatic tumor tracking method to guide SBRT with an integrated dose boost for high-risk prostate cancer patients. The specific aims are: 1) Develop TeUS-based intra-prostatic tumor delineation for guiding focused dose escalation; 2) Integrate and validate TeUS-based tumor tracking system during SBRT; and 3) Evaluate clinical gain of TeUS guided SBRT for high risk prostate cancer patients. Successful completion of the proposed project will lead to the development and validation of a low-cost yet highly accurate TeUS guided system for targeted prostate cancer RT. With enhanced real-time visualization of tumor, the use of TeUS for RT guidance will lead to better treatment efficacy and reduced toxicity. Delivery of higher radiation doses to the tumor region can improve outcome of radiation therapy for high-risk prostate cancer patients. As the prostate can move and deform during radiation beam delivery, there is an urgent need for a reliable method to ensure escalated dose is delivered to the tumor region as planned. We will develop, integrate and evaluate a novel prostate tumor tracking method based on temporal enhanced ultrasound (TeUS) to guide radiation therapy for high-risk patients, which will lead to higher local control with improved toxicity.",Real-time prostate lesion tracking during SBRT,9915917,R01EB027898,"['Aftercare', 'Anatomy', 'Area Under Curve', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'External Beam Radiation Therapy', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Probability', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Prostatic', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rectum', 'Recurrence', 'Rest', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapy trial', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urethra', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'advanced prostate cancer', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'early phase trial', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prostate biopsy', 'prostate cancer risk', 'prostate lesions', 'real-time images', 'soft tissue', 'standard care', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'vibration']",NIBIB,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,351181,-0.007620371010211813
"Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma Glioblastoma is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Despite advances in neurosurgical resection, radiation targeting, and chemotherapy, the prognosis remains grim with a median survival of just 15 months. The effectiveness of current radiation therapy strategies is severely limited by shortcomings in the imaging modalities used to develop treatment plans. Current radiation therapy planning is mainly based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, which identifies high grade tumors that are immediately associated with leaky neovasculature. Although it is an excellent diagnostic tool to identify high grade from low grade tumors, it is unable to signal occult infiltration beyond the core of the tumor. Though many believe GBM to be an incurable disease, we believe we have identified a method for optimizing tumor targeting that will increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy. A significant component of the current problem in GBM therapy is the lack of treatment for non-enhancing regions that are significantly infiltrated by neoplastic glioma cells without neovascularization. This untreated population undoubtedly leads to early recurrence. The proposed study addresses an important step toward translating an advanced quantitative imaging modality that complements the conventional imaging that is capable of reliably revealing glioma- infiltrated regions for precise, personalized treatment targeting. Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an alternative modality able to identify endogenous metabolism within tissue without the need for exogenous contrast, and has been shown to identify the metabolic abnormalities associated with tumor beyond the regions identified by T1-weighted MRI. The clinical integration of sMRI in patient management has been limited due to the computational challenges of analysis of sMRI data. Two key hurdles to be overcome are the insufficiency of filters to remove image artifacts and the necessity of quantification of metabolic levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism. As a result, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and many hours of computational and user time. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in radiation therapy planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning, an approach to computation that has shattered benchmarks in many medical and non-medical problems. Specifically, we will develop filters for removing artifacts, algorithms for personalized diagnosis of tumor infiltration, and explore deep learning as a method to synthesize sMRI data with anatomical and clinical metrics in a fully automated fashion. Success in the proposed work will produce a “scanner-to-clinician” platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into the clinical radiation therapy planning paradigm. Ultimately, we believe this additional modality in the physician's tool belt will lead to better outcomes in patients suffering from this debilitating disease. Project Narrative  Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is a molecular imaging modality that can accurately detect abnormalities in the metabolic signatures of tumor cells, making it ideal for the detection and monitoring of highly infiltrative brain tumors like glioblastoma. Clinical adoption of sMRI has been slow due to limited tools for expedient and objective processing of sMRI data into information that oncologists can use for therapy planning.

"Automated Treatment Planning for High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy for Cervical Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY Cervical cancer affects approximately 7.4/100,000 women in the US with minority women being disproportionally affected. High dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy is an effective treatment modality by irradiating the tumor from inside while simultaneously sparing dose to nearby organs. Multiple randomized trials revealed that including HDR brachytherapy in cervical cancer radiotherapy increases overall survival rates from 46.2% to 58.2%. Yet HDR brachytherapy has seen a downward trend in its use, with complex treatment planning process being one of the major reasons, causing a 13% reduction in cause-specific survival rate. For HDR brachytherapy, the planning has to be accomplished in a very short period of time to reduce patient discomfort and patient motion during the planning process, which could causes substantial deviation of planning geometry from delivery geometry (1.5mm motion leads to >10% change in dose). At present, it takes on average 135 min to manually generate a treatment plan. Due to the time pressure, suboptimal plans are often generated. D2cc, the dosimetric quantity correlated to organ toxicity could be further reduced up to 8.4%, corresponding to 5.1% reduction of complication rate. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop a fully automated treatment planning process to reduce planning time, improve plan quality and therefore outcome, reduce patient discomfort, and most significantly, to promote the use of HDR brachytherapy. Our group has successfully developed and clinically implemented the AutoBrachy system, an automatic planning tool that generates a patient-generic plan in 3 minutes. However, automatic organ segmentation and physician-oriented treatment planning are missing, preventing a fully automated process to generate the patient-specific optimal plan. Current practice relies on human expertise to solve the two problems, taking up to 90 min for segmentation and 30 min for planner and physician to finalize plan. Given the recent advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) in mimicking humans to achieve human-level performance, we believe that AI can be used to empower AutoBrachy to achieve a fully automated planning process. The overall goal of this fellowship project is to develop AI-based organ segmentation and human-like treatment planning modules in AutoBrachy, and to validate the system in real patient cases. We will pursue two specific aims (SAs): SA1: System development. Create an automatic organ segmentation module and a human-like automatic planning module. SA2: System validation. Perform a retrospective study to evaluate the effectiveness of the developments. The innovation is the use of state-of-the-art AI techniques to solve critical problems in HDR brachytherapy. This project is logically built on the candidate’s engineering background and medical physics training. It targets at a disease that is highly significant to the underserved population, for which the candidate is highly motivated to solve. The project also fits perfectly with the candidate's long-term career goal of establishing a high-quality independent research program to develop state-of-the-art treatment methods for cancer radiotherapy. NARRATIVE This project will develop and validate artificial intelligence based computational modules for automatic organ segmentation and human-like treatment planning to achieve a fully automated and streamlined treatment planning process for high-dose-rate brachytherapy treatment of cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is a severe disease, particularly affecting underserved population who typically present at advanced stages. The developed tools will lead to clinical benefits to patients by improving plan quality, planning efficiency, and patient comfort, as well as will reduce the technical burden of high-dose-rate brachytherapy and therefore promote the use of this effective therapeutic modality to yield broad impacts.",Automated Treatment Planning for High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy for Cervical Cancer,9991582,F31CA243504,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bladder', 'Brachytherapy', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Fellowship', 'Genetic', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'High-Dose Rate Brachytherapy', 'Human', 'Institution', 'International', 'Irradiated tumor', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rectum', 'Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sigmoid colon', 'Small Intestines', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Underserved Population', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'experience', 'health care availability', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'trend', 'tumor']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,F31,2020,34644,0.010585178720075642
"Fast motion-robust fetal neuroimaging with MRI PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Fetal-brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an invaluable tool for studying the early development of the brain and can resolve diagnostic ambiguities that may remain after routine ultrasound exams. Unfortunately, high levels of fetal and maternal motion (1) limit fetal MRI to rapid two-dimensional (2D) sequences and frequently introduce dramatic artifacts such as (2) image misorientation relative to the standard sagittal, coronal, axial planes needed for clinical assessment and (3) partial to complete signal loss. These factors lead to the inefficient practice of repeating ~30 s stack-of-slices acquisitions until motion-free images have been obtained. Throughout the session, technologists manually adjust the orientation of scans in response to motion, and about 38% of datasets are typically discarded. Thus, subject motion is the fundamental impediment to reaping the full benefits of MRI for answering clinical and investigational questions in the fetus. The overarching goal of this project is to overcome the challenges posed by motion by exploiting innovations in deep learning, which have enabled image-analysis algorithms with unprecedented speed and reliability. We propose to integrate these into the MRI acquisition pipeline to unlock the potential of fetal MRI. We will develop practical pulse-sequence technology for automated and dynamically motion-corrected fetal neuroimaging without the need for external hardware or calibration. We hypothesize that this will radically improve the quality and success rates of clinical and research studies, while dramatically reducing patient discomfort and cost. We propose as Aim 1 to eradicate (2) the vulnerability of acquisitions to image-brain misorientation with rapid, automated prescription of standard anatomical planes. In Aim 2, we propose to address (3) motion during the scan with real-time correction of fetal-head motion. An anatomical stack-of-slices acquisition will be interleaved with volumetric navigators. These will be used to measure motion as it happens in the scanner and to adaptively update the slice tilt/position. We propose as Aim 3 to develop a 3D radial sequence and estimate motion between subsets of radial spokes for real-time self-navigation. Adaptively updating the orientation of spokes and selectively re-acquiring corrupted subsets at the end of the scan will enable 3D imaging of the fetal brain (1). Since the applicant has a physics background, the proposed training program at MIT and HMS will focus on deep learning and fetal development/neuroscience during the K99 phase to develop the skills needed for transitioning to independence in the R00 phase. The applicant’s goal is to become a fetal image acquisition and analysis scientist acting as bridge between deep learning, MRI and clinical fetal-imaging applications to shift the boundaries of what is currently possible with state-of-the-art technology. Fulfilling the research aims will promote this, as it will result in a practical framework for automation and motion correction, applicable to a wide variety of fetal neuroimaging sequences. PROJECT NARRATIVE Subject motion is the fundamental impediment to reaping the full benefits of fetal-brain magnetic resonance imaging, as it frequently produces images with dramatic artifacts. The goal of this project is to exploit innovations in deep learning and integrate them into the acquisition pipeline to overcome the challenges posed by motion in fetal neuroimaging studies.

"Improving Pediatric SPECT Imaging: Enhanced Lesion Detection with Dose Reduction through Advanced Reconstruction and Motion Correction Nuclear medicine imaging in children has been shown to have significant clinical value across all organ systems. In providing this significant benefit it is critical to minimize the radiation dose used in pediatric patients, whose risk for adverse health effects (such as cancer) per unit administered activity is much higher than that of adults, owing to their higher tissue sensitivity and longer potential lifespan. The governing principle of this project will be to minimize radiation dose while methodically ensuring that lesion detection performance is fully preserved. This will be accomplished by using validations based on both numerical and physician observers measuring performance in tasks that emulate those performed clinically. We will employ two approaches in tandem to enable lowering dose while maintaining performance. First, we will use advanced image reconstruction and processing techniques. Corrections for various forms of image quality degradation will be incorporated in the reconstruction, and deep learning (DL) will be used for post-reconstruction denoising. Second, we will develop methods to correct for both body and respiratory motion, which degrade diagnostic accuracy. Correcting for body and respiratory motion will allow dose to be reduced without loss of image quality and will also offer a technological alternative to using sedation or even general anesthesia to minimize motion when imaging children. For this investigation we have selected 99mTc-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal imaging as a testbed to demonstrate our approaches. Damage to the renal cortex resulting from infection of the kidneys is a critical issue in children, including newborns and toddlers. DMSA SPECT is the “gold-standard” in the evaluation of pyelonephritis and renal scarring post- infection. The concepts we will demonstrate for reduction of radiation dose and correction of motion with DMSA will be translatable to other SPECT (and PET) studies in pediatric imaging and beyond.  Our Specific Aims are: 1. Establish infrastructure for investigating and evaluating advanced reconstruction and motion correction; 2. Determine the extent of radiation dose reduction to pediatric patients through improved reconstruction and DL denoising while maintaining optimal full-dose lesion detection accuracy; 3. Develop data-driven and depth-sensing camera methods for body and respiratory motion estimation and correction; and 4. Conduct numerical and physician observer studies to validate the level of dose reduction enabled by DL denoising and motion correction. Narrative  In nuclear medicine imaging, it is critical to minimize the radiation dose used in pediatric patients, whose risk for adverse health effects (such as cancer) per unit administered activity is much higher than that in adults, owing to their higher tissue sensitivity and longer potential lifespan. Correcting for body and respiratory motion occurring during imaging will improve the quality of the formed three-dimensional images of the patient by reducing blurring and image artifacts and offer a technological alternative to using sedation or even general anesthesia to reduce motion when imaging children, which can bear health risks of its own. We propose an advanced reconstruction methodology which would enable reduction in the amount of activity administered and compensate for patient motion during imaging.",Improving Pediatric SPECT Imaging: Enhanced Lesion Detection with Dose Reduction through Advanced Reconstruction and Motion Correction,9914572,R01EB029315,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'DMSA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Freedom', 'Gaussian model', 'General Anesthesia', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Longevity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Newborn Infant', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Pyelonephritis', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Scheme', 'Sedation procedure', 'Societies', 'Statistical Study', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toddler', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'base', 'body system', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'denoising deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kidney cortex', 'kidney infection', 'molecular imaging', 'pediatric patients', 'preservation', 'reconstruction', 'renal scarring', 'respiratory', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2020,773763,0.04465178772591212
"High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is in response to PA 18-484. In the BRAIN 2025 Report, PET (positron emission tomography) is identified as “the best means to translate studies of neurotransmitters, receptors, and neuromodulators to humans.” However dynamic assessment of receptor occupancy and metabolism is hindered by the spatial resolution and sensitivity of even the most modern of clinically available PET scanners. To address this challenge, we propose a next generation PET detector with a highly innovative design: a detector module with a layered scintillator structure and a side readout configuration. The crystal slabs in the module are stacked along the depth direction and are optically separated by reflective films. The scintillation light created in each layer is measured by photodetectors located on the four sides of the crystal. Compared with traditional PET detectors, which contain pixelated crystal arrays, the new design has the following advantages: (1) The layered structure provides depth of interaction (DOI) information such that a smaller diameter detector ring can be used without increasing parallax error, increasing sensitivity while lowering costs. (2) The four-sided readout method improves the energy resolution of the system with increased scintillation light collection efficiency by reducing light loss due to total internal reflection. (3) Sub millimeter spatial resolution is achievable without using very small pitch crystal arrays, since the interaction location in each crystal layer is determined via machine learning- based decoding of the light distribution collected on the four crystal sides. Therefore the production cost of the crystals is reduced. (4) Since the interaction location and energy resolution for each layer are determined independently, the system sensitivity can be increased by stacking more layers in the module without affecting the spatial and energy resolution of the system. (5) For side readout setup, a larger ratio of cross-sectional area to length requires fewer photodetectors to cover all four sides of the module; this reduces photodetector cost. The first four points above have been demonstrated in preliminary studies using a small, prototype module. We propose to build a large scale detector module with this new design to verify the fifth advantage, and to study the effect of detector size on the first four. The outcome of this proposal will be two DOI enabled detector modules with excellent spatial resolution (~1 mm) and energy resolution (~10%), as well as good timing resolution (~400 ps), and DOI resolution (~ 3 mm) and high system sensitivity. A full characterization study for the two modules and imaging studies for both the Derenzo and Hoffman brain phantoms will address the current limitations of human brain PET scanners, and will serve as the foundation for a new dynamic PET scanner for neuroimaging. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop a novel design for detector modules used in brain-dedicated PET system with good spatial resolution, energy resolution, timing resolution, and DOI resolution, as well as high sensitivity. If successful, the study will pave the way for building a novel PET system for greatly improved dynamic PET imaging of the human brain.",High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging,10017238,R01EB028337,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Crystallization', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Film', 'Foundations', 'Gamma Rays', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurotransmitter Receptor', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Portugal', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Production', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rod', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Thinness', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'base', 'brain size', 'cost', 'design', 'detector', 'human imaging', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'millimeter', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'photomultiplier', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'response']",NIBIB,"CANON MEDICAL RESEARCH USA, INC.",R01,2020,243919,0.023061019213166153
"Hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT: A new paradigm for image guidance in liver SBRT ABSTRACT This proposal aims to establish a hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT system for precision image guidance in radiation therapy of liver cancer. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) improves the treatment outcome over conventional fractionated radiotherapy by delivering high fractional dose in few fractions. However, SBRT of liver cancer still has high local failure rate up to 20-30% at 2-3 years and high overall grade>=3 toxicity rate up to 30% with patient deaths from the treatment. Previous studies demonstrated a strong correlation between the treatment outcome and the tumor localization accuracy of the image guidance technique used. Currently, cone beam CT (CBCT) is the most widely used imaging technique for liver SBRT. However, CBCT has extremely limited soft tissue contrast with no visualization of most liver tumors. As a result, its localization error is frequently over 6mm, and the dose coverage of tumor volume can fall below 90%, which is far from enough for tumor control. Drastically reducing localization errors is imperative to improve the outcome of liver SBRT. Combined MRI-Radiotherapy machines could provide MRI contrast for liver tumor localization. However, such machines are rare and expensive for most clinics. As such, an alternative solution is urgently required to meet the ubiquitous need of all radiation oncology departments: a solution in the form of a novel low-cost imaging system with MRI equivalent contrast. Since CBCT is readily available on most radiotherapy machines, creating CBCT-based imaging systems would be the most effective strategy. Our recent publication demonstrated the feasibility of such strategy. (Harris, Med Phys 2018) Our long-term goal is to establish the next generation of CBCT systems with virtual multi-modality imaging capabilities for high precision tumor localization and adaptive therapy in radiation therapy. In this application, our overall objective is to establish a novel system to generate hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT from CBCT, with virtual-MRI inside the liver for target localization and augmented CBCT outside the liver for healthy tissue verification. The specific aims are: (1). Establish a 3D hybrid virtual- MRI/CBCT system for image guidance in breath-hold liver SBRT without respiratory motion. (2). Establish a 4D hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT system for image guidance in free-breathing liver SBRT with respiratory motion. (3). Optimize and clinically evaluate the systems through simulation studies and a prospective clinical trial. Our expected deliverables through the academic-industrial partnership are novel hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT systems ready to be integrated to all radiotherapy machines with only CBCT systems. This new imaging capability will have significant clinical impact because it will create a paradigm shift in image-guided radiation therapy by revolutionizing the widely used CBCT systems to enable a new era of low-cost high-precision virtual multi- modality guided radiotherapy. This precision guidance can lead to breakthrough in escalating the tumor control and minimizing the toxicities of liver SBRT as well as treatments of other sites with tumors in the soft tissue. Project Narrative The hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT system will be a low-cost imaging system with superb soft tissue contrast to provide precise image guidance for liver SBRT, which paves the road to further margin reduction and dose escalation. As a result, this novel system has a great potential to enhance the tumor local control and reduce the normal tissue toxicities for all patients under liver SBRT treatments. Finally yet importantly, the hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT system can also be potentially applicable for improving the image guidance precision of radiation therapy treatments of other clinical sites with tumors in the soft tissue, such as breast and prostate cancers.",Hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT: A new paradigm for image guidance in liver SBRT,10021659,R01EB028324,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Breathing', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Financial compensation', 'Fractionated radiotherapy', 'Goals', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation therapy', 'Residual state', 'Site', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Volume', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'clinically significant', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'falls', 'image guided', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'multimodality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'recursive neural network', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,496097,0.011139810644815382
"Development of advanced cardiac SPECT imaging technologies Project Abstract Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) continues to play a critical role in the diagnosis and management of coronary artery disease (CAD). While conventional SPECT scanners using parallel-hole collimators are still the foundation of cardiac SPECT, recently our field observed an exciting growth of new developments of dedicated cardiac scanners. Such dedicated scanners, such as the GE Alcyone 530/570c systems and the D-SPECT systems both with CZT detectors, typically have multiple detectors collecting photons emitted from the heart simultaneously, leading to dramatically improved sensitivity (2-5 X). In addition, the GE systems use pinhole collimators and can achieve much higher resolution. These dedicated scanners opened doors to new applications with significant clinical impact, including ultra-low-dose imaging, absolute quantification of myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), high resolution molecular imaging, multi-isotope imaging, motion correction, and many more. Most of these new applications are uniquely achievable only using dedicated scanners. While the dedicated cardiac SPECT systems can improve clinical practice and lead to numerous new clinical applications, such systems are far from being optimized to fully realize their great potentials. In this grant, we propose to systematically develop and optimize innovative imaging technologies for the GE 530/570c systems to further improve its clinical efficacy in a variety of significant ways. In Aim 1, we will develop and optimize methods for static cardiac SPECT imaging. We will develop various deep learning methods and investigate approaches to increase angular sampling to reduce noise, and improve resolution and quantitative accuracy. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate methods for dynamic SPECT imaging, particularly involving direct parametric image reconstruction. In Aim 3, we will develop and validate methods for dual-isotope SPECT. Monte Carso simulation and deep learning based methods will be developed for tracers with different spatial distributions and fast kinetics. In all three aims, large animal studies and human subject data will be used for optimization and validation.

"Osteoarthritis: Quantitative Evaluation of Whole Joint Disease with MRI Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is an enormous clinical problem and worldwide cause of disability. Development of new therapies for OA is hampered by a lack of sensitive imaging tests that respond to changes in disease status.

This project will compare changes seen at 3T and 7T across two different vendors systems and assess the potential for 7T MRI to improve our ability to study and develop new disease- modifying therapies. This study will enhance future studies and clinical exams at 7T and can be used to improve routine 3T MRI though machine learning reconstruction and enhanced understanding of OA disease mechanisms. Understanding the relative strengths of 3T and 7T MRI in this important clinical application is critical to developing new disease-modifying treatments for patients with OA.

"Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging and automated textural radiomics for assessment of human placenta accreta spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY  Placenta Accreta Spectrum (PAS) disorder is a condition in which the placenta fails to separate partially or totally from the uterine wall, resulting in significant intrapartum maternal morbidity and mortality at delivery. Depending on the extent of the placental invasion into surrounding tissue, hysterectomy may be lifesaving. Assessment of PAS severity prior to delivery is crucial for multidisciplinary surgical planning and patient counseling. However, there is an unmet clinical need for quantitative, objective measures of abnormal placentation that can serve as predictors of risk of invasion and hysterectomy. The overall goal of the proposed project is to prospectively assess PAS in high-risk women across gestation using quantitative multi-parametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and automated textural radiomics and to correlate findings with surgical outcomes.  Coming from a highly interdisciplinary background of MR chemistry, biology, and physics, the candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator with in-depth knowledge and skills to conduct translational placental imaging research. The candidate's short-term goal is to complete a pilot study under the mentorship of an interdisciplinary advisory committee to evaluate PAS in women with high-risk pregnancies using multi-parametric MRI and textural radiomics.  To meet these goals, the following research aims are proposed: 1) Evaluate placental invasion across gestation using multi-parametric MR imaging and deep learning based novel quantification tools in PAS high- risk pregnancies, and 2) Extract the radiomic pattern across gestation of high-risk PAS placenta and determine its association with clinical surgical outcome. These research aims will serve as the platform for the career development plan and training aims which include: 1) Gain knowledge in translational prospective research design, 2) Improve technical skills in advanced clinical MR acquisition development, 3) Acquire applied statistical and data analysis skills, and 4) Develop mentorship and leadership skills while under training.  Together, the research and training aims will provide the training, experience and preliminary data for an R01 application. The future R01 will develop a clinical and surgical outcome prediction model for high-risk PAS pregnancies, potentially improving maternal and fetal outcomes. The training will position the candidate to become a leader in translational placental imaging research. PROJECT NARRATIVE After a woman has had a cesarean delivery, if the placenta implants on the surgical scar in a subsequent pregnancy, there is a risk for invasion, referred to as placenta accreta spectrum (PAS); depending on its severity, a cesarean hysterectomy may be required with significant morbidity. Imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance (MR) imaging have shown promise in defining characteristics that alert the obstetrician to the severity of PAS. We will explore the vascularity and tissue characteristics of the placenta with MRI and identify quantitative predictive markers of disease severity and hope to better understand the pathophysiology of placenta accreta spectrum.",Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging and automated textural radiomics for assessment of human placenta accreta spectrum,10105139,K25HD104004,"['Abnormal placentation', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cellularity', 'Cesarean section', 'Characteristics', 'Chemistry', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Risk Woman', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Human', 'Hysterectomy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Perinatal', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Accreta', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Spin Labels', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uterus', 'Visualization', 'Woman', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'fetal', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'implantation', 'improved', 'interest', 'intrapartum', 'maternal morbidity', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'recruit', 'skills', 'soft tissue', 'surgery outcome', 'tool']",NICHD,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,K25,2020,114184,0.01841940631293312
"Combined Cardiopulmonary Failure in COPD: SPIROMICS HF The death rate and hospitalizations from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have doubled in the last 50 years. A third of COPD hospitalizations overlap with heart failure, mostly with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), yet no large COPD study has ascertained cardiac function. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) COPD Study was funded to test the endothelial hypothesis of emphysema and examine reduced RV dimensions (“cor pulmonale parvus”) in COPD. In the MESA COPD Study II, we found that associations of reduced pulmonary microvascular blood flow with emphysema do not appear to be confounded by hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and that emphysema on CT predicted RV regression over 5 years. We also developed methods to further subtype emphysema and COPD and scaled them up to the SubPopulations and InteRmediate Outcome Measures In COPD Study (SPIROMICS). We used unsupervised machine learning to discover new emphysema subtypes that are common and have molecular origins. Separately, we found that 26% of adults have segmental airway variants, which are associated with COPD and the developmental genes FGF10 and RARA. Both genes affect right heart development. In pilot work, we found one dramatically altered RV strain and the other associated with cor pulmonale parvus. Finally, we found that bronchitic ‘symptomatic smokers,’ who have hyperinflation from gas trapping, may have increased LV diastolic dysfunction. Hence, cardiac alterations in COPD are complex but recent advances in COPD subtyping may allow their personalized diagnosis and treatment. SPIROMICS is an NHLBI-funded prospective study that recruited smokers with COPD and controls and is re-examining 2,000 participants with gold- standard lung phenotyping including full-lung CT. We propose to add comprehensive echocardiography (echo) with speckle-tracking for cardiac mechanics for 1,000 SPIROMICS participants, with exercise in 700 and cardiopulmonary MRI in 600, to test the following hypotheses: 1) machine-learned subtypes of emphysema on CT are associated with specific alterations in cardiac structure and function, which vary from cor pulmonale to LV diastolic dysfunction; 2) participants with segmental airway variants have abnormal RV structure and function; 3) symptomatic smokers have signs of increased LV afterload and LV diastolic dysfunction. Innovative aspects of the application include the use of novel echo and MRI measures in a large, well- characterized cohort of COPD patients. Confirmation of the hypotheses would define the mechanisms of HFpEF in COPD and identify subsets of patients for targeted treatment of cardiopulmonary dysfunction. The death rate and hospitalizations from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have doubled in the last 50 years. A third of COPD hospitalizations overlap with heart failure, mostly with preserved ejection fraction. The proposed study would be the first large study with gold-standard phenotyping of the heart and lungs and would test highly specific hypothesized based upon recent advances in lung subphenotyping to yield personalized approaches to combined cardiopulmonary disease in COPD.",Combined Cardiopulmonary Failure in COPD: SPIROMICS HF,10020427,R01HL093081,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Apical', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DRD1 gene', 'Death Rate', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Drops', 'EFRAC', 'Echocardiography', 'Endothelium', 'Exercise', 'FGF10 gene', 'Failure', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gases', 'Genes', 'Gold', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Kinetics', 'Lung', 'Lung CAT Scan', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Myocardial', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Pulmonary Heart Disease', 'Pulmonary artery structure', 'RARA gene', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Right Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Right ventricular structure', 'Sampling', 'Smoker', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiogenesis', 'cohort', 'disorder control', 'disorder subtype', 'genetic variant', 'heart function', 'heart preservation', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'lung hypoxia', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'patient subsets', 'personalized approach', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'receptor', 'recruit', 'targeted treatment', 'unsupervised learning', 'vasoconstriction']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,2331272,-0.02417781856898381
"Title: Neurobiology of seizure generalization during electroconvulsive therapy for major depression PROJECT SUMMARY Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a highly effective treatment for severe depression and other mental health conditions, yet how ECT changes the brain to ameliorate the symptoms of depression is not well understood. Seizure generalization appears to be critical for successful antidepressant response to ECT, and stimulation dose is adjusted to ensure an “adequate” seizure. Previous studies have linked seizure generalization during ECT with thalamocortical regions, and our own MRI studies indicate that thalamocortical networks exhibit neuroplasticity after treatment in patients who respond to ECT. Yet, despite recent growth in the number of MRI studies measuring long-term neuroplasticity across ECT sessions, relatively less is known about the neurobiology of seizure activity elicited during each session. The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to understand how ECT-induced seizures change brain networks to treat depression. To address this goal, we will take a data-driven, machine learning approach to pre-existing ECT-MRI datasets of patients with depression, to identify the neurobiological features measured with MRI (functional connectivity, gray-matter morphometry, electric fields) that optimally explain inter-patient variability in seizure indicators (seizure duration and stimulation dose). Aim 1 will identify biomarkers of susceptibility to ECT-induced seizures by analyzing pre-treatment MRI with respect to initial stimulation dose and seizure duration. Aim 2 studies will determine how brain network plasticity over the course of ECT relates to changes in stimulation dose and duration of ECT-induced seizures. These studies will further our understanding of therapeutic seizures in ECT, potentially facilitating prediction of optimal dose and/or treatment outcome to improve ECT and minimize side effects. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a highly effective treatment for severe depression and other mental health conditions, yet how ECT changes the brain to ameliorate the symptoms of depression is not well understood.

"MR Fingerprinting for Epilepsy Abstract Epilepsy affects 65 million people worldwide; approximately 30% of them do not respond to medications but can be cured by surgery. Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a major pathology for medically intractable epilepsies, is frequently missed by visual analysis of the conventional MRI, making surgical treatment very difficult. We propose to develop a novel quantitative MRI acquisition and analysis framework specific for epilepsy patients, which could provide more sensitive and specific measures of brain structure, thereby improving FCD detection and subtype prediction. To this end, the quantitative framework will be developed and validated in three steps: (1) Develop high-resolution Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) scan that allows simultaneous quantification of multiple tissue property maps efficiently, accurately and precisely. These quantitative maps have shown to be more sensitive and specific on detecting and characterizing subtle signal abnormalities. (2) Develop image post-processing methods to analyze quantitative maps, which will provide quantitative measurements that highlight additional morphological features, such as gray-white boundary blurring, abnormal cortical thickness and folding. (3) Develop machine-learning-based feature screening and prediction tools to characterize group-level features differentiating FCD subtypes, and predict individual-level FCD location and subtyping. Because detection and subtype prediction of FCD are both associated with seizure outcomes, epileptologists can use this tool to provide more personalized and customized counseling. The result of our proposed work promises a paradigm shift by converting the current standard-care of visual/qualitative MRI review to a quantitative framework, including data acquisition, post-processing and decision support tool, that would eventually lead to better treatment planning, reduction in unnecessary pre-surgical evaluation tests (especially invasive evaluation), and improved post-operative seizure outcomes in patients with devastating and disabling medically intractable epilepsy. The quantitative nature of our acquisition/analysis methods also makes it possible to be uniformly adopted by other centers with high consistency.

"Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident Summary Following a large scale radiological or nuclear event, hundreds of thousands of people may be exposed to ionizing radiation/s and require subsequent dose-dependent medical management. It will be crucial to collect and analyze human biofluids (such as blood, urine, saliva) as soon as possible within the first week for accurate dose prediction and early triage decision. There is a need for FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic high-throughput biodosimetry devices with the ability to determine past radiation exposure with precision and accuracy. At the Center for High Throughput Radiation Biodosimetry, the Columbia University Center for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR), we have developed FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system, to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human peripheral blood samples for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. The protein panel also includes biomarkers for blood leukocyte subtypes to reflect hematological sensitivity and injury. The FAST- DOSE assay system is intended as an in vitro diagnostic device (IVD) as defined by 21 CFR 809.3. The platform uses a commercial imaging flow cytometry system (ImageStream®X) and associated Image Data Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEAS®) to rapidly quantify changes in biomarker expression levels within specific cellular structures using fluorescent imagery and algorithms for estimation of absorbed dose. The studies planned here are designed to develop and optimize our FAST-DOSE assay system to accurately estimate absorbed dose and assess hematopoietic injury in human lymphocytes after ionizing irradiation. The first objective is to build on our current biomarker validation data for early engagement with the FDA via the pre-submission process. We have used the human ex vivo model and humanized mouse (Hu-NSG) and non- human primate (NHP) models to validate biomarker expression and radiosensitivity in blood leukocytes after acute ionizing radiation exposure. The Specific Aims proposed here are designed to: optimize the assay protocol and identify biomarker dose/time kinetics for accurate dose predictions in vitro and test 1) inter-donor variation, 2) intra-donor variation and 3) inter-laboratory variability (Aim 1); test the effect of specific confounders: age and sex, inheritance with germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant, and inflammation and trauma on the biomarker response, before and after irradiation (Aim 2); measure biomarker levels and time kinetics in vivo and correlate with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts, and stem and progenitor cell levels in the bone marrow of Hu-NSG mice (Aim 3) and, develop mathematical models (using machine learning and regression techniques) to select the best FAST-DOSE biomarkers and their combinations for generating dose predictions based on the ex vivo and in vivo dose response of these biomarkers (Aim 4). Our vision for future development is to develop a more simplified, faster rapid FAST-DOSE assay system whereby the biomarkers could be developed and transitioned for use in a point-of-care (POC) device. NARRATIVE We have developed a high-throughput biodosimetry device, the FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human blood leukocytes for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. Studies are designed to validate and test the performance of the blood protein biomarker panel to accurately predict absorbed dose after ionizing radiation exposure. We will correlate biomarker expression levels and time kinetics with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts and bone marrow toxicity in humanized mice.","Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident",9870417,U01AI148309,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Proteins', 'Blood specimen', 'Bone Marrow', 'Burn injury', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cellular Structures', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Hematology', 'Hematopoietic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Immunoassay', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Industrial Accidents', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Injury', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Ions', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Linear Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Screening', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Accidents', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Accidents', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reaction Time', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Design', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Saliva', 'Screening procedure', 'Seeds', 'Surface Antigens', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'White Blood Cell Count procedure', 'base', 'biodosimetry', 'biomarker panel', 'biomarker performance', 'biomarker validation', 'blood damage', 'data exploration', 'design', 'dirty bomb', 'dosimetry', 'humanized mouse', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'irradiation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'medical countermeasure', 'micronucleus', 'nonhuman primate', 'nonlinear regression', 'performance tests', 'peripheral blood', 'point of care', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'protein biomarkers', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'sex', 'stem', 'stem cells']",NIAID,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2020,485237,0.025421801018835948

"In-vivo MRI-based prediction of TDP43 pathology in aging ABSTRACT Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology, a primary protein abnormality in the rare diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, is now recognized as a common age-related neuropathology, detected at autopsy in approximately 50% of older persons. According to recent evidence, TDP43 pathology in aging is associated with more rapid cognitive decline and higher odds of dementia, above and beyond contributions from Alzheimer’s and other age-related neuropathologies. In spite of its high frequency and deleterious effects, TDP43 can only be diagnosed at autopsy, and there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging. The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging by combining multimodal MRI and pathology in the same older persons from large community cohorts. Specifically, we propose to a) train TDP43 classifiers using machine learning based on ex- vivo MRI measurements of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical brain characteristics of older persons, b) translate these classifiers in-vivo, and c) test them in-vivo using longitudinal clinical, in-vivo MRI, and pathology data on older adults enrolled without dementia. We have generated a unique ex-vivo and in-vivo multimodal MRI-pathology database within the infrastructure of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG17917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), two longitudinal, epidemiologic clinical- pathologic cohort studies of aging that recruit non-demented individuals and have high follow-up rates and high autopsy rates. Using our database, we have produced compelling preliminary results in support of our aims. First, we have demonstrated that ex-vivo brain MRI data can be linked to in-vivo MRI data. Second, we show that TDP43 pathology is related to specific brain MRI characteristics independent of other age-related pathologies. Third, we show high TDP43 classification performance (AUC=0.81) based on ex-vivo MRI features in persons with as well as without comorbid Alzheimer’s pathology (a common coexisting pathology). Fourth, we demonstrate that the confidence score obtained from ex-vivo MRI classification is linked to the progression of deposition of TDP43 pathology (i.e. TDP43 stages). Finally, we translated a preliminary ex-vivo TDP43 classifier for use in-vivo and demonstrated in a small sample that it has high in-vivo classification performance, and is independently associated with lower cognition. We propose to further develop and test this promising in-vivo MRI classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology is now recognized as a common and deleterious age-related neuropathology, however, there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging, and diagnosis is only possible at autopsy. The objective of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in older community- dwelling persons with and without dementia, based on a combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical characteristics of the brain.

"Generation of parametric images for FDG PET using dual-time-point scans Project Summary/Abstract Positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET/CT) using the radiolabeled tracer 2- deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) has become a standard imaging tool for cancer patient management. The semi-quantitative parameter standardized uptake value (SUV) is routinely used in clinical for tumor uptake quantification, which is computed on the static PET image acquired at a certain time (typically 60 min) post tracer injection for a short interval (typically 5-15 min). However, the quantification accuracy of SUV from a single PET scan suffers from the variabilities of tracer plasma clearance and acquisition start time. The dual- time-point FDG PET imaging has been intensively investigated and used in both clinical and research studies, typically one scan at 60 min and the other at 120 min, showing the potential to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of FDG PET by differentiating malignancy from inflammation and normal tissue. However, the current clinical dual-time-point FDG PET studies use the relative SUV change between two scans as the quantification index, which cannot eliminate the variations in tracer plasma clearance. Meanwhile, the dual-time-point protocol has not been optimized and standardized currently, leading to conflicting results. The fully-quantitative parameter, tracer net uptake rate constant Ki, is the most accurate parameter to quantify FDG PET, which is calculated using dynamic imaging with compartmental modeling. Ki is independent on the plasma clearance or acquisition start time. However, the long and complex acquisition protocol (typically at least 60 min), which requires dynamic scanning and sequential arterial blood sampling (or image-derived blood activity) used as input function from the time of injection, limits its application in clinical practice. Meanwhile, generation of the parametric Ki image, which can provide additional heterogeneity information for FDG PET, is challenging clinically using voxel-by-voxel compartmental modeling due to the computational cost and being sensitive to noise using non-linear least squares. The graphical Patlak plot, can be used for simplified Ki calculation and Ki image generation by voxel-by-voxel fitting. However, it still needs dynamic scanning starting from 15-30 min after injection and input function from the time of injection. The aims of this proposal are 1) to optimize the dual-time-point protocol for accurate Ki quantification using Patlak plot without the need for individual patient's input function, and 2) to generate high-quality low-noise dual-time-point Ki images using novel techniques based on deep learning. Upon the success of this project, our proposed approach can obtain reliable tumor Ki quantification and parametric Ki image ""for free"" without adding any additional complexity on the existing dual- time-point protocol currently used in clinical practice, with great potential of improving diagnosis and therapy assessment in oncology. We expect the translation of this approach to clinical investigation to be fast, as this is a post-processing approach and is based on data already acquired using clinically used protocol without imposing additional burden to technologists.

"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning. Success of the project will overcome the major technical hurdles in the use of MRI in radiation therapy and will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information.

"Rapid Comprehensive Cardiac MRI Exam for Diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. The clinical gold standards to diagnose and guide treatment of patients with CAD are based on invasive catheter-based procedures, such as x-ray coronary angiography (XCA) for anatomic assessment or fractional flow reserve (FFR) for physiologic assessment. However, there are costs and risks associated with such invasive procedures. Such concerns are further highlighted by the fact that large studies have shown nearly two-thirds of patients referred for their initial elective invasive XCA were found to have no significant stenoses. Thus, better non-invasive diagnostic tools are needed. Cardiac MRI (CMR) is the only non-invasive imaging modality that provides a comprehensive assessment of CAD in a single examination, including an assessment of myocardial perfusion, cardiac function and viability, as well as angiographic evaluation of stenoses, without requiring ionizing radiation. These properties also allow for repeat testing as may be clinically indicated. However, despite its great potential to serve as the non- invasive gatekeeper for costly invasive procedures, lengthy examination times have prevented CMR from clinical translation. Although several accelerated imaging techniques have been proposed, these still require trade-offs between coverage, resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. In this proposal, we will develop and validate novel acquisition and reconstruction strategies to enable a highly accelerated high-resolution whole heart CMR exam for comprehensive CAD assessment in under 10 minutes. We will develop fast and low specific absorption rate outer volume suppression modules to reduce the source of aliasing artifacts from the chest and the back. This will enable higher rates for simultaneous multi-slice imaging in perfusion and cine CMR, improving coverage substantially with minimal noise amplification. For coronary MRI and viability imaging, simultaneous multi-slab imaging will be introduced to CMR, facilitating high isotropic resolution acquisitions with fast coverage. These acquisitions will be supplemented with regularized leakage-blocking and patient- specific machine learning reconstructions for further artifact and noise removal. Finally, we will implement and validate the proposed rapid comprehensive CMR exam in a cohort of suspected CAD patients, comparing our approach with conventional clinical CMR for the assessment of function, perfusion, and viability, and with invasive XCA for the assessment of coronary stenosis. Successful completion of this project has the potential to transform CMR into a leading rapid non-invasive tool for safe and accurate diagnosis of CAD, improving the healthcare of several million patients with chest pain and other CAD symptoms annually. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for one in six deaths. Cardiac MRI is a non-invasive non-ionizing technique for comprehensive evaluation of CAD, but its clinical translation is hampered by lengthy exam times. In this work, we will develop and validate techniques for rapid cardiac MRI in a short exam time for comprehensive CAD assessment.",Rapid Comprehensive Cardiac MRI Exam for Diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease,10030978,R01HL153146,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Anatomy', 'Award', 'Back', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinical', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Extravasation', 'Gadolinium', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'absorption', 'accurate diagnosis', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnosis standard', 'disease diagnosis', 'heart function', 'high resolution imaging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'non-invasive imaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'prevent', 'rapid technique', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,504903,0.007969777885214385
"Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT With the introduction of many novel techniques to minimize radiation dose in CT, there is still a large variation in terms of radiation dose levels prescribed in CT exams and therefore a large variation of diagnostic performance. Some patients may receive higher dose than necessary. Some may be under-dosed and mis- diagnosed as a result of insufficient image quality. In order to determine the appropriate amount of radiation dose reduction in each exam, accurate quantification of diagnostic performance is needed so that the dose reduction can be achieved without sacrificing important diagnostic information. However, currently there is a lack of efficient and quantitative tools for objective assessment of diagnostic performance, particularly for many of the novel dose reduction methods involving non-linear processing of the data such as iterative reconstruction and deep-learning-based noise reduction methods. The specific goal of this application is to disseminate a highly automated solution, CT Protocol optimization (CTPro) software, to a wide CT community. This quantitative tool provides an efficient implementation of diagnostic performance assessment and CT radiation dose optimization. This tool is based on channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), which itself was developed decades ago to mimic human observer visual responses in signal detection tasks. However, the use of CHO in clinical CT is quite limited because of a lack of rigorous validation and efficient and robust implementation in practice. We were the first to demonstrate its correlation with human observer performance in low-contrast detection, classification and localization tasks in clinical CT. The main objective of the current proposal is to optimize this tool for simplicity and robustness, and disseminate it to CT researchers and clinical users, which will be accomplished through 3 specific aims: Aim 1: Optimize CTPro for simplicity, robustness, and generalizability. Aim 2: Develop an open-source web-based platform for software dissemination. Aim 3: Build use cases and disseminate CTPro. The proposed work is significant because the software tool will allow any CT users and researchers to perform CT radiation dose optimization and diagnostic performance evaluation in an efficient, quantitative, and objective manner. This work is innovative in that the automated tool will use quantitative measures of diagnostic performance to systematically guide the complex task of CT dose optimization, moving beyond traditional metrics that are inappropriate for many novel dose reduction techniques. The software tool, once widely employed, will facilitate a paradigm shift in how dose optimization and the evaluation of dose reduction techniques are performed, and will allow a more rapid and consistent adoption of dose reduction technology into clinical practice, which will benefit millions of CT patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a lack of quantitative tools for efficient and objective assessment of diagnostic performance in CT, which is the reason why inappropriate radiation dose is frequently used in CT exams, resulting in unnecessarily high radiation exposure to patients or lose of important diagnostic information. The purpose of this project is to disseminate a highly automated solution to a wide CT community for efficient CT radiation dose optimization. If successful, appropriate amount of radiation can be prescribed for millions of CT patients at any facility, while maintaining the level of diagnostic information required for high quality patient care.",Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment,10019348,U24EB028936,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Encapsulated', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Newsletter', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computerized data processing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'open source', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'symposium', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'web site']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U24,2020,314388,0.04762028850363819
"Development of Methods for a Simplified and Reliable Prostate Cancer MRI Exam Abstract Non-invasive, multi-parametric characterization of prostate cancer (PC), with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods, is an active area of research with great potential for providing improved diagnosis and treatment monitoring. The PI-RADSv2 assessment system that was established by an international team of experts recognizes the value of quantitative images in PC diagnosis, but relies largely on qualitative evaluation of weighted images. Although this grading approach achieves reasonably good separation be- tween normal and abnormal prostate tissue, it does not achieve adequate separation between indolent and aggressive disease, with the risk that more unnecessary and costly surgery is performed with poten- tially dire consequences on patient quality of life. High-value protocols, without need for an invasive and costly endo-rectal radio-frequency coil are being investigated. This comes at the cost of extended scan time and reduced image quality in terms of spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio and signal bias, which negatively impacts sensitivity and speciﬁcity of multi-parametric MRI. With the pronounced increase of multi-parametric MRI exams, there is also the desire to integrate the support by the most recent revolution in diagnostic imaging, i.e., machine learning. It becomes increasingly clear, that in order to avoid having to train neural networks for each speciﬁc system and protocol, reproducible and thus preferably quantitative imaging protocols are essential. To overcome these limitations, we propose both pulse sequence develop- ment, investigation of ADC validity and reproducibility and novel post-processing strategies. The overall objective is to demonstrate the added value of lesion characterization with quantitative values and at the same time understand and minimize the inﬂuence of protocol choices and scan hardware, hence improve overall reproducibility. Speciﬁc Aim 1 will focus on the development of a low distortion MR imaging sequence for rapid concurrent quantiﬁcation of T2 and diﬀusion signal decay. Speciﬁc Aim 2 will examine ADC variations that result from changes in diﬀusion time over a range that is typical with present day clinical MR systems. Speciﬁc Aim 3 introduces advanced handling of low noise diﬀusion data, which will be indispensable for achieving high accuracy and precision with non-invasive and economic external coils. Speciﬁc Aim 4 introduces a novel ADC computation approach that fully captures the complex diﬀusion signal decays in tissues and at the same time is largely protocol and system independent. Moreover, re- sulting images and quantitative maps processed according this approach, exhibit considerably lower noise, which can be traded for higher spatial resolution or shorter scan duration. In combination, the consis- tently quantitative nature of the data and its ubiquitous validity and comparability will greatly facilitate the establishment of recommendations for disease-related thresholds. Ultimately this may permit much more reliable diﬀerentiation of aggressive from indolent disease. Project Narrative Magnetic resonance imaging plays an important role for staging of prostate cancer. We propose advances that permit quantitative and a more reliable assessment of prostate cancer. Potentially this will permit better diﬀerentiation of disease that is aggressive from disease that poses low risk of spreading.",Development of Methods for a Simplified and Reliable Prostate Cancer MRI Exam,9973564,R01CA241817,"['Architecture', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consequentialism', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Enrollment', 'Exhibits', 'Fingerprint', 'Image', 'Indolent', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microscopic', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualitative Evaluations', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Recommendation', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'cancer diagnosis', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'method development', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'quantitative imaging', 'radio frequency', 'rectal']",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,454234,0.0224523168821122
"Gadolinium Free Cardiac MR Imaging of Scar and Fibrosis Cardiovascular disease continues to be the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of scarred or fibrotic heart tissue plays a major diagnostic and prognostic role in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM). Cardiac MRI is a non-invasive, multifaceted imaging modality and is the clinical gold standard for scar and fibrotic cardiac tissue imaging with use of gadolinium-based contrast injection. However, administration of such gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) prolongs the scan time, increases scan cost, and is contra-indicated in patients with impaired kidney function? a highly prevalent comorbidity in CHD patients. Until recently, GBCA was presumed to be safe in patients with normal kidney function; however, there are emerging data on long-term GBCA retention in the body. We aim to develop two complimentary approaches to reduce GBCA use in myocardial, or cardiac muscle, scar imaging. Initially, we will develop a quantitative risk-benefit model to identify NICM patients with a low chance of having scarred myocardium. Concurrently, we will develop a GBCA-free cardiac MR myocardial tissue probe platform based on AI (MyoProbe.ai) to quantify scarred regions of the heart. To accomplish this, we will develop and evaluate an individualized, patient-specific scar prediction model to reduce GBCA use in NICM patients with different etiologies by training the model to learn to identify whether the patient is likely to have scarring based on non-contrast images. If it is unlikely that a patient has scarring, contrast administration can be avoided. To develop and evaluate MyoProbe.ai for GBCA-free quantification of myocardial scar in CHD patients, we will use AI to integrate signal intensity and heart motion data from MRI images to accurately locate and quantify scar tissue. This information can then be used by cardiologists to diagnose and treat the patient. We will rigorously validate our risk-benefit model and AI myocardial probe platform using retrospectively and prospectively collected cardiac MRI images from multiple healthcare centers, MRI vendors, and magnetic field strengths. Our dataset will include different types of NICM and CHD patient populations to ensure that our work is applicable to patients with many different types of NICM and CHD. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of scarred/fibrotic heart tissue with gadolinium- based contrast agents (GBCA) plays a major diagnostic and prognostic role in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM). However, administration of GBCAs prolongs the scan time, increases scan cost, contaminates surface and drinking water, is retained in the body long-term, and is contra-indicated in patients with impaired renal function– a highly prevalent comorbidity in CHD patients. The goal of our study is to reduce or eliminate GBCA use in cardiac MR scar imaging using artificial intelligence (AI) by concurrently developing a quantitative model to identify NICM patients with a low likelihood of scarring and a GBCA-free cardiac MR AI platform to quantify scar tissue.",Gadolinium Free Cardiac MR Imaging of Scar and Fibrosis,10072898,R01HL154744,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Fibrosis', 'Fostering', 'Gadolinium', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired Renal Function', 'Impairment', 'Injections', 'Ischemia', 'Kidney', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reference Standards', 'Relaxation', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Surface', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'coronary fibrosis', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'drinking water', 'heart imaging', 'heart motion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'magnetic field', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'radiomics']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,946194,0.04997232656848132
"Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of disability worldwide. The inability of non-invasive techniques to quantify disease progression has limited understanding of the pathogenesis of OA. While numerous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods have been proposed for imaging OA, sensitivity to bone metabolism has been limited. We propose to develop advanced three-dimensional PET-MRI methods for bone and soft tissue metabolism to study the response of the tissues in the joint to changes in knee load. This work will lead to a new understanding of OA pathogenesis by revealing relationships between changes in cartilage and bone metabolism over time. This project aims to develop PET-MRI methods to sensitively track changes of OA in response to biomechanical loading. Our specific aims are to (1) Develop accurate, reproducible and dose-optimized kinetic models of dynamic 18F-NaF PET-MRI for quantitative bilateral whole joint imaging using deep learning and advanced MR coil technology, (2) Study the relationship between resting state bone metabolism and biomechanics using PET- MRI and (3) Perform a longitudinal study to assess the response of our new imaging methods to changes in joint biomechanics from gait retraining. The innovation of this work lies in the development of novel imaging techniques that simultaneously offer quantitative measures of tissue physiology in cartilage and bone using PET-MRI. The significance of this work is that we will be able to sensitively and quantitatively track changes in bone metabolism and soft tissue microstructure due to changes in biomechanical loading in the knee joint over time. This will provide new and more sensitive imaging tools to assess the responses of the joint to biomechanical interventions to treat OA such as gait retraining, bracing, or high tibial osteotomy. Narrative Osteoarthritis affects more than half of the population during their lives and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Diagnostic imaging of osteoarthritis is often limited to x-ray, but more sensitive and specific imaging is a critical need for assessment of disease-modifying treatments such as bracing or gait modification. This work aims to develop novel 3D imaging approaches using positron-emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to quantitatively assess joint health during mechanical treatment of osteoarthritis. !",Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis,9997783,R01AR074492,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Arthralgia', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Matrix', 'Bone Spur', 'Bone Tissue', 'Bone remodeling', 'Canes', 'Cartilage', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fluoride Ion', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medial', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Needs Assessment', 'Orthopedics', 'Osteotomy', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sclerosis', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone', 'bone metabolism', 'cartilage metabolism', 'clinical translation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'flexibility', 'gait examination', 'gait rehabilitation', 'imaging approach', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'joint loading', 'kinetic model', 'mechanical force', 'mechanical properties', 'mineralization', 'molecular marker', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiotracer', 'response', 'soft tissue', 'subchondral bone', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'uptake']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,435694,0.0686235469510643
"Novel Algorithms for Reducing Radiation Dose of CT Perfusion Project Summary/Abstract X-ray computed tomography (CT) has been increasingly used in medical diagnosis, currently reaching more than 100 million CT scans every year in the US. The increasing use of CT has sparked concern over the effects of radiation dose on patients. It is estimated that every 2000 CT scans will cause one future cancer, i.e., 50,000 cases of future cancers from 100 million CT scans every year. CT brain perfusion (CTP) is a widely used imaging technique for the evaluation of hemodynamic changes in stroke and cerebrovascular disorders. However, CTP involves high radiation dose for patients as the CTP scan is repeated on the order of 40 times at the same anatomical location, in order to capture the full passage of the contrast bolus. Several techniques have been applied for radiation dose reduction in CTP scans, including reduction of tube current and tube voltage, as well as the use of noise reduction techniques such as iterative reconstruction (IR). However, the resultant radiation dose of existing CTP scans is still significantly higher than that of a standard head CT scan. The application of IR techniques in CTP is very limited due to the high complexity and computational burden for processing multiple CTP images that impairs clinical workflow. During the Phase 1 STTR project, we introduced a novel low dose CTP imaging method based on the k-space weighted image contrast (KWIC) reconstruction algorithm. We performed thorough evaluation in both a CTP phantom and clinical CTP datasets, and demonstrated that the KWIC algorithm is able to reduce the radiation dose of existing CTP techniques by 75% without affecting the image quality and accuracy of quantification (i.e., Milestone of Phase 1 STTR). However, the original KWIC algorithm requires rapid-switching pulsed X-ray at pre-specified rotation angles – a hardware capability yet to be implemented by commercial CT vendors. In order to address this limitation, we recently introduced a variant of the KWIC algorithm termed k-space weighted image average (KWIA) that preserves high spatial and temporal resolutions as well as image quality of low dose CTP data (~75% dose reduction) to be comparable to those of standard CTP scans. Most importantly, KWIA does not require modification of existing CT hardware and is computationally simple and fast, therefore has a low barrier for market penetration. The purpose of the Phase 2 STTR project is to further optimize and validate the KWIA algorithm for reducing radiation dose of CTP scans by ~75% while preserving the image quality and quantification accuracy in CTP phantom, clinical CTP data and animal studies. We will further develop innovative deep-learning (DL) based algorithms to address potential motion and other artifacts in KWIA, and commercialize the developed algorithms by collaborating with CT vendors. Relevance to Public Health More than 100 million CT scans are performed every year in the US, estimated to cause 50,000 cases of future cancers. This project will develop, evaluate and commercialize novel CT imaging technologies that reduce the radiation dose of existing CT perfusion techniques by ~75% without compromising imaging speed or quality.",Novel Algorithms for Reducing Radiation Dose of CT Perfusion,10006737,R44EB024438,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Animals', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Infarction', 'Location', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Rotation', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Tube', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'contrast imaging', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'low dose computed tomography', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'preservation', 'radiation effect', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement', 'voltage']",NIBIB,"HURA IMAGING, INC",R44,2020,820709,0.052902635712183725
"NeuroExplorer: Ultra-high Performance Human Brain PET Imager for Highly-resolved In Vivo Imaging of Neurochemistry Research applications of brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) have been in place for over 40 years.

The design includes high performance LYSO-SiPM blocks with small detectors, 4-mm depth-of-interaction, 250 ps time-of-flight resolution, and axial length of ~50 cm, paired with CT for attenuation correction. This design will produce a factor of 10 greater effective sensitivity than the HRRT and practical resolution of 1.5-2 mm in the human brain. The system will include built-in real-time state-of-art motion tracking cameras and will be tested using novel phantom experiments to assess the full-range of operation to validate the dramatic improvement in small- region precision and accuracy. Specific Aim 2: Algorithm Development for Fully-Quantitative Brain PET. We will develop the novel algorithms for this system. Using EXPLORER experience. we will implement reconstruction algorithms to produce dynamic images with uniform ultra-high resolution in space and time, Extending Yale’s HRRT motion correction experience, we will develop camera-based motion detection and correction algorithms to deliver ultra-high resolution human brain images. Using the carotid artery shape and geometry, we will develop methods to accurately measure blood activity to be compared to human arterial data with the goal to permit kinetic modeling without arterial sampling. We will develop noise reduction methods with machine learning to reduce dose for studying health brains and to eliminate the need for the CT scan for attenuation correction. Specific Aim 3: Human Paradigm Demonstration. With human subjects, we will evaluate specific imaging paradigms to demonstrate the effectiveness of the NX system: 1) demonstration of the dramatic sensitivity increase (with a direct comparison to the HRRT) and its impact on detection of pharmacologic effects, 2) leveraging high sensitivity to reliably measure uptake in small nuclei; and 3) opening new frontiers of imaging neurotransmitter dynamics, including dopamine and opioid release. The ultimate goal is a fully functioning and characterized system that dramatically expands the scope of brain PET protocols and applications. Human research applications of brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging have been in place for over 40 years and have led to a detailed understand of normal brain physiology including neurotransmitter dynamics and receptor pharmacology at rest and during activation. Brain-dedicated PET systems offer important advantages over currently available PET systems, but the state-of-the-art for brain PET imaging systems has not progressed beyond the 20-year-old HRRT. The proposed next generation NeuroEXPLORER (NX) PET system will have a factor of 10 greater sensitivity and will dramatically expand the scope of human brain PET protocols and applications.",NeuroExplorer: Ultra-high Performance Human Brain PET Imager for Highly-resolved In Vivo Imaging of Neurochemistry,10005604,U01EB029811,"['20 year old', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain scan', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inferior', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Noise', 'Opioid', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Physics', 'Physiology', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radioactive', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Sensory Receptors', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithm development', 'attenuation', 'base', 'body system', 'brain health', 'data quality', 'density', 'design', 'detector', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'human subject', 'imager', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'kinetic model', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'neurochemistry', 'neurotransmitter release', 'next generation', 'novel', 'operation', 'pre-clinical', 'radiotracer', 'raphe nuclei', 'receptor', 'reconstruction', 'solid state', 'statistics', 'ultra high resolution', 'uptake']",NIBIB,YALE UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,1700000,0.016498591338261773
"Noninvasive Testing of Coronary Microvascular Reactivity Using High-resolution Free-breathing MRI PROJECT SUMMARY It was long taken for granted that obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is the primary driver of angina and major adverse cardiac events. However, recent landmark studies have shown that up to 50% of the patients referred for diagnostic testing have ischemia with no obstructive CAD (INOCA). A large proportion of INOCA patients have coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), which even in the absence of flow-limiting stenoses can lead to myocardial ischemia and carries a high risk of adverse events. The reference standard for assessment of CMD is the functional coronary reactivity (CR) test, which is invasive. Despite key studies showing value of stratifying therapy based on CR testing, the practical utility of CR testing in the INOCA population is limited by its invasive nature, which carries serious risks even at experienced centers. Hence, a noninvasive approach that can detect and stage the severity of CMD would be invaluable for managing INOCA patients. Driven by this unmet need, prior studies have employed imaging approaches to index myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) against CR; however, the association shown to date between MPR and CR impairment has been weak, likely due to the suboptimal sensitivity of MPR to subendocardial myocardial blood flow (MBF) deficits which is a hallmark of CMD. Studies using invasive microsphere-based methods have established a stress subendocardial-to-subepicardial (endo-epi) MBF gradient of larger than 1.0 in healthy animals, and shown that it decreases well below 1 under abnormally elevated microvascular resistance. However, noninvasive detection of endo-epi MBF gradients using existing imaging strategies is challenging because of the need to resolve MBF transmurally. We have developed new MRI strategies aimed at overcoming key barriers for accurate evaluation of endo-epi MBF gradients and applied them in preliminary animal and patient studies. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that in the setting of CMD, impaired microvascular CR manifests as a stress-induced endo- epi MBF gradient, and the magnitude of this gradient significantly correlates with CMD severity. To test this hypothesis, we propose 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a free-breathing artifact-free MRI technique optimized for high-resolution imaging of endo-epi MBF gradients, combined with a machine learning approach for fully-automated objective quantification of MBF gradients. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity can be staged on the basis of MRI-derived stress MBF gradient in a pig model of CMD. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity in INOCA patients is highly correlated with MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. This project brings together multiple interdisciplinary investigators with a strong collective track record in developing cardiac imaging strategies to advance a noninvasive approach for determining CMD severity based on the MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. Hence the proposal is a major step towards improving the management of INOCA patients and towards imaging-guided evaluation of novel therapies aimed at CMD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent landmark studies have provided evidence that “small vessel” coronary dysfunction in patients with otherwise normal coronary arteries is a major cause of heart disease and can lead to poor health outcomes including heart failure. This research proposal seeks to develop a noninvasive approach for diagnosis and monitoring of small-vessel coronary dysfunction by developing innovative and reliable magnetic resonance imaging strategies. Our proposal has the potential to improve patient care in this population by providing a noninvasive alternative to the established invasive testing procedure, which carries a risk of complications and is only available at highly specialized medical centers.",Noninvasive Testing of Coronary Microvascular Reactivity Using High-resolution Free-breathing MRI,10037606,R01HL153430,"['Animals', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Echocardiography', 'Endothelium', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family suidae', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertrophy', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microspheres', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Nature', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Systole', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Vasodilator Agents', 'adverse event risk', 'base', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'perfusion imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'recruit', 'sequence learning']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,699398,0.03030339613862855
"Enabling Kinematic Joint Profiling Using MRI Project Summary We propose a technical feasibility study seeking to develop methods for quantitative kinematic proﬁling of moving joints using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the context of this study, a kinematic proﬁle is deﬁned as a collection of joint characteristics computed and tracked during the course of movement. This project is motivated by the hypothesis that such proﬁling of moving joints can highlight dysfunction, treatment progress, and point towards favorable (or unfavorable) surgical interventions. At a high level, it is envisioned that the proposed kinematic proﬁles could ﬁt into clinical management workﬂows much in the same way as blood biomarker panels.  While kinematic imaging of joints can be performed using plain-ﬁlm (PF) X-ray, computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound (US) methods, MRI is the gold-standard for advanced orthopedic assessment and is an appealing option for accessory kinematic analysis. A set of relatively fast kinematic proﬁling acquisitions could feasibly be added to routine orthopedic MRI exams, thereby providing optimal diagnostic imaging in both static and kinematic contexts within a single visit.  Though several preliminary studies have hinted at the potential diagnostic value of kinematic imaging data, such data is difﬁcult to interpret and cannot easily be quantiﬁed or captured in clinical records. In this study, we seek to establish fundamental methods that can provide simple and easily digestible kinematic imaging reports with data acquired in a short scan interval using conventional clinical MRI equipment.  As a preliminary feasibility investigation of these methods, kinematic imaging of the wrist will be studied. Dysfunction of the scaphoid and lunate bones in the wrist is a well-studied kinematic problem of diagnostic signiﬁcance. Novel 4D zero-echo-time MRI of the wrist will be used to capture the kinematic imaging using for proﬁling of the scaphoid-lunate mechanics during two established wrist movement patterns.  The goal of this project is to establish and demonstrate methodological components required for MRI kinematic proﬁling. Data collection on a modest-sized cohort of 100 healthy control subjects is proposed for this purpose. Novel MRI pulse-sequence and post-processing development components are introduced and tasked for analysis of this normative data. Using the acquired MRI data, kinematic parameters for each dynamic dataset will be extracted and curated into a multi-parametric proﬁle for each subject.  Aim 2 of the study proposes the use of external sensor motion capture methods to validate the MRI-based kinematic parameter measurements on 50% of the study cohort.  Finally, Aim 3 of the study seeks to use machine-learning clustering approaches to develop a kinematic proﬁle normalization procedure using the acquired control dataset. Such normalization is a crucial milestone in the translation of kinematic proﬁling to the clinic and will establish a baseline for future translational studies of symptomatic cohorts. Project Narrative We seek to develop and demonstrate fundamental methods in quantitative kinematic proﬁling using clinical diagnostic imaging equipment. This technical development project is constructed under the hypothesis that such proﬁling of moving joints can highlight dysfunction, treatment progress, and point towards favorable (or unfavorable) surgical interventions. Using currently available advanced magnetic resonance imaging technology, data collected from a controlled subject cohort will be used to develop and test the proposed kinematic proﬁling technology on the moving wrist.",Enabling Kinematic Joint Profiling Using MRI,9893679,R21AR075327,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Process', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cartilage', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Film', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Ligaments', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Population Control', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scanning', 'Scaphoid bone', 'Semilunar Bone', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Upper Extremity', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Wrist joint', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'blood perfusion', 'bone', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'heart function', 'high resolution imaging', 'human subject', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'joint mobilization', 'kinematics', 'motion sensor', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'soft tissue', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'translational study', 'volunteer', 'water diffusion']",NIAMS,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R21,2020,214720,0.05401548056661668
"Personalized dosimetry for liver cancer radioembolization using fluid dynamics simulation Project Summary/ Abstract Liver cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths with rising incidence in the U.S and worldwide. Yttrium-90 microspheres radioembolization, or Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT), is a treatment in which a catheter inserted in the patient's hepatic artery delivers radioactive 90Y microspheres to the liver. It is increasingly utilized to treat patients with unresectable liver tumors in second or third line, but some of its potential to improve overall survival is still untapped. The major obstacle in making SIRT more efficient is the treatment planning. It consists in selecting the 90Y activity to inject based on the estimated dose to the tumor and organs-at-risk. The problem is that the dose calculation is highly unreliable and does not include important parameters, such as well-known non-uniformities or the injection point. As a result, physicians often choose very conservative dosage to limit toxicity at the expense of the tumor(s) dose, which drastically reduces SIRT efficacy. The objective of this project is to develop accurate patient-specific dosimetry for SIRT planning. We propose a novel method combining computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate the 90Y microsphere 3D distribution and 90Y physics modeling to predict the absorbed dose. The central and novel approach is to carry out the CFD simulations for each patient's hepatic arterial tree to achieve high accuracy and precision, because anatomical features determining the microsphere distribution present wide variations across the patient population and prohibit the use of generic models. This novel CFD-based dosimetry will be the first comprehensive tool to integrate (1) the hepatic arterial tree extracted from the patient's standard-of-care angiogram, (2) CFD simulation in this hepatic arterial tree to predict and optimize the microsphere distribution, (3) calculation of the absorbed dose with 90Y physics modeling. Our long-term goal is developing a tool that can be integrated in clinical workflow to optimize the quantity and injection point of 90Y microspheres during SIRT planning. To this end, we will pursue two specific aims. (1) We will develop the CFD model and dose calculation using a pig model for validation; (2) we will develop a deep learning approach to simultaneously segment the hepatic artery from the standard-of-care patient angiograms and conduct a morphometric study of the obtained hepatic arterial trees to identify the principal parameters affecting the model. If successful, this project will generate a reliable, patient-specific dosimetry for SIRT providing a comprehensive calculation of the absorbed dose in individual lesions as well as in the healthy liver. This will enable high precision treatment planning to better treat the tumors with a “dose-painting” approach and ultimately improve long-term patient outcome. Narrative Liver cancer is one the most prevalent type of cancer with deadly outcome in the U.S. and worldwide. It is increasingly treated with selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) but due to severe limitations in treatment planning and dose calculation in particular, the efficacy of SIRT is drastically reduced. This work addresses this central issue by developing new dosimetry to personalize treatment planning for each patient, with the ultimate goal of improving liver cancer long-term patient outcome.",Personalized dosimetry for liver cancer radioembolization using fluid dynamics simulation,9899967,R21CA237686,"['3-Dimensional', '90Y', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Albumins', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Convolution Kernel', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distal', 'Doppler Ultrasound', 'Dose', 'Family suidae', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatic artery', 'Human', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Lesion', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radioactive', 'Radioembolization', 'Radioisotopes', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Radionuclide therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Tracer', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Trees', 'Unresectable', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer type', 'clinical implementation', 'computerized tools', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dosage', 'dosimetry', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'internal radiation', 'morphometry', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglect', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'research clinical testing', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2020,167109,-0.002884512444804643
"FAIR-CT: a practical approach to enable ultra-low dose CT for longitudinal disease and treatment monitoring Project Abstract/Summary Ultra-low dose CT, defined as sub-millisievert (sub-mSv) imaging of the entire chest, abdomen or pelvis, is critically needed for healthcare of patients with chronic diseases and cancer. Unfortunately, photon starvation and electronic noise make imaging at such dose levels challenging. Photon starvation refers to the number of transmitted photons. When no photons are transmitted, the measurement is essentially useless. If few photons are transmitted, the measurement carries information, but its interpretation and value are confounded by electronic noise. Solutions with encouraging results have been offered for sub-mSv chest imaging, but these are not widely available and not easily generalizable across anatomical sites, vendors and scanner models. We propose a novel, robust solution for ultra-low dose CT that will overcome these issues. We refer to our solution as FAIR-CT, which stands for Finite-Angle Integrated-Ray CT. FAIR-CT operates under the principle that photon starvation and the confounding effect of electronic noise are best handled by avoiding them, which is made possible by increasing the data integration time during the source-detector rotation. FAIR-CT data strongly deviate from the classical CT data model and share the streak artifact problem of sparse view sampling. FAIR-CT data acquisition also affects azimuthal resolution. We anticipate that these issues can be suitably handled using advanced image reconstruction techniques. Once available, FAIR-CT will allow improvements in longitudinal monitoring of patients with chronic diseases such as COPD, urolithiasis and diabetes, thereby reducing mortality and co-morbidities. FAIR-CT will also allow advancing cancer therapy treatments by enabling adjustments in radiation therapy plans between dose fractions without increasing CT radiation exposure, and by facilitating early detection of inflammations in drug-based therapies. To bring FAIR-CT towards fruition, we will work on two specific aims: (1) Creation of a comprehensive collection of FAIR-CT data sets enabling rigorous development, validation and evaluation of image reconstruction algorithms; (2) Development, validation and evaluation of advanced image reconstruction algorithms. The FAIR-CT data sets will involve the utilization of state-of-the-art scanners and include real patient data synthesized from high dose scans acquired for standard of care. Two complementary image reconstruction approaches will be investigated. Namely, model-based iterative reconstruction with non-linear forward model and dedicated compressed sensing regularization; and deep learning-based refinement of FBP reconstructions using target images with task-adapted image quality. Image quality evaluation will account for critical biological variables and involve objective metrics such as structure similarity and contrast-to-noise ratio for clinically-proven lesions, as well as task-based performance metrics involving human readers. Ultra-low dose X-ray computed tomography is critically needed for healthcare of patients with chronic diseases and cancer. Unfortunately, physics-related challenges and impractical solutions make this concept unavailable for everyday clinical use. We will develop a novel solution that is practical and can quickly be brought to clinical practice.",FAIR-CT: a practical approach to enable ultra-low dose CT for longitudinal disease and treatment monitoring,9877188,R21EB029179,"['Abdomen', 'Academia', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Body mass index', 'Chest', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computers', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Fruit', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Industry', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Lesion', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Noise', 'Obesity', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Photons', 'Physics', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Inflammation', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Starvation', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'clinically translatable', 'comorbidity', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'expectation', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'low dose computed tomography', 'mortality', 'novel', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'side effect', 'standard of care', 'targeted imaging', 'urolithiasis']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2020,265345,0.03466029494354155
"Rapid motion-robust quantitative DCE-MRI for the assessment of gynecologic cancers PROJECT SUMMARY  Gynecologic cancers are some of the most lethal diseases affecting women. Globally, one woman dies of cervical cancer every two minutes. MRI is increasingly used in the evaluation of gynecologic and many other cancers. Beyond its established use for cancer staging, there has long been an interest in the use of MRI-derived quantitative metrics to gain insights into the tumor microenvironment. Parametric maps obtained from quantification of dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI data can be used to study tumor vascularity and identify tumors that are better perfused and oxygenated and thus more sensitive to some treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation. However, the relative slow imaging speed and motion sensitivity of current MRI technology results in non-reliable and non-reproducible quantification of DCE-MRI data, which restricts its application in clinical practice.  Our group is a world leader in development of rapid motion-resistant DCE-MRI techniques, in particular using combinations of radial imaging and compressed sensing. We developed the technique called GRASP, which was conceived as an academic-industrial partnership and has now been successfully translated into standard clinical practice. Though powerful, the first generation of GRASP has limitations. First, radial imaging is robust to motion, but not free of motion, which usually results in blurring. Second, GRASP uses a very simple sparsifying transform for compressed sensing, which can introduce issues with quantification. Third, GRASP was not originally developed for pharmacokinetic analysis and misses important ingredients such as integration of AIF estimation and T1 mapping. Fourth, image reconstruction time is still very long – in the order of several minutes.  We have developed new advances to circumvent these limitations and offer a new DCE-MRI technique with increased speed, motion-resistance and personalized AIF estimation and T1 mapping for pharmacokinetic analysis. Following the PAR-18-009 guidelines, our main goal is to form an academic-industrial partnership between Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and General Electric Healthcare to translate these new developments in quantitative DCE-MRI for use in patients with gynecologic and other type of cancers. Specific Aims are as follows: 1. Develop and implement a fast motion-resistant quantitative DCE-MRI technique that goes beyond GRASP  to offer increased speed and resistance to motion; dynamic T1 mapping; and personalized and automated  pharmacokinetic analysis 2. Evaluate the repeatability, reproducibility and preliminary tumor response assessment of the fast motion-  robust quantitative DCE-MRI technique (“DCE-new”) and compare DCE-new to standard of care DCE-MRI  (“DCE-standard”) in patients with gynecologic cancer 3. Develop and evaluate fast image reconstruction algorithms based on deep learning PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to establish an academic-industrial partnership between Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and General Electric Healthcare to develop and disseminate advances in dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI for use in cancer patients. The new developments, which include radial imaging, compressed sensing, and deep learning, will deliver rapid motion-resistant DCE-MRI with high spatial and temporal resolution for more accurate and reproducible quantification of MRI-derived metrics. The new technology to be disseminated as a prototype on GE scanners will promote the use of quantitative DCE-MRI biomarkers in clinical practice, a long-desired goal.",Rapid motion-robust quantitative DCE-MRI for the assessment of gynecologic cancers,10052888,R01CA244532,"['Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Automation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Patient', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Early treatment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Gynecologic', 'Gynecology', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'International', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Maps', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'New York', 'Patients', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Qualitative Evaluations', 'Radial', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Speed', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'Tumor stage', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'advanced disease', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer type', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical practice', 'contrast enhanced', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'interest', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'motion sensitivity', 'new technology', 'novel', 'population based', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'standard of care', 'success', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2020,535197,0.055128682008006386
"Prostate Cancer Diagnosis by Multiparametric Ultrasound Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among American males, accounting for 20% of new cancer diagnoses, but PCa is directly responsible for only 9% of cancer related deaths. PSA screening facilitates the detection of PCa, but many of the cancers detected by PSA screening are low to intermediate grade, resulting in overtreatment of non-aggressive PCa. Recent studies suggest an urgent need to selectively identify “clinically significant” PCa that will result in cost-effective treatment of PCa. In the past few years, multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI) has become the standard of care for diagnosis of aggressive PCa. Although mp- MRI guided biopsy can selectively detect higher grade PCa lesions, several recent studies acknowledge that a considerable number of clinically important lesions are missed by mp-MRI. Furthermore, given the high cost of MRI, the geographic variability in the availability of MRI systems, the inexact methods used to register and fuse MRI with ultrasound for biopsy, and the dangers of Gadolinium in patients with renal insufficiency, there is a need for a more cost-effective, alternative to detect high-grade PCa. Recent studies have demonstrated that contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can selectively detect patients with “clinically significant” PCa. New methods have been proposed to enhance conventional ultrasound detection of PCa, including subharmonic imaging (SHI), contrast-enhanced ultrasound dispersion imaging (CUDI) and viscoelastography. The objective of this project is to develop a system capable of a multiparametric combination of ultrasound techniques (mp- US) for detection of “clinically significant” PCa. We will compare 3D mp-US and mp-MRI to identify significant PCa (defined as: Gleason score ≥ 7, a single core with > 50% involvement, or > 25% of biopsy cores positive for PCa or as Gleason grade group ≥ 2, PSA > 10 or clinical stage of cT2b or worse). The first year of the study will be dedicated to implementation of our mp-US technique on a commercially available 3D transrectal probe, and to adapting a MRI-based fusion/registration system to mp-US. During the second year, we will optimize mp-US with a machine learning approach, based upon pathologic correlation with 50 radical prostatectomy patients. The final 3 years of the study will be dedicated to a clinical trial with 300 participants suspected of having PCa. Each participant will receive an experimental intervention in the form of biopsy of up to 3 suspicious areas identified by transrectal ultrasound evaluation of the prostate with mp-US. For comparison, a maximum of 3 targeted biopsy cores will also be obtained from each participant, based on mp-MRI (the clinical intervention). Following the targeted biopsy, each participant will also receive a systematic biopsy (standard of care) consisting of 6 laterally directed biopsy cores and 6 medially directed biopsy cores. The study is powered to demonstrate that targeted biopsy based upon mp-US is not inferior to targeted biopsy based upon mp-MRI. Project Narrative This project will develop a novel, cost-effective Intervention, 3D multi-parametric ultrasound imaging (mp-US), for selectively guiding biopsies to detect clinically significant PCa in patients, and demonstrate that 3D mp-US is comparable (i.e., non-inferior) to mp-MRI (the clinical intervention). Thus, at the end of this project our partnership will deliver an accurate, 3D mp-US system ready for clinical deployment. mp-US prostate rev3 narrative DRAFT October 2, 2019 11:56 AM 1",Prostate Cancer Diagnosis by Multiparametric Ultrasound,10032625,R01CA252311,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'American', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colorectal', 'Contrast Media', 'Core Biopsy', 'Country', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elasticity', 'Engineering', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Gadolinium', 'Geography', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Histopathology', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Localized Malignant Neoplasm', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medial', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Microbubbles', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhoods', 'Ovarian', 'PSA screening', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Predictive Value', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial', 'ROC Curve', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Randomized', 'Resources', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Screening for Prostate Cancer', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure of base of prostate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transrectal Ultrasound', 'Ultrasonography', 'Viscosity', 'Visualization', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinically significant', 'contrast enhanced', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'editorial', 'effective intervention', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'male', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'overtreatment', 'portability', 'screening', 'screening program', 'socioeconomics', 'standard of care', 'technology/technique', 'treatment program', 'viscoelasticity']",NCI,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,673228,0.02193842986960968
"Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect, affecting 1.2% of all live births. Imaging plays a major role in managing CHD but remains challenging for evaluating complex cardiac and vascular abnormalities across a wide range of age and habitus. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed cardiovascular 4D flow MRI which can measure complex 3D blood flow in-vivo, a task difficult or impossible to obtain with other imaging strategies. Recent efforts have focused on two forms of CHD: 1) bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) which is the most common form of CHD, and 2) single ventricle physiology (SVP), one of the most severe forms of CHD. Our 4D flow MRI studies have successfully identified new hemodynamic biomarkers to better characterize CHD. We were the first to establish a physiologic link between aberrant 3D blood flow, elevated wall shear stress (WSS), aortopathy phenotype, and aortic wall tissue degeneration on histopathology in patients with BAV. In patients with SVP, our findings demonstrated relationships between surgical correction strategies and flow distribution to the lungs, a known factor implicated in SVP outcome. We have achieved successful clinical translation at Northwestern, where 4D flow MRI is now used as a clinical tool in diagnostic MRI exams for patients with CHD and aortic disease. Over the past four years, the PIs have assembled one of the largest 4D MRI databases with over 2500 patient exams. For this renewal application, we identified a need to increase the dynamic range of 4D MRI flow sensitivity to account for data complexity (3D + time) and the wide age range in CHD by a combination of dual-venc flow encoding, compressed sensing, and SSFP imaging. Second, three is a need for longitudinal studies to identify predictors of BAV and SVP outcome. Third, making these unique but complex 4D MRI data sets and analysis tools more widely available to the greater research community is challenging. In addition, no automated methods currently exist for advanced processing such as atlas based analysis across large cohorts. Analysis is thus time consuming and requires manual interactions (e.g. 3D vessel segmentation) which limits reproducibility and translation. To address this need, an established Northwestern data archival and pipeline processing resource based on remote high-performance computing clusters (NUNDA) will be utilized for standardized data archival, sharing, and pipeline processing of 4D MRI data. This platform will provide the unique opportunity to utilize annotated data available in the 4D MRI database (>1300 BAV, SVP, and control 4D MRI data analyzed in the initial funding cycle) for application of machine learning concepts to establish (semi-)automated 4D MRI analysis workflows in NUNDA. Thus, the renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop a rapid (15 min) non-contrast 4D MRI for clinical translation, 2) leverage the existing large 4D MRI database to identify 4D MRI metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) CHD patient outcome, and 3) establish a remote NUNDA platform for 4D MRI data sharing and automated analysis across large cohorts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop non-contrast 4D MRI, a new diagnostic test to achieve an improved assessment for the most common and one of the most severe forms of congenital heart disease: bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. We will leverage an existing large 4D MRI database to allow for long-term 5-8-year follow-up to establish new measures for improved outcome prediction and therapy management for patients with bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. A comprehensive data archive will be established to allow for the dissemination of the 4D MRI data, analysis tools, and study results to the greater research community.",Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease,9903426,R01HL115828,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Acceleration', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Aortic Diseases', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Common Ventricle', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Rate', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Oxygen', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Secure', 'Sex Differences', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'adverse outcome', 'analysis pipeline', 'aortic valve', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'clinical translation', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data archive', 'data sharing', 'data standards', 'design', 'exercise capacity', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'prevent', 'shear stress', 'spatiotemporal', 'tissue degeneration', 'tool', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,747084,0.06535072083215461
"Development of a Fast Large Area Multiphoton Exoscope (FLAME) Summary. Our long-term goal is to develop a powerful tool based on multiphoton microscopy (MPM) for non- invasive human skin imaging in order to improve clinical diagnosis, guide effective treatment and advance clinical and cosmetic/pharmaceutical research by providing access to dynamic cellular and molecular processes during therapy. MPM is a nonlinear optical imaging technique that provides unique structural and molecular contrast based on endogenous signals such as second harmonic generation from collagen and two- photon excited fluorescence from NADH/FAD+, keratin, melanin and elastin fibers. This contrast allows MPM to provide multi-color, rich molecular information content images that can enhance diagnostic accuracy. MPM overcomes fundamental limitations of existing optical imaging technologies for sub-surface skin imaging and extends the area of applicability beyond skin lesions that can be diagnosed through morphological assessment alone. Validation of the clinical potential of this technology has been facilitated over the past 10 years by a device developed by Jenlab in Germany, currently the only clinical MPM system on the market. This device has technical limitations in terms of field-of-view (FOV), imaging speed, complexity and cost, which are major barriers to clinical adoption. The goal of this Phase I proposal is to develop and test the technical feasibility for in vivo human skin imaging of a MPM system that is highly optimized for rapid, label-free, macroscopic imaging of human skin with microscopic resolution. The Fast Large Area Multiphoton Exoscope (FLAME) imaging platform will incorporate the innovative optical engine of a benchtop prototype developed at BLI. InfraDerm will innovate on this design to transform it into a compact, portable device, suitable for human skin imaging in clinical setting. Key innovations include: 1) a compact engineering design based on integrating a compact fs fiber laser into the imaging head along with a customized folded optical design to reduce complexity and cost and enhance portability; 2) hardware and software strategies that include a customized patient interface and a combination of optical and mechanical scanning mechanisms with deep learning image restoration to allow millimeter-to-centimeter scale imaging within minutes while maintaining sub-micron resolution. This approach will expand the in vivo imaging area from mm to cm scale, which will be scanned within minutes with sub- cellular resolution. In Aim 1 we will develop the FLAME prototype that incorporates these features. In Aim 2 we will test its technical feasibility for in vivo human skin imaging by evaluating potential effects of motion artifacts. In Aim 3, we will demonstrate the FLAME system potential for non-invasive assessment of melanin content, an ability with potential impact in differential diagnosis and early assessment of treatment efficacy of pigmentary skin disorders, such as melasma. Phase II will refine the technological approach and will test the device feasibility in a first clinical application, differential diagnosis of patients with melasma, a long time dermatology challenge and a particular interest for pharma companies developing therapies for this skin condition. Narrative  InfraDerm LLC proposes to develop and test the technical feasibility for in vivo human skin imaging of a laser scanning microscope based on multiphoton microscopy (MPM) that addresses fundamental and technical limitations of existing optical imaging technologies for sub-surface skin imaging, extending the area of applicability beyond skin lesions that can be diagnosed through morphological assessment alone. The proposed Fast Large Area Multiphoton Exoscope (FLAME) prototype will be highly optimized for rapid, label- free, macroscopic imaging of human skin with microscopic resolution. An MPM clinical platform, uniquely equipped with this combination of features would embody an innovative and commercially viable product that will broadly impact clinical diagnosis and research in dermatology as well as in cosmetic and pharmaceutical research.",Development of a Fast Large Area Multiphoton Exoscope (FLAME),10153566,R43EB030931,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Alopecia', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biopsy', 'Cell physiology', 'Chloasma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collagen', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Cosmetics', 'Custom', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disclosure', 'Elastin', 'Elastin Fiber', 'Excision', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Face', 'Fiber', 'Fluorescence', 'Generations', 'Germany', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Keratin', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Legal patent', 'Lesion', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Melanins', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'NADH', 'Nevus', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Pigments', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effective therapy', 'engineering design', 'human imaging', 'image guided', 'image guided therapy', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'millimeter', 'multiphoton imaging', 'multiphoton microscopy', 'optical imaging', 'portability', 'prototype', 'response', 'restoration', 'second harmonic', 'skin disorder', 'skin lesion', 'submicron', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NIBIB,"INFRADERM, LLC",R43,2020,263074,0.0008223860688401338
"Comprehensive characterization of coronary atherosclerotic disease using photon-counting-detector dual-source CT and its impact on patient management PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the main cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Cardiac CT provides fast non-invasive assessment of CAD with a high sensitivity and negative predictive value – provided that the lumen can be visualized. However, heavily calcified or stented coronary segments are non- assessable, precluding non-invasive diagnosis of flow-limiting coronary plaques in an estimated 2 million U.S. adults. In addition, the spatial resolution of state-of-the-art CT systems is insufficient for robust visualization of features associated with high risk plaques. Further, while CT can quantitatively evaluate the impact of obstructive CAD on myocardial function using dynamic perfusion imaging, this requires relatively high patient radiation doses, which has limited widespread adoption. Considering the high personal and societal cost of CAD, robust, accurate, non-invasive imaging of calcified and stented coronary arteries, high-risk plaque features, and myocardial perfusion defects in a single, low-radiation-dose exam is critically needed. Built by Siemens Healthcare, a first-of-its-kind, whole-body, photon-counting-detector (PCD) CT system was installed in 2014 at the Mayo Clinic. With support from NIH award EB016966, we showed that the increased iodine contrast-to-noise ratio, decreased electronic noise, spectral imaging capabilities, and improved spatial resolution of PCD-CT relative to commercial CT enabled us to accurately measure increased vasa vasorum density in injured swine carotid arterial walls, demonstrating the exceptional potential of PCD-CT in vascular imaging. Because this system lacks cardiac imaging capabilities, our objective is to develop and validate a PCD dual-source (DS) CT system and novel imaging algorithms to accurately assess CAD in humans, especially in patients with heavily calcified, stented, or high-risk plaques, and to identify patients with myocardial perfusion defects. Our premise is that the established benefits of PCD-CT, used with a DS geometry and advanced noise reduction and material decomposition algorithms, can meet these objectives. Our proposal is significant in many ways: the technology developments will benefit all of CT imaging; robust, accurate, non-invasive imaging of calcified and stented coronary arteries, high-risk plaque features, and myocardial perfusion defects in a single, low-radiation-dose exam will obviate the need for additional imaging, reducing the overall time and cost to comprehensively evaluate CAD and its clinical significance. To extend the demonstrated benefits of PCDs to cardiac CT will require numerous physics, engineering, and algorithm innovations, including novel noise reduction and material decomposition algorithms using energy, spatial and temporal domain redundancies, as well as deep learning. These advances will culminate in a large clinical study to demonstrate not merely that the images are “better,” as is so often done, but that PCD-DSCT provides clinically-significant improvements in the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected CAD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop a new type of cardiac computed tomography (CT) scanner that is able to comprehensively assess coronary artery disease in humans. This technology, known as photon-counting- detector dual-source CT, is capable of exceptional spatial and temporal resolution, multi-energy spectral imaging and reduced radiation doses, allowing it to image the coronary artery and myocardium with unparalleled quality. This will enable comprehensive assessment of coronary artery anatomy and myocardial function from a single imaging exam, reducing time to diagnosis and cost, while also improving patient diagnosis and management.",Comprehensive characterization of coronary atherosclerotic disease using photon-counting-detector dual-source CT and its impact on patient management,9972330,R01EB028590,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Award', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computed Tomography Scanners', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Defect', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Equipment', 'Family suidae', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Iodine', 'Lesion', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Stents', 'Sudden Death', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithm development', 'calcification', 'clinically significant', 'coronary plaque', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'detector', 'heart imaging', 'heart motion', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'photon-counting detector', 'routine practice', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'societal costs', 'spectral energy', 'spectrograph', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'vasa vasorum']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,628053,0.03442758021818501
"Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification Project Abstract Motivation: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 500 million people. Children commonly develop CKD from urinary obstructive diseases and nephrotoxic therapies, and then suffer severe growth failure,  hypertension, cardiovascular risks, and neurocognitive deficits, and eventually end-stage kidney disease. Accurate renal function quantification will improve clinical management of hydronephrosis (1 in 100 babies) and  dosing/selection of chemotherapeutic regimens in oncology patients. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the biomarker of renal function, is derived from blood or urine tests. These tests only provide global GFR and are limited in accuracy, especially in children, and even more so in children with cancer. MRI offers superb anatomic delineation without ionizing radiation, and is thus ideal for pediatric kidney imaging. However, MRI has not been widely adopted for pediatric renal function evaluation due to lack of reliability and cumbersome workflow. These hurdles stem from the fact that the critical components required for global and regional GFR calculation, including high spatiotemporal resolution, plasma flow and arterial input function, are difficult to obtain, and that accurate image segmentation of kidneys (cortex and medulla) is labor intensive. Additionally, although the same contrast agent injection can be used for obstruction evaluation, certain areas of the kidney suffer from significant signal loss using standard MRI acquisition techniques due to high contrast agent concentrations. This project addresses these major challenges for automated comprehensive renal function evaluation in children. Approach: The project has three development aims, which are validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable novel free-breathing time-resolved 3D dynamic contrast enhanced MRI that simultaneously provides accurate GFR calculation and renal plasma flow. This is achieved by incorporating self-navigated motion compensation, fast acquisition with parallel imaging and compressed sensing, and phase-contrast flow imaging. The second aim is to develop multiple new image analysis methods to extract GFR and renal plasma flow (RPF) that  leverage novel flow data of Aim 1, as well as automated new machine-learning image processing techniques for the segmentation of kidneys and ultimately global and regional GFR calculation. In Aim 3, we will develop and integrate ultrashort-echo-time techniques to address the MRI signal loss due to T2* effects from high contrast concentration for patients with obstruction, and further incorporate motion compensation and accelerated  imaging methods to enable time-resolved high-resolution dynamic MRI for contrast washout kinetics analysis in the same MR exam. Aim 4 will determine the performance of these methods in a clinical setting. Significance: This work will lead to robust, automated comprehensive pediatric renal MRI for safer and more accurate renal function evaluation in children. The techniques will facilitate widespread application in the com- munity setting and permit robust evaluation of renal function, for both children and adults. Project Narrative Kidney diseases in children often stem from blockages of the urinary tract or toxicity from medications, such as antibiotics or chemotherapies. Kidney function quantification is crucial for clinical management of these children.

"Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology using 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography Each year, 735,000 Americans have an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), and approximately 120,000 die from it. Heart attacks occur most commonly due to rupture of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries. Despite this, current diagnostic and treatment algorithms make no allowance for the assessment of disease activity and currently all patients with atherosclerosis are treated in a similar manner. This failure to differentiate stable from active disease may result in potentially unnecessary or insufficient therapies. In a breakthrough series of studies, our co-investigators discovered that positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-sodium- fluoride (18F-NaF; an inexpensive and widely available tracer approved by Food and Drug Administration) can readily identify plaque rupture and increased coronary plaque activity. We propose to build further on this success, by addressing several important remaining limitations that prevent us from translating this technology to broad clinical use. The limitations include complicated and subjective image analysis, underutilization of the concomitant coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) for plaque characterization, inability to utilize prior CTA for the analysis of 18F-NaF PET, lack of methods to integrate all available PET and CTA data and significant motion of the coronaries during the PET scan. We propose a multi-faceted approach to automate and improve coronary 18F-NaF PET imaging by full integration with CTA and correction for cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion. The overall goal of the proposal is to optimize the measurement of disease activity in coronary atherosclerosis using integrated 18F-NaF PET/CTA imaging, with the opportunity to validate this development against clinical outcome in a “real-world” multicenter patient study. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: 1) to integrate quantification of CTA and PET image data 2) to develop new methods for simultaneous correction of cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion for coronary PET, and 3) to clinically evaluate new methods in a multicenter clinical trial (separately funded and already underway), further refining risk prediction for heart attacks with integrated PET+CTA risk score derived by machine learning. This work will lead to a robust and reproducible clinical method for stratification of patients for risk of heart attacks, with potential to be applied for the identification of patients who would most benefit from expensive, and potentially risky treatments. Our techniques could also be used in future clinical trials to test the efficacy of novel therapies. Moreover, the new analysis will be applicable to other PET tracers that may be developed to investigate other pathological processes in the coronary vasculature. The resulting software will be shared with clinical institutions performing coronary PET to facilitate standardization and automation of this novel plaque imaging technique. NARRATIVE A heart attack, a major cause of death, is most commonly caused by rupture of deposits in heart vessels, leading to sudden blockage of the blood flow in the vessels and disruption of blood supply to the heart muscle. Currently there is no reliable test to identify deposits at the highest risk of rupture, but in a recent scientific breakthrough, positron emission tomography has demonstrated capability to image disease activity inside these deposits, linked to their rupture; this technique, however, is currently hampered by lack of anatomical reference, image blurring due to heart motion, and variability of manual analysis. We propose to address these problems by developing automatic software that precisely integrates anatomical and biological information and virtually “freezes” vessel motion, validating this new approach in a large “real-world” multicenter patient study.",Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography,10015326,R01HL135557,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Blood flow', 'Breast Microcalcification', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Failure', 'Fluorides', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammation', 'Institution', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Translating', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'atherosclerotic plaque rupture', 'automated analysis', 'coronary computed tomography angiography', 'coronary plaque', 'coronary vasculature', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'heart motion', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'success', 'uptake', 'virtual']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,666434,0.06703833209830713
"Rapid Low-Cost Quantitative 3D MRI and Gait Assessment of the Knee Project Abstract Motivation: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful disease that affects tens of millions of Americans, but is poorly understood, resulting in a lack of treatments. Enabling low-cost approaches for widespread study of risk factors, onset and early progression of OA will enable better understanding of OA mechanisms, treatment development, and triage of patients to different treatments based on speciﬁc disease phenotypes. Multiple systemic factors, biochemical factors, and other risk factors are associated with OA, but causes are difﬁ- cult to isolate and study during slow progression. Currently OA is diagnosed as joint-space narrowing using X-ray radiography, at a stage well beyond when interventions can be effective. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of- fers sensitivity to morphologic and biochemical changes, but most methods are impractical for widespread clinical or research use. Usually MRI exams study only one knee, precluding the opportunity to compare knees. Sim- ilarly, biomechanics assessment typically requires numerous tests using advanced and rarely-available equip- ment and time-intensive analysis by skilled personnel, making this a challenge for widespread use. We have shown rapid, simultaneous 3D scanning of both knees with quantitative relaxometry and diffusion map- ping of connective tissues, combined with novel visualization of longitudinal change validated in a population with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. We have developed fully-automated cartilage and meniscus seg- mentation to simplify post-processing. (Our automated cartilage segmentation variability approaches that of reader-to-reader variability.) We now propose to combine MRI acquisition, reconstruction and analysis tech- niques with simple measures of kinematics into a widely applicable low-cost imaging and biomechanical test, which we will validate in subjects with ACL-injury and subjects with varying Kellgren-Lawrence grades of OA. Approach: We will begin by developing a robust 5-to-8-minute bilateral knee MRI exam, using an efﬁcient 3D isotropic acquisition and novel deep-learning based image reconstructions. This will be followed with automated cartilage segmentation and quantitative analysis (thickness, T2, diffusion) of all 3 knee plates and automated semiquantitative scoring approaches for synovitis, bone marrow and cartilage lesions. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) will be used to measure kinematics, and gait asymmetries. We will continue our studies in ACL pa- tients to validate techniques and to develop asymmetry analyses for both imaging and biomechanical measures. Finally, in subjects with varying OA grade, we will evaluate the potential of the overall low-cost approach to relate asymmetry and longitudinal change measures to progression and OA grade. Signiﬁcance: This project will develop an acquisition and analysis pipeline to quantify knee changes and left/right asymmetries that precede OA. We will characterize methods in idiopathic OA subjects and ACL- injured subjects at risk of post-traumatic OA. The very low target cost, under $120/subject, will ultimately enable widespread study of early onset and progression of different OA types, leading to earlier and better treatments. Project Narrative Osteoarthritis remains the leading cause of disability, and effective treatment will require efﬁcient assessment of disease risk-factors, onset, and progression, both for development and personalization of minimally invasive interventions. We propose a 5-minute 3D MRI exam of both knees without radiation or contrast injection, that will be combined with low-cost measures of knee motion and fully automated analysis methods to provide quan- titative measurements of cartilage, tendon, ligament, bone and ﬁbrocartilage health and asymmetries between knees. This low-cost, rapid, bilateral assessment will enable research studies in large populations, as well as adding quantitative bilateral information to clinical scans to dramatically improve understanding of onset of dif- ferent types of osteoarthritis.",Rapid Low-Cost Quantitative 3D MRI and Gait Assessment of the Knee,10032904,R01AR077604,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anterior Cruciate Ligament', 'Articulation', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Body mass index', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Spur', 'Cartilage', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Connective Tissue', 'Cost Measures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Fibrocartilages', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Gait abnormality', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammatory', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kellgren-Lawrence grade', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Left', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Ligaments', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Slice', 'Surface', 'Synovitis', 'Techniques', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Visualization', 'analysis pipeline', 'anterior cruciate ligament injury', 'anterior cruciate ligament rupture', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bone', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'gait examination', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'kinematics', 'learning classifier', 'meniscus injury', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'predictive test', 'primary outcome', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'sensor', 'societal costs', 'therapy development', 'tissue biomarkers']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,658342,0.029271120132425187
"Multiband ASL for Neurodevelopment Study Project Summary/Abstract The developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood is marked by a mix of potential and vulnerability. A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during this critical period, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and the first signs of emotional disorders. It is important to understand detailed patterns of typical development, so alterations can be identified and rectified as early as possible. As an entirely noninvasive and quantitative imaging method, arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI is increasingly being recognized as an important biomarker for functional brain development in both healthy populations and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, there remain significant challenges for making ASL an impactful tool in studying neurodevelopment, including: 1) a coarse spatial resolution of ~4x4x4mm3, 2) susceptibility to head motion with segmented 3D acquisitions, and 3) potential confounding effects of age dependent variations in arterial transit time using a single post-labeling delay (PLD) scan. Simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) or multiband (MB) is a new accelerated imaging technology that simultaneously excites multiple slices and recovers each slice with parallel imaging techniques. Preliminary studies combining MB with ASL showed that MB can reduce T1 relaxation of the label, improve spatial coverage and/or resolution compared to those of standard 2D ASL. MB imaging may also overcome the limitation of 3D ASL acquisitions in terms of head motion and spatial blurring. However, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of existing MB ASL is inferior to that of 3D ASL. This project builds on two recent innovations from our lab: 1) a constrained slice-dependent (CSD) background suppression (BS) technique that improves the SNR of 2D MB pCASL to be comparable to that of 3D pCASL; and 2) a single-shot 3D GRASE pCASL method with 2D CAIPIRINHA accelerations that improves the imaging speed of 3D pCASL. The goal of this R01 project is to develop and evaluate cutting-edge MB pCASL protocols that are able to offer a high spatial resolution of isotropic 2mm or higher, resistance to head motion and multi-delay capability for accurate perfusion quantification in pediatric populations. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based denoising algorithm for multi-delay MB pCASL will be further developed. The developed suite of MB pCASL protocol and post- processing algorithms will be evaluated in 40 typically developing children and adolescents. The successful completion of this R01 project will lead to a robust multi-delay MB pCASL protocol that is highly valuable as potential biomarker for both neurodevelopment research and pediatric clinical care. To maximize the scientific and clinical impact, we will continue disseminating the pulse sequence and associated post-processing software as we have been doing in the past decade. Relevance to Public Health A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during the developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and emotional disorders.

"Development and Dissemination of Clinical CEST MRI Acquisition and Analysis Methods for Cancer Imaging Applications This research plan will continue our development of Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI acquisition and analysis methods for imaging patients with cancer. AcidoCEST MRI with an exogenous contrast agent is an innovative variation of this technique that measures extracellular pH in solid tumors. We have also developed an exceptionally innovative method that acquires endogenous CEST MR images with multiple powers, which can measure the chemical exchange rate of endogenous proteins that can assess relative differences in pH. We will improve our CEST MRI acquisition methods by accelerating the imaging speed, reducing and eliminating complications due to patient motion, eliminating complications caused by fat signal, and expanding to 3D imaging methods. We will also improve image analysis methods that are required for CEST contrast from endogenous proteins and exogenous contrast agents.  Our research has strong impact because acidoCEST MRI can track changes in tumor acidosis in response to chemotherapy and chemoradiation therapy in patients who have breast cancer and head & neck cancer. Endogenous CEST MRI can improve the diagnoses of brain tumor recurrence vs. pseudoprogression, and evaluations of lung cancer vs. lung infection. We will perform clinical studies with our endogenous and exogenous CEST MRI methods to image patients with brain, breast, lung, and head & neck cancers.  To amplify the impact of our research, we will develop versions of our CEST MRI acquisition methods for the many versions of the 13 Siemens hardware platforms and software operating systems at the MD Anderson Cancer Center. We will also develop user-friendly CEST analysis methods for many researchers at MD Anderson. We will leverage our unique research environment and expertise with intra-institutional dissemination to provide inter-institutional dissemination, by sharing share these acquisition and analysis tools with other CEST MRI researchers. We will collaborate with NIST to provide the first CEST MRI phantom that can standardize the development and implementation of intra- and inter-institutional CEST MRI methods.  Our team of outstanding investigators includes experts in CEST saturation methods, CEST MR image analysis, clinical contrast agents, rapid MRI acquisition methods, high field 7T MRI, clinical radiology, biostatistics, histopathology and oncology. Based on our expertise and years of productivity in clinical CEST MRI, we have developed an exceptional research approach. As the world's largest cancer center and a health destination, the MD Anderson Cancer Center has the patient population that provides very strong institutional support for our clinical studies. NARRATIVE We will develop new acquisition and analysis methods that assess tumor acidosis with CEST MRI, using exogenous CEST agents and endogenous sources of CEST contrast. We will apply our new methods to evaluate tumor acidosis in patients with breast, head & neck, lung, and brain cancers.

"Serial evaluation of cardioprotective effects of exercise training in heart failure using cardiac diffusion tensor MRI Project Summary / Abstract  Heart failure (HF) is accounts for 1 in 9 deaths in the United States and currently affects ~6 million with a prevalence of 250,00-400,000 and incidence of 70,000-120,000. Current therapy does not address the underlying loss of functional heart muscle and adverse structural remodeling. One novel potential treatment of HF is exercise (aerobic) therapy that has demonstrated various cardioprotective properties to halt and potentially reverse adverse structural remodeling. However, dosing of exercise therapy remains a challenge due to each individual's inherent differences and consequentially, serial non-invasive monitoring of the therapy would be necessary to evaluate the change on structural remodeling. Furthermore, current non-invasive technologies characterize structural remodeling with surrogate measures and thus, there is no consensus on a single clinical gold-standard. Without a tool to monitor and characterize the degree of structural remodeling, the evaluation of the therapeutic potential of exercise therapy in HF patients cannot be fully realized representing an unmet need in ultimately improving therapy. The proposed project aims to improve the therapy monitoring of exercise training to cardioprotect against HF by revealing its effect on microstructural remodeling with cardiac diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI). DT-MRI is a unique, non-invasive technology capable of characterizing myocardial fiber orientation and directly reflecting microstructural remodeling. However, despite major advances, there are fundamental challenges that limit the capability of current cardiac DT-MRI methods to be applied robustly in a clinical setting. In this project, an innovative 5-min “push button” DT-MRI method will be developed that overcomes such limitations. We also leverage institutional strengths to further quantify the accuracy of in vivo DT-MRI in revealing myocardial microstructure using novel tissue cleared 3D histology. The central hypothesis is that addressing these major technical challenges will allow for clinical translation of cardiac DT-MRI to serve as a tool to monitor the therapeutic effects of HF on microstructural remodeling. This is achieved by extending previously developed technologies used for myocardial fibrosis detection with diffusion-weighted MRI. The proposed project is designed to systematically develop an innovative and robust clinical DT-MRI methodology and rigorously validate in a pre-clinical setting the effects of exercise therapy on the microstructural remodeling of HF thereby laying the groundwork for potential optimization of dosing exercise therapy. Project Narrative This project ultimately aims at optimizing the non-invasive monitoring of exercise therapy in heart failure patients to potentially improve outcome. The research strategy is designed to systematically develop an innovative cardiac diffusion tensor MRI method that overcomes major shortcomings of the conventional methods and aims at immediate clinical translation. Successful completion of this project will result in a clinically robust cardiac diffusion tensor MRI method that can effectively monitor the efficacy of exercise therapy and potentially improve treatment of heart failure.",Serial evaluation of cardioprotective effects of exercise training in heart failure using cardiac diffusion tensor MRI,9946164,R01HL151704,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Aerobic', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Architecture', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cell Therapy', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Consequentialism', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Echocardiography', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Therapy', 'Exhibits', 'Family suidae', 'Fiber', 'Financial compensation', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Histology', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Pacemakers', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prevalence', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'RNA marker', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Pathway', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Tachycardia', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'cardioprotection', 'clinical translation', 'clinically translatable', 'cohort', 'coronary fibrosis', 'denoising deep learning', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exercise training', 'functional loss', 'heart function', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'preservation', 'prognostic tool', 'prognostic value', 'reconstruction', 'sedentary', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,673600,0.04742170139487117
"Advancing MRI technology for early diagnosis of liver metastases PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Liver is commonly involved in metastatic disease in colorectal cancer (CRC) and knowledge about the presence and location of these tumors affects treatment decisions. In patients with CRC, surgical or ablative treatment of liver metastases improves overall survival. Early diagnosis of colorectal metastases (i.e. while lesions are small) is expected to improve treatment outcomes by increasing the number of subjects that can undergo surgical resection or by identifying subjects early on, when non-surgical options are an alternative treatment. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is regarded as the most effective imaging modality for the detection and characterization of liver neoplasms; T2-weighted (T2w) and T1-weighted (T1w) images - combined with administration of a gadolinium chelate agent and multi-phase dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) - are the foundational acquisitions used for the detection and characterization of liver tumors. However, challenges remain for the detection and characterization of small lesions due to factors including inadequate spatial resolution, partial volume effects, physiological motion, and variations in timing of contrast arrival in DCE imaging. In this academic-industrial partnership the scientific and engineering teams at the University of Arizona and Siemens Medical Solutions are coming together to develop robust radial MRI techniques for T2w/T2 mapping and DCE imaging of the liver to improve detection and characterization of small tumors with the goal of bringing these techniques to routine clinical practice. The proposed work is based on a radial turbo spin-echo technique pioneered by the team at the University of Arizona for abdominal imaging and a radial stack- of-stars technique with continuous acquisition for DCE imaging. The specific aims of the partnership are: Aim 1: To develop radial T2w acquisition and reconstruction techniques with efficient full coverage of the liver for small tumor detection and accurate T2 quantification for tumor characterization. Aim 2: To implement a self-navigated 3D radial stack-of-stars technique for continuous acquisition of DCE data and retrospective reconstruction of the dynamic phases. Aim 3: To conduct a clinical evaluation of the techniques from Aims 1 and 2 against conventional T2w and DCE techniques. Aim 4: To streamline translation of the new radial methods to the clinic by developing a computationally efficient reconstruction pipeline. The endpoints of our study include technical advances in MRI acquisitions that markedly overcome limitations of current liver MRI for the diagnosis of early metastases. We expect our proposal to yield technology improvements that will increase precision of care and outcomes in patients with metastatic malignancies, in particular those with colorectal cancer.

"Accurate quantification of kidney function with non-sedated motion-compensated pediatric MRI Project Summary: Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is an impairment of urine flow from the renal pelvis into the proximal ureter and is the most common cause of hydronephrosis in neonates. This disorder is detected in up to 7% of all maternal ultrasound scans, and an estimated 10% of these newborns have hydronephrosis, which, if left untreated, may result in early failure of functional renal development in these patients. Current methods of assessing kidney function in neonates and children are less than optimal, however. While the current reference standard, nuclear renography (MAG3), yields some useful diagnostic information; it is invasive, slow, provides low resolution, does not offer anatomic detail, and delivers potentially harmful ionizing radiation. Thus, there is an urgent, unmet need to develop a method for functional imaging of kidneys that is non-invasive, safe, accurate, reproducible and radiation-free. The primary objective of this exploratory, two-year study, therefore, is two-fold: first, to develop advanced methods of motion-compensated, high spatial and temporal resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the improved quantification of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), an important marker of renal function; and second, to demonstrate the superiority of this method over the current reference standard, nuclear renography (MAG3). Our application in response to PAR-18-743 is specifically aimed at developing, and evaluating motion-robust, high spatiotemporal resolution dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) for quantifying GFR (MR-GFR) as well as creating new automated analysis software to enable the robust and reproducible assessment of differential renal function in newborns eliminating need for sedation, and in older children. Our method will overcome the technical challenges of current DCE-MRI techniques providing high temporal resolution to capture fast arterial input function dynamics required for accurate computation of GFR, compensate for unavoidable respiratory and bulk motion to reconstruct high quality images and will provide robust, fast, automated post processing techniques for accurate GFR computation. As a non-invasive, motion-robust, radiation-free imaging technique that can depict renal structures at much higher resolution, MR-GFR will offer, for the first time, a level of diagnostic information that is unattainable with MAG3. The critical importance of understanding the extent and severity of UPJO (and resulting hydronephrosis) cannot be understated; for in the absence of this information, children who stand to benefit from immediate surgery might be overlooked or delayed in receiving treatment; and those who might benefit from a more conservative approach (i.e., watching waiting) might receive an unnecessary surgical intervention. Indeed, this novel imaging approach is expected to substantially improve clinical decision-making. The successful completion of our aims will enable 1) assessment of renal function accurately; 2) predicting the likelihood of functional decline; and 3) determining whether surgery is indicated. DCE-MRI is expected to have rapid translational impact for several diseases effecting kidney function once it is introduced into clinical practice. Project Narrative: This project addresses the need to develop advanced methods of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess kidney function in newborns and in older children who have been diagnosed with ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO), an impairment of urine flow that is the most common cause of hydronephrosis (inability to void urine). Unfortunately, severe hydronephrosis, left untreated, can result in permanent damage to the child's kidneys and our novel method of assessing kidney function, dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), promises to evaluate the extent of this disorder in a way that is highly accurate, non- invasive, safe, reliable, and radiation-free and will eliminate the need of repeated scans, sedation and anesthesia when imaging newborns with congenital hydronephrosis. Most importantly, this approach will enable the clinician to confidently and quickly refer children for corrective surgery based on imaging results; and likewise, recommend other children for more conservative “watchful-waiting”, effectively reducing the number of unnecessary surgeries.",Accurate quantification of kidney function with non-sedated motion-compensated pediatric MRI,9877232,R21DK123569,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age-Months', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drainage procedure', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Free Will', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gadolinium', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Hospitalization', 'Hydronephrosis', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Infection', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Function Tests', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Liquid substance', 'Lower urinary tract', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Nephrectomy', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nuclear', 'Obstruction', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pain', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Pentetic Acid', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Reference Standards', 'Renal function', 'Renal pelvis', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sedation procedure', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Ultrasonography', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Ureter', 'Ureteropelvic junction obstruction', 'Urine', 'Urology', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated algorithm', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bulk motion', 'care costs', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep neural network', 'functional decline', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kidney imaging', 'kinetic model', 'neonate', 'neural network algorithm', 'novel', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'renal artery', 'respiratory', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement', 'translational impact', 'urologic']",NIDDK,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2020,221250,0.04789368339372935
"Risk Assessment of Cerebral Aneurysm Growth with 4D flow MRI PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this project is to determine the contribution of hemodynamic factors to risk assessment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) and calculate these factors from enhanced in vivo 4D flow MRI data. Even though most UIAs are stable, the majority of UIA patients are offered interventional treatment due to the grave risk presented if an aneurysm ruptures. Previous studies indicated that in addition to clinical (e.g., age, sex, comorbidities) and morphological (e.g., location and size) factors, UIA progression is affected by local blood flow dynamics. Hemodynamic factors associated with UIA growth can be obtained from computational and experimental models or from 4D flow MRI measurements; however, each approach has limitations. The previous NIH-funded project focused on developing image-based computational methods for predicting postoperative flow following interventions. The goal of this renewal is to use the developed framework to improve risk stratification of UIAs using image-based flow analysis. The proposed project will develop multi-parametric predictive models that combine clinical and morphological factors with hemodynamic factors calculated from augmented 4D flow MRI data. The UIA growth predicted by different models will be compared to outcomes observed in longitudinal imaging studies. The aims of the proposed project are, therefore, to: (1) determine the probability of UIA growth by utilizing morphological and clinical factors together with hemodynamic factors obtained from computational and experimental flow models by a) performing statistical analysis based on morphological and clinical factors obtained from longitudinal imaging, and b) extending statistical model by including hemodynamic factors computed from patient-specific models; (2) Enhance 4D flow MRI data by a) determining 4D flow reproducibility and variability with in vitro studies, and b) applying advanced data augmentation methods to improve the accuracy of calculated hemodynamic factors affecting aneurysm growth; (3) determine the probability of UIA growth based on multi-parametric analysis utilizing hemodynamic factors calculated from enhanced 4D flow MRI. Successful completion of the project will resolve the controversy regarding how hemodynamic factors affect aneurysm growth and establish 4D flow MRI as a diagnostic tool for UIA risk stratification. This collaborative project engages the cardiovascular engineering group at Purdue University and neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists and MRI physicists at Northwestern University, University of California San Francisco and Barrow Neurological Institute. This cross-disciplinary team will bring together experts in neurovascular surgeries, MRI velocimetry, patient-specific flow computations, experimental fluid mechanics and statistical analysis. Retrospective and prospective UIAs data obtained from these superb clinical centers will be used in this study. The outstanding engineering resources available at Purdue and world-class imaging resources at Northwestern, UC San Francisco and Barrow, as well as existing the data sharing agreements between these institutions and ongoing collaborations between the PIs, will ensure the project's success. PROJECT NARRATIVE The majority of brain aneurysms are treated, despite the fact that most of them have very low risk or rupture. Studies indicated that brain aneurysm risk factors include a range of clinical (e.g., patient’s age, sex, family history) and anatomical (e.g., aneurysm location, size and shape) parameters, as well as local blood flow dynamics. The proposed studies will determine the specific contribution of blood flow variables for improving the risk assessment of brain aneurysms and examine whether these variables can be reliably calculated from flow velocities measured with phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging.",Risk Assessment of Cerebral Aneurysm Growth with 4D flow MRI,10052679,R01HL115267,"['4D MRI', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Aneurysm', 'Angiography', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Brain Aneurysms', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cerebral Aneurysm', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Experimental Models', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Aneurysm', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Multiparametric Analysis', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Postoperative Period', 'Probability', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Aneurysm', 'San Francisco', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Velocimetries', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical center', 'clinical risk', 'comorbidity', 'data sharing', 'enhancing factor', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'neurovascular', 'novel strategies', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'residence', 'serial imaging', 'sex', 'shear stress', 'success', 'tool']",NHLBI,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,707635,0.0220527757292547
"3-D Imaging Flow Cytometry PROJECT SUMMARY This project aims to develop and test two innovative platforms and related software for 3-D imaging flow cytometry of fluorescent or absorbing (stained) samples. These systems will allow 3-D structural and functional imaging of many single cells at a subcellular resolution and at a scale that used to be available only in flow cytometry or recently in 2-D imaging. Thereby, the proposed methods have the potential to fundamentally change the ways cultured cells, patient-derived samples, and small experimental organisms are studied. Automated classification based on the 3-D features will enable the diagnosis of hematologic disorders at single-cell precision. Existing 3-D microscopy methods can provide the same information at higher resolution; however, by relying on a scanning mechanism they cannot be applied to suspending cells, especially in a flow configuration, which is essential for high-speed interrogation. Snapshot 3-D microscopy techniques have been developed to address this challenge, but they have insufficient spatial resolution for single-cell imaging and suffer from long data processing time. We overcome these limitations by combining two novel snapshot techniques developed by the PI with the most rigorous optical imaging theories and cutting-edge component technologies. We will use an array of lenslets, which simultaneously records many projection images corresponding with different viewing angles. The use of pupil phase masks, designed using wavefront coding and a theory of 3-D high-numerical-aperture optical imaging, will increase the resolution of each projection image to the theoretical limit given by the objective-lens numerical aperture. The target resolution is 0.5 µm, which is comparable to existing 2-D imaging flow cytometry systems. The target imaging throughputs based on current component technologies are 120 volumes/sec for fluorescence imaging and 700 volumes/sec for absorption imaging, which are higher than 100 volumes/sec of cutting-edge 3-D optical microscopy for stationary specimens. The vast amount of data acquired by these 3-D imaging systems imposes a serious challenge to data processing. The developed systems record true projection images, which obviate iterative deconvolution process, thereby allowing much faster tomographic reconstruction than in existing snapshot techniques. Using general-purpose graphics processing units and optical diffraction tomography, which includes the diffraction of light by subcellular organelles, our tomographic reconstruction algorithm will be faster yet more accurate than existing approaches. Further, we will explore the feasibility of applying a deep convolutional neural network to the images acquired by the developed systems for accurate single-cell classification based on 3-D features. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to develop 3-D imaging flow cytometry platforms for fluorescent or absorbing (stained) cells at high resolution and high throughput in a flow configuration. The developed systems will be built upon two novel snapshot 3-D techniques developed by the PI in combination with most rigorous 3-D optical imaging theories and cutting-edge component technologies.

"Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop a framework for high-performance parallel transmission (pTx) that is trans- ferable to a wide range of MRI scanners, and apply it to push the spatial encoding limits of echo planar imaging (EPI) at 7 Tesla. EPI is by far the most widely used pulse sequence for rapid functional, diffusion, and perfusion imaging, and has been the focus of considerable development in recent years to increase its speed and spatial resolution. Now there is a strong desire to push EPI's spatial resolution down to the micro scale. For functional MRI (fMRI), this would enable imaging of ﬁne structures (layers, columns, and nuclei) of cortical and subcortical architecture while better resolving the hemodynamic response. For diffusion MRI (dMRI), micro scale EPI would improve surface and laminar analysis of ﬁbers in the cortex, as well as brain parcelation using fractional anisotropy differences between gray matter regions, while broadly reducing partial volume effects. It would further enable EPI to be broadly applied to accelerate anatomic scans that are geometrically matched to fMRI and dMRI scans. However, increasing the resolution of single-shot EPI requires longer readouts which extend echo times and re- duce functional contrast in fMRI and signal-to-noise in dMRI at 7 Tesla, while increasing geometric distortions and blurring. Segmented or multishot EPI is a classic method to increase spatial resolution without increasing readout durations, but is underutilized, primarily due to its high sensitivity to motion and dynamic phase changes between shots which cause large image artifacts.  We propose to develop a new multishot EPI technique called shuttered EPI, which addresses the lim- itations of conventional multishot EPI by imaging a set of spatially disjoint shutters in each shot. The shutters are produced by a multidimensional excitation pulse and are spatially shifted between shots to cover an entire slice. However, with thin slices the length of the excitation pulses are impractical (20-100 ms). Many-coil pTx (> 8 coils) can shorten the length of these pulses to feasible durations, but current 7 Tesla scanners have only 8 transmit channels due to cost, footprint, cabling, and other constraints. In the ﬁrst project period we pioneered a technique called array-compressed pTx (acpTx) which overcomes this limitation. Using acpTx, 8 transmit chan- nels can control an arbitrarily large number of coils, where the channels and coils are connected via an array compression network that is optimized with RF pulses for speciﬁc excitations. In this project, we will develop and apply acpTx methods and hardware (a many-coil head transmit array and an 8 channel-to-many coil array com- pression network) to achieve feasible RF pulse durations when exciting the shutter patterns required for shuttered EPI. These developments will be implemented on two major 7T scanner platforms and evaluated in submillimeter (600 micron) fMRI and dMRI acquisitions. Overall, the project encompasses the synergistic design of RF pulses, hardware, acquisitions and reconstructions to achieve a major advance in spatial encoding. Project Narrative Diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 7 Tesla ﬁeld strength using echo planar imaging (EPI) has the potential to deliver clear images of brain structure and function at the level of layers, columns, and nuclei. However, when existing EPI scans are pushed to the spatial resolutions required to resolve these structures, they become highly sensitive to off resonance-induced geometric distortions, relaxation-induced blur- ring, physiological noise and motion. To address this problem, in this project we will develop many-coil array- compressed parallel transmission and apply it to enable shuttered multishot EPI scans that are robust to these effects.",Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T,9850978,R01EB016695,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Homebound Persons', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Length', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Problem Formulations', 'Relaxation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cost', 'design', 'gray matter', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'motion sensitivity', 'neuroimaging', 'perfusion imaging', 'phase change', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'simulation', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'time use', 'transmission process', 'virtual']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,569563,0.01540194934256546
"Simulation Tools for 3D and 4D CT and Dosimetry Abstract Photon-counting CT (PCCT) is a major technological advance in CT imaging. Using photon-counting instead of current energy-integrating detectors, PCCT can offer superior performance in terms of spatial resolution, artifact reduction, and most notably, material decomposition. PCCT’s energy differentiation utility offers an ability to more precisely distinguish different materials and optimize and expand the use of contrast agents in CT. With these abilities, PCCT can significantly facilitate quantitative imaging, reduce radiation exposure, and enable revolutionary new applications in functional and physiological imaging beyond existing CT techniques. To realize the full potential of PCCT in clinical practice, the technology needs comprehensive assessments and application-based optimizations. Effective design and deployment of PCCT depends on many design and use choices that should be made in view of the eventual clinical utility. Making these choices requires large scale trials on actual patients. However, such trials are challenging, considering the need to make many decisions prior to prototyping, the limited numbers of prototype PCCT scanners available today, and the often-unknown ground-truth in the patient images. Even for existing prototype systems, many decisions require repetitive trials with multiple acquisitions. This is both unethical and impractical considering radiation safety concerns and costs. These challenges can be overcome by utilizing virtual imaging trials (VITs) using computerized patients and imaging models. VITs provide an efficient means with which to determine the most effective and optimized design and use of imaging technologies with complete control over the study design. In our prior funded project, we developed a VIT framework to evaluate standard energy-integrating detector CT technologies. In this project, we expand the applicability of this framework to photon-counting detector CT. Specifically, we enhance our computational XCAT phantoms to model the necessary higher-resolution detail including normal and abnormal tissue heterogeneities and intra-organ contrast perfusion diversity across populations (Aim 1). To image the phantoms, we develop the first PCCT simulator capable of mimicking existing and emerging prototypes (Aim 2). The enhanced VIT framework will provide the essential foundation with which to comprehensively evaluate and optimize PCCT technologies and applications. In Aim 3, we assess and optimize the use of PCCT for morphological, textural, and compositional quantification in select oncologic and cardiac applications, two leading health detriments in the US where PCCT can offer a notable impact. The results will be the first of their kind in comprehensively evaluating the task-based merits and capabilities of PCCT, determining optimum dose per patient size for PCCT imaging of patients for cancerous lesions and cardiac plaque/stenoses, and helping to establish the effective utility of PCCT in clinical care. The purpose of this project is to develop and utilize a virtual framework to comprehensively evaluate and optimize emerging photon-counting devices and applications in CT imaging. The results will be the first of their kind evaluating the task-based merits and capabilities of photon-counting CT and will help establish its effectual utility in oncologic and cardiac care.",Simulation Tools for 3D and 4D CT and Dosimetry,10051026,R01EB001838,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Anatomy', 'Cancerous', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Imaging technology', 'Industry', 'Lesion', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Population', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Specimen', 'Stenosis', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Texture', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cardiac plaque', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detector', 'dosimetry', 'experimental study', 'human imaging', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'photon-counting detector', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual imaging']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,545403,0.04197814627269939
"Quantitative Low-Dose PET Imaging Project summary Quantitative PET has become increasingly important in clinical management and research, in particular for predicting and assessing response to therapy for cancer patients. Current PET protocols involve injection of PET tracers that typically result in ~6-7 mSv radiation dose to patients. For patients who require multiple repeated PET scans to monitor the response to therapy, and for patients who need PET scans with two or more tracers (e.g., FDG + FLT) to optimally predict response to therapy, it is critical to reduce the radiation dose from the PET tracer injection, while still maintaining the quantitative accuracy and image quality for cancer management. When reducing injection dose, the PET images will have higher noise due to fewer detected counts, which will subsequently introduce errors in quantitative measurements. For moving organs and tumors such as those in the lung and abdomen, respiratory motion can substantially degrade quantitative accuracy, so motion correction is required. Conventional motion correction uses a gating strategy that rebins the PET data, resulting in substantially higher noise in each gate. More advanced methods incorporate motion vector estimation in the image domain for post-registration or motion compensated image reconstruction using all detected events without increasing noise. The motion vectors need to be derived from gated PET, which are even noisier when using a reduced tracer injection in low-dose studies, imposing substantial challenges for accurate and reliable voxel-by-voxel motion vector estimation. In dynamic PET studies with clinical cardiac tracers and other novel oncology and neurology tracers, quantification is even more challenging for low-dose PET as each dynamic frame only contains a small fraction of detected events so the high image noise will affect the determination of image-derived input functions and can lead to bias and high noise in parametric images. In this project, to reduce image noise and maintain quantitative accuracy in PET, we propose to develop, optimize, and evaluate multiple innovative imaging methods for low-dose PET data to achieve comparable quantitative accuracy as full-dose PET. While the imaging developments are generally applicable to all PET tracers in oncology, neurology, and cardiology, since cancer is the primary clinical application of PET, we will focus our investigation and optimization in this project on three lung cancer imaging tracers at different clinical adoption stages as examples: 1) 18F-FDG as a routine clinical tracer, 2) 18F-FMISO for hypoxia studies as a tracer for human research, and 3) 18F-PD-L1 that specifically binds to human PD-L1 in tumors and other organs as a recent first-in-human tracer.

"Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection Abstract PET is a molecular imaging modality widely used in oncology studies due to its high sensitivity and the potential of early diagnosis. For neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), 68Ga-DOTATATE PET has been recently used in clinical routine for imaging NETs in adult and pediatric patients since 2016. It plays an important role in the diagnosis and staging of NETs. However, compared to 18F-FDG PET, the image quality of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is lower due to much larger positron range, shorter half-life, and lower dose administration limited by generator capacity. All of these compromises the lesion detectability of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET, especially for small lesions, and can potentially lead to inaccurate NET diagnosis. As 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is increasingly used in clinics, there is an urgent and unmet need to further optimize 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging for NET detection. Recently, data-driven methods have been developed for PET image denoising, where the PET system model is not considered. As the tumor-to-background ratio of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is greater than 18F-FDG PET, the lesion recovery of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET can be hugely influenced by the smoothing effects as well as potential mismatches between training and testing datasets. In this study, we propose a novel data- informed and lesion detection-driven image reconstruction framework. The PET system model, image denoising module, and lesion-detection module will all be included in this reconstruction framework. The two specific aims of this exploratory proposal are (1) to develop a lesion detection-driven PET image reconstruction framework and validate it based on comprehensive computer simulations, (2) to apply the proposed reconstruction framework to existing clinical 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT datasets and test it based on various figure-of-merits. We expect that the integrated outcome of the specific aims will be a novel and robust image reconstruction framework to better recover lesions in a 68Ga- DOTATATE PET scan, which is essential for NET managements. Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection  Project Narrative Positron emission tomography (PET) is an imaging modality widely used in oncology. This project aims to develop a novel lesion detection-driven PET image reconstruction framework. Success of this project can enhance the lesion detectability of current PET imaging protocols, e.g. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT scanning for neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).",Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection,10041119,R03EB030280,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Biological Models', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Gallium', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Injections', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors', 'Noise', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Positron', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Reader', 'Recovery', 'Recurrence', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer type', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'effectiveness validation', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'molecular imaging', 'neural network', 'neuroendocrine differentiation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pediatric patients', 'pentetreotide', 'radiologist', 'radiotracer', 'reconstruction', 'routine imaging', 'success', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2020,94255,0.046056038806091486
"Multi-Task MR Simulation for Abdominal Radiation Treatment Planning ABSTRACT The accuracy of radiation treatment planning (RTP) heavily influences the effectiveness of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Individualized RTP begins with a “simulation”, in which the patient in a treatment position is commonly scanned using computed tomography (CT) to define the treatment target and organs at risk (OARs). When soft-tissue contrast is inadequate to support accurate target and OAR delineation in CT based RTP, conservatively large treatment margins are used to avoid a geometric miss. The crude treatment prevents delivering sufficient radiation dose to the tumor without exceeding the tolerance of surrounding normal tissues. Magnetic resonance (MR) can be used as a simulation platform complementary to CT for improved soft-tissue conspicuity. Yet, such a complicated, costly and tedious multi-modal RTP workflow along with unavoidable systematic MR-CT co-registration errors has limited its applications in EBRT, especially at the abdominal site whereby anatomies are highly mobile. Over the past few years, there is a keen interest in the integration of MR alone into RTP and even the therapy workflow (i.e. MR-guided radiotherapy, MRgRT). The abdomen poses critical challenges to MR simulation. Current MR imaging sequences are suboptimal to produce motion-free images and resolve respiratory motion. MR data processing for abdominal RTP is underdeveloped. Contouring of OARs typically relies on manual, tedious procedures that are time-consuming and variation-prone. In this proposal, we will substantially improve the MR acquisition and multi-organ auto-segmentation, so the potential of MR as a simulation modality can be fully unleashed for abdominal EBRT. Three specific aims will be completed. In Aim 1, we will develop a standalone multi-task MR (MT-MR) sequence dedicated to abdominal MR simulation. In Aim 2, we will optimize multi-organ auto-segmentation based on MT-MR images. In Aim 3, we will assess the performance of MT-MR in the context of pancreatic cancer stereotactic body radiotherapy planning. Successful completion of the project will dramatically improve treatment precision and clinical outcomes, thus further promoting the adoption of radiotherapy in the management of abdominal cancers. Moreover, the developed techniques will open the door to future studies aiming at optimizations in many aspects of radiotherapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Imaging is essential for precise radiation treatment planning. MR based planning is challenging in the abdomen whereby anatomies are highly mobile. We will substantially improve the MR acquisition and multi-organ auto- segmentation, so the potential of MR as an imaging-based planning modality can be fully unleashed for abdominal radiation treatment.",Multi-Task MR Simulation for Abdominal Radiation Treatment Planning,10053211,R01EB029088,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Abdomen', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Breathing', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of abdomen', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Planning Techniques', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Protons', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Study Subject', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Weight', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'interest', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'novel', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'segmentation algorithm', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,556712,0.05243161334788944
"Enabling the Next Generation of High Performance Pediatric Whole Body MR Imaging Project Abstract Motivation: We aim to develop and implement a new approach to transform pediatric MRI. The ultimate goal is ultra-fast and motion-robust imaging in a dedicated child-friendly environment to enable more children undergo MRI without anesthesia. For those who still require anesthesia, it will be briefer and lighter, and performed in a safer environment. This project leverages a small compact magnet, designed for adult brain MRI, with gradients that enable very fast imaging. With this magnet as an outstanding starting point, we will tailor our deep experience and multiple successes in developing new MRI approaches to high-density receiver coils, fast imaging sequences, and new image reconstruction methods to set a new standard for pediatric MRI. Approach: Although the compact scanner is designed for adult heads, with a 37 cm inner diameter, it can accommodate children under eight to ten years of age to image any body part. To transform this system for ideal pediatric scanning, three development aims will be pursued. The ﬁrst is to enable optimal signal reception. This will be accomplished through creating new receive chain electronics that are matched to the gradient capabilities, for ultra-high bandwidth imaging. This will be coupled to very thin and formed receive arrays that maximize the size of the patient that can be accommodated in the small bore of the scanner. The second aim is to develop methods of obtaining the highest performance out of the system by characterizing and correcting for its imperfections. This will be coupled to a bespoke approach to peripheral nerve stimulation, enabling maximal use of the gradients on each patient. These two developments will then be leveraged for high efﬁciency and motion robust noncartesian scanning. The ﬁnal aim is to develop a full environment and infrastructure that is well suited to pediatric imaging. Patient preparation and acclimation to MRI will be enhanced by virtual reality. Support equipment for anesthesia, new physiological sensors, and a novel child-friendly audiovisual system will be created. Signiﬁcance: The result of this project will be a revolutionary change in the way that MRI is used and per- formed for children. MRI will be more available, cheaper, safer, and have markedly improved image quality. Project Narrative We will leverage the outstanding magnet and gradients of a unique small bore MRI scanner to create a new standard for unprecedented whole-body pediatric MR imaging. We will develop, integrate, and validate a set of technologies speciﬁcally for pediatric imaging. These include ultra-high bandwidth MRI signal reception from thin form-ﬁtting hardware, high-speed image data acquisition and image reconstruction, and environmental support appropriate for children.",Enabling the Next Generation of High Performance Pediatric Whole Body MR Imaging,9944392,U01EB029427,"['10 year old', '8 year old', 'Acclimatization', 'Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Cone', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronics', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Flare', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Immersion', 'Infrastructure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Partner in relationship', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Nerve Stimulation', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Radiation', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Support System', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Vendor', 'base', 'commercialization', 'contrast imaging', 'data acquisition', 'density', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pediatric patients', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual reality', 'whole body imaging']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,887058,0.017825502043770865
"Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI Project Abstract Motivation: This is a competing renewal of our successful project, Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI, R01 EB009690. MRI offers superb soft tissue contrast for children, without the ionizing radiation and cancer risk of CT. However, MRI use has been limited due to long exams, low spatial resolution, and motion-artifacts. Thus, MRI often requires prolonged anesthesia with breath-holds and attendant risk; hence, children often lack the beneﬁts of cross-sectional imaging altogether or are exposed to ionizing radiation. The previous project addressed these concerns by creating a dedicated pediatric imaging system. Highly par- allel, high-SNR 3T receive coil arrays were designed and constructed speciﬁcally for pediatric body imaging. The high SNR was used to accelerate scans reconstructed with a combination of parallel imaging, new mo- tion correction algorithms, compressed sensing (CS), and higher dimensional imaging. The resulting system is now being used extensively in clinical practice, signiﬁcantly reducing anesthesia depth and duration, and has markedly increased our MRI utilization. Key technologies have been or are now being commercialized with GE Healthcare, including the pediatric receive array, CS, 4D ﬂow, full-Fourier single-shot T2-weighted scanning, and coil compression. Siemens has licensed ﬁve of our patents, implemented them in work-in-progress packages, and productized our coil compression and our ESPIRiT coil sensitivity estimation. Philips has licensed three of our patents. This ensures broad impact. Approach: Despite signiﬁcant progress and reduced anesthesia depth and duration, patient cooperation re- mains the main limitation to eliminate anesthesia in all pediatric body MRI exams. Many children will cooperate for several minutes, but then ﬁdget and get out of the scanner. Others are content until acoustic noise agi- tates them. Therefore the major emphasis now is greater exam execution speed, comprehensive elimination of acoustic noise, and increased robustness, particularly to contrast agent injection. The project has three interrelated development aims, validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable fast 2D imag- ing for quiet T2 and quiet low-distortion diffusion weighted imaging. A second aim is to develop free-breathing 3D contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted imaging that is silent and motion-robust. The third aim will enable au- tomated, smart scanning to speed the exam execution and adaptive protocols to increase the exam robustness. The impact of all of these developments in the clinic will then be assessed to assess the resulting reduction of anesthesia. Signiﬁcance: This work will lead to fast, robust, broadly-applicable pediatric MRI protocols with less anes- thesia, making MRI safer, cheaper, and more available to children. MRI will be transformed into a workhorse modality, reducing CT radiation burden. The techniques will facilitate wide application in the community setting and permit new MRI applications, for both pediatric and adult diseases. Project Narrative Pediatric MRI often requires anesthesia. After considerable progress reducing the depth and duration of anes- thesia, this work aims to reduce the frequency of anesthesia through a synergistic combination of fast, quiet, motion-robust, automated, and adaptive scanning. This will make MRI safer, cheaper, and more widely available to children, reducing the population risk of radiation from CT.",Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI,9927622,R01EB009690,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Body part', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Breathing', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational Technique', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Image Compression', 'Image Enhancement', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Legal patent', 'Letters', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatrics', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Speed', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'community setting', 'compliance behavior', 'contrast enhanced', 'data quality', 'design and construction', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient tolerability', 'pediatric patients', 'programs', 'radiation risk', 'reconstruction', 'skills', 'soft tissue', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,664041,0.03236336348752323
"Permeability Imaging using Simultaneous Dynamic PET and Arterial Spin Labeling MRI Abstract Candidate's Career Goals: Dr. Han has a strong background in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, image reconstruction and arterial spin labeling (ASL), with a Ph.D. in bio and brain engineering. Dr. Han is currently at a junior-faculty rank of instructor at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). His goal is to expand his future career to multi-modality positron emission tomography (PET)-MR imaging for translational research and clinical improvement. His long-term goal is to become an independent, accomplished investigator that can lead future scientific and clinical imaging projects taking full advantage of multi-modality PET-MR imaging. Career Development Plan: Foundational training in PET/PET-MR imaging as well as neurology is proposed for the candidate, an area that the candidate currently lacks knowledge and experience in. The candidate plans to engage in formal course work/seminars, research via one-on-one instructions with mentors and collaborators, conferences/presentations, manuscript/grant preparations, and teaching/leadership roles to grow as an independent investigator in the field of PET-MR imaging and neurology. Research Project: The overall goal of the proposed research is to take advantage of simultaneous dynamic PET and ASL-MR imaging to estimate the permeability surface product (PS) of the PET tracer, which is new physiological information that cannot be obtained with PET or MR alone. PS describes the unidirectional flux rate of macromolecules from the blood plasma into the interstitial space of cellular tissue and is the key metric for assessing the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Knowing the PS of the PET tracer provides powerful capability to probe the physiological delivery process of essential macromolecules involved in the pathogenesis of diseases in relation to BBB, due to the theoretically unlimiting potential in the design of radioactive analogs of important biological compounds. We plan to develop a PET tracer PS mapping method, achieve the first phantom and human study with PS mapping, and study the changes in the spatial distribution of tau neurofibrillary tangles (tau) and amyloid-beta (Aß) plaque depositions in relation to the BBB integrity changes with pathological events associated with the progression of AD, by performing dynamic-PET/mPLD-ASL studies using 18F-T807 and 11C- Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET tracers on AD and normal subjects. Environment: MGH provides an ideal setting for conducting research in MR, PET, and PET-MR imaging since multiple state-of-the-art imaging systems are available for preclinical/clinical MR scanners and preclinical simultaneous PET-MR scanners. There is a dynamic flow phantom designed to simulate blood flow for two compartment pharmacokinetics and an MR-compatible pump and detection system for continuous blood sampling suitable for performing ASL flow and PET imaging studies with arterial sampling. Also, there is a shared memory supercomputer ideal for the image reconstruction proposed in the project. MGH is also home to many experts in both PET-MR imaging and neurology who can provide their expertise to this project.

"Modeling and Assessment of Maternal Uteroplacental Circulation During Pregnancy ABSTRACT In this proposal I am interested in developing a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling approach for volumetric assessment of human uteroplacental blood flow in vivo. The placenta is an organ that exchanges nutrients and oxygen between the maternal circulation and the growing fetus. In the United States, about 3.4% of pregnancies per year are affected by hypertensive pregnancy disorders (HPD) such as preeclampsia (PE), which have been found to carry both fetal and maternal risk. Associated placental pathologies are believed to be linked to alterations in maternal arterial remodeling. Currently, Doppler ultrasound (US) is the primary method of assessing flow to the placenta from the uterine artery (UtA). Clinical studies have shown a relationship between high UtA flow resistance and risk of adverse pregnancy outcome late in gestation, but it has not been reliable as an early gestation screening tool. In order to improve predictive technologies for reliable risk assessment assessment of HPD, more research into the relationship between vessel structure and function in the UtA is needed. I hypothesize that CFD modeling can be a useful tool for investigating possible pathophysiological mechanisms of HPD by simulating complex hemodynamics of the maternal vascular system including pressure, wall shear stress, and pulse wave velocity. I plan to set up various 1D CFD simulations to understand the hemodynamic parameters of normal versus abnormal pregnancies. Then, I will validate the simulations with 4D flow MRI acquired from an in vitro flow phantom and a cohort of normal and hypertensive pregnant women. I anticipate that the results of this investigation can advance scientific knowledge regarding the progression of early HPD phenotypes to adverse pregnancy outcomes. This CFD study can also demonstrate the extent to which patient-specific hemodynamic simulations can be reliable for future improvement of clinical management. This training experience will provide opportunities to build my expertise in cardiovascular physiology, fluid mechanics, medical imaging, data analysis, and clinical care. I will be publishing articles on my CFD/4D flow MRI findings and communicating the impact of this work in medicine at various internal and external symposia. This research will be conducted under the mentorship of award-winning experts and the University of Pennsylvania in cardiovascular MRI (Walter Witschey), fluid mechanics and computational modeling (Paris Perdikaris), maternal fetal medicine (Nadav Schwartz) and cardiovascular physiology (Victor Ferrari). PROJECT NARRATIVE The human placenta is an understudied organ believed to play a critical role in pregnancy health and the pathophysiology of hypertensive pregnancy disorders. Current technologies like ultrasound are limited in its ability to assess complex hemodynamics, and clinical studies have not yet found reliable biomarkers of adverse pregnancy outcomes. We will develop a computational fluid dynamic model of the maternal vessels delivering blood to the placenta and validate it with magnetic resonance imaging to characterize uteroplacental structure and function, providing future avenues for new predictive biomarkers of pregnancy health.",Modeling and Assessment of Maternal Uteroplacental Circulation During Pregnancy,9991192,F31HD100171,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists', 'Angiography', 'Arteries', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doppler Ultrasound', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electric Capacitance', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Navier–Stokes equations', 'Nutrient', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Paris, France', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placentation', 'Play', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Training', 'Tube', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Uteroplacental Circulation', 'Uterus', 'Variant', 'Vascular System', 'Velocimetries', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'arterial remodeling', 'base', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'falls', 'fetal', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'maternal risk', 'neural network', 'non-invasive imaging', 'phantom model', 'predictive marker', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pressure', 'screening', 'shear stress', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'symposium', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,45520,0.016287569869798565
